Information about specific lung cancer as adenocarcinoma is even more limited. Genetic techniques can detect oncogene mutations which seem to be more frequent among cases of lung cancer in pregnant women and could determine both the treatment and prognosis. We present a recent case seen at our hospital and a literature review."   "2. Int J Cancer. 2019 Aug 1;145(3):649-661. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32133.

Simultaneously, the increasing number of targets and compounds poses the challenge of reliable, broad and timely molecular assays for the identification of patients likely to benefit from novel treatments. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and clinical utility of comprehensive, NGS-based genetic profiling for routine workup of advanced NSCLC based on the first 3,000 patients analyzed in our department. Following automated extraction of DNA and RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples, parallel sequencing of DNA and  RNA for detection of mutations and gene fusions, respectively, was performed using PCR-based enrichment with an ion semiconductor sequencing platform. Overall, 807 patients (27%) were eligible for currently approved, EGFR-/BRAF-/ALK- and ROS1-directed therapies, while 218 additional cases (7%) with MET, ERBB2 (HER2) and RET alterations could potentially benefit from experimental targeted compounds. In addition, routine capturing of comutations, e.g. TP53 (55%), KEAP1 (11%) and STK11 (11%), as well as the precise typing of fusion partners and involved exons in case of actionable translocations including ALK and ROS1, are prognostic and predictive tools currently gaining importance for further refinement of therapeutic and surveillance strategies. The reliability, low dropout rates (<5%), minimal tissue requirements, fast turnaround times (6 days on average) and lower costs of the diagnostic approach presented here compared to sequential single-gene testing, highlight its practicability in order to support individualized decisions in routine patient care, enrollment in molecularly stratified clinical trials, as well as translational research."

This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and robustness of using EBUS-EBNA samples to perform capture-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: Tissue samples from patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer were collected by EBUS-TBNA and were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. Three representative genes, EGFR, ALK, and ROS1, were examined by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The remaining samples were processed with NGS assay with a 56-gene panel. Classic driver mutations detected by NGS were verified by conventional methods. RESULTS: Of the 85 samples from patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, 77 were performed successfully with all assays. Forty-one mutations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 were detected in both conventional methods and NGS, representing a 100% concordance. In contrast, four EGFR mutations detected by NGS were not covered in the targeted regions of amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction, leading to a negative call in these patients. Altogether, NGS detected 12 additional variants, including six KRAS mutations, one BRAF mutation, one RET fusion, one MET amplification concurrent with EGFR L858R, one KRAS amplification together with EGFR 19del, and one ERBB2 amplification. The mean number of needle passes per lymph node was 5.2 in samples successfully applied in all assays. CONCLUSIONS: NGS assay can be successfully conducted with limited tissue samples  obtained from EBUS-TBNA. Compared with conventional methods, NGS assay provides more comprehensive information on genetic alterations in tumors, which greatly assists therapeutic decision making for advanced lung cancer."

Crizotinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and MET and a substrate of CYP3A. This post hoc analysis characterized the  use of concomitant CYP3A inducers with crizotinib and estimated the effect of dexamethasone use on crizotinib pharmacokinetics at steady state. METHODS: This analysis used data from four clinical studies (PROFILE 1001, 1005,  1007, and 1014) including 1690 patients with non-small cell lung cancer with ALK  or ROS1 rearrangements treated with crizotinib at 250 mg twice daily. Frequency and reasons for use of concomitant CYP3A inducers, including dexamethasone, with  crizotinib were characterized. Multiple steady-state trough concentrations (Ctrough,ss) of crizotinib were measured for each patient. A linear mixed-effects model was used for within-patient comparison of crizotinib Ctrough,ss between dosing of crizotinib alone and crizotinib coadministered with dexamethasone consecutively for ≥ 21 days. RESULTS: Dexamethasone was the most commonly used CYP3A inducer (30.4%). A total  of 15 patients had crizotinib Ctrough,ss for both crizotinib dosing with and without dexamethasone. The adjusted geometric mean ratio of crizotinib Ctrough,ss following coadministration with dexamethasone relative to crizotinib without dexamethasone, as a percentage, was 98.2% (90% confidence interval, 79.1-122.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib plasma exposure following coadministration with dexamethasone was similar to that when crizotinib was administered without dexamethasone, indicating dexamethasone has no effect on crizotinib exposure or efficacy. Other CYP3A inducers with similar potency would likewise have no clinically relevant effect on crizotinib exposure."

Chemotherapy outcomes are little known in this population. METHODS: The French Cooperative Thoracic Intergroup (IFCT) Biomarkers France study was a national prospective cohort study aiming to describe the molecular characteristics and clinical outcome of all consecutive NSCLC patients (N = 17,664) screened for molecular alterations. We used this data set to set up  a case-control analysis. Cases had stage IV BRAF-mutated (BRAF-MT) NSCLC, whereas controls had NSCLC that was wild-type for EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA and ALK. Each case was matched for sex, age at diagnosis and smoking status to two controls randomly selected. RESULTS: Overall, 83 cases with BRAF mutant disease (66.3% V600E) were matched to 166 controls. Five cases received tyrosine kinase inhibition in the first-line and 16 in the second-line. All others were treated with standard chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in first-line and second-line progression-free survival (PFS) between the groups, as well as in the disease control rate, BRAF mutation was not found to be prognostic of overall survival. We found no significant difference in outcome between the treatment types used in first-line or second-line in patients with BRAF-MT disease compared with controls nor between BRAF V600E or non-V600E compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF mutation is not a strong prognostic factor in NSCLC. Although taxan-based therapy shows poorest PFS in first-line, no chemotherapy regimen was  associated with prognosis."

Recent articles have referred to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation as  a resistance mechanism after ALK inhibitor treatments, but few reports have addressed ALK expression in treatment-naive SCLC in a comprehensive manner. Therefore, we examined ALK expression and the mechanisms in treatment-naive SCLCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined ALK expression in a consecutive series of SCLC tumours, and the expression mechanism was analysed regarding gene rearrangement,  copy number changes, and point mutations. We also examined whether SCLC with ALK  expression can be suppressed by crizotinib treatment in vitro. Immunohistochemical results revealed that ALK was expressed in 16 of 142 (11.3%)  SCLCs. The expression was focal and less intense, which is in contrast to strong  and uniform expression in adenocarcinoma with ALK rearrangement. Two combined SCLCs showed a positive reaction restricted to the SCLC component. None of the known genetic alterations, including rearrangement, amplification, copy number gain, or point mutations, were associated with ALK expression. A SCLC cell line,  SKLC2, which expressed ALK without known genetic alterations, was not inhibited by a practically achievable serum concentration of crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase immunohistochemistry for treatment-naive  SCLCs should not be used as a predictive biomarker for ALK inhibitor therapy, because the positive reactions were due to intrinsic expression of normal ALK transcript."

Methods: The Kaplan-Meier rwToT was estimated from electronic health record data for adults who initiated first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for stage IV, PD-L1 TPS ≥50% NSCLC, with negative/unknown EGFR/ALK aberrations, and ≥6 months' follow-up until database cutoff. Results: A total of 386 patients with ECOG 0-1 had a median rwToT of 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6-8.3) and 12-month on-treatment rate of 36.4% (31.2-41.6) versus 40.3% (32.5-47.9) and 37.6% (31.9-43.4) in KEYNOTE-024 (KN024) and KN042 (stage IV/TPS ≥50% subpopulation), respectively. The 24-month restricted-mean rwTOT (extrapolated) was 10.5 months (9.4-11.7), versus 11.0 (9.5-12.5) and 10.4 (9.3-11.5) in KN024 and KN042, respectively. Conclusion: First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy rwToT in metastatic PD-L1 TPS ≥50% NSCLC for trial-matched patients is similar to treatment duration in KN024 and KN042."

However, the optimal technique for maximizing yield continues to vary in the real-world setting. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA with capillary sampling compared with complete stylet removal for molecular testing. METHODS: Retrospective study, data from patients between January to May 2017 with indication of EBUS-TBNA whom ancillary testing, that is, next-generation sequencing, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and programed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression was reviewed. The yield of 2 techniques, stylet retracted halfway (group 1) versus complete retraction (group 2), was compared. RESULTS: A total of 24/27 (88.88%) samples were adequate for next-generation sequencing analysis in group 1 and 21/23 (91.30%) in group 2. For other molecular analyses, 24/27 (88.88%) samples in group 1 and 20/23 (86.95%) samples in group 2 were adequate for ALK analysis. 23/27 (85.18%) samples for group 1 and 20/23 (86.95%) samples for group 2 were adequate for PD-L1 analysis. Positive expression of PD-L1>50% was achieved in 9/23 (39.13%) of group 1 and 5/20 (25%) of group 2. There was no statistical difference in the yield between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: EBUS-TBNA using either capillary sampling or complete stylet removal  are effective and has a high proportion of satisfactory results for ancillary testing."

Epub 2018 Jun 20.","A case report: Pharmacology and resistance patterns of three generations of ALK inhibitors in metastatic inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma.","BACKGROUND: Little exists currently in research about the mechanisms of resistance of ALK inhibitors in inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma. It is known, however, that ALK gene rearrangements are common in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, similar to non-small cell lung cancer. In roughly 50% of  inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, gene rearrangement has been found to occur on chromosome 2 at band 2p23. In non-small cell lung cancer, it has been shown that about a third of patients who progress on the first generation ALK inhibitor, crizotinib develops mutations in the ALK kinase domain. The remaining  two-thirds of patients tend to develop amplification of ALK or activation of alternative signaling pathways. Chromoplexy has also been described as a mechanism of resistance, where multiple closed chain rearrangements cause loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes and gain-in-function of oncogenic fusions. Partner genes that have been identified in IMTs are tropomyosin 3 (TPM3), tropomyosin 4 (TPM4), clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), Ran-binding protein 2  (RANBP2), cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), and SEC31L1. All are  active promoters for the fusion gene, in response to NPM binding. Several inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor case reports indicated that fusion of ALK and  RANBP2 led to a more aggressive clinical course. Although the majority of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor case reports have utilized first and second generation ALK inhibitors, all generations of ALK inhibitors have demonstrated some ability to impair disease progression and extend life expectancy. However, at some point in the course of therapy with each generation of ALK inhibitor, resistance ultimately developed. In order to better understand the pharmacology and resistance patterns behind three generations of ALK inhibitors, we sought to  examine a patient with metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1-rearranged inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma to the brain. We also explored the similarities and differences of this clinical case to other inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma case reports involving the use of ALK inhibitors. CASE REPORT: A rare case of pulmonary IMS with ALK-1 gene rearrangement and multiple brain metastases responded to three generations of ALK inhibitors. However, similar to other case reports, due to the development of resistance and  recurrence, the patient eventually succumbed to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: ALK inhibitors are beneficial in the temporary prevention of progression of disease in patients with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. In this case, due to the inability to reveal the fusion partner in this patient via  DNA sequencing, it is unknown exactly if that partner was RANBP2 or another ALK partner gene. Brain biopsy tissue was also unobtainable during sequence of ALK due to risk versus benefit, which would have provided insight as which type of ALK resistance mutations the patient was developing. It is likely that this patient had some form of chromoplexy occurring."

The identification of clinically actionable molecular alterations helps to guide personalized cancer treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 789 resected NSCLC cases were reviewed. Fifty-nine NSCLC cases lacking morphologic differentiation, accounting  for 7.5% of all resected NSCLCs, were identified and further characterized by immunohistochemistry according to the 2015 WHO lung tumor classification. Molecular alterations were investigated by multiple technologies including target capture sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridizations. RESULTS: Of 59 NSCLC cases lacking morphologic differentiation, 20 (33.9%) were reclassified as adenocarcinoma (LCC-AD), 14 (23.7%) as squamous cell carcinoma (LCC-SqCC), and 25 (42.4%) as LCC-Null. Approximately 92% of LCC-Null, 95% of LCC-AD, and 86% of LCC-SqCC harbored clinically relevant alterations. Alterations characteristic of adenocarcinoma (EGFR, KRAS, ALK receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK], ROS1, and serine/threonine kinase 11 [STK11]) were detected in the LCC-AD subgroup but not in LCC-SqCC, whereas squamous-lineage alterations (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha [PIK3CA],  SRY-box 2 [SOX2], fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 [FGFR1], and AKT1) were detected in the LCC-SqCC subgroup but not in the LCC-AD group. Although some LCC-Null tumors displayed a genetic profile similar to either adenocarcinoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, more than half of the LCC-Null group were completely devoid of recognizable lineage-specific genetic profiles. High programmed death ligand 1 expression and high frequency of cell cycle regulatory gene alterations  were found in the LCC-Null group offering alternative options of targeted therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive molecular study provided further insight into the genetic architecture of LCC. The presence of clinically actionable alterations in a majority of the tumors allowed personalized treatment to emerge."

The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib. Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit. We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017). METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal. PFS was determined by the investigators. Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced. Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58). The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib. EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient  plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response. Investigator-assessed PFS  was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue. Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the  case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib. CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant."

IMpower130 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy for non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: IMpower130 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done in 131 centres across eight countries (the USA, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Israel). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1,  and received no previous chemotherapy for stage IV disease. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1; permuted block [block size of six] with an interactive voice or web response system) to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (carboplatin [area under the curve 6 mg/mL per min every 3 weeks] plus nab-paclitaxel [100 mg/m2 intravenously every week]) or chemotherapy alone for four or six 21-day cycles followed by maintenance therapy. Stratification factors were sex, baseline liver metastases, and PD-L1 tumour expression. Co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat wild-type (ie, EGFRwt and ALKwt) population. The safety population included patients who received at least  one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02367781. FINDINGS: Between April 16, 2015, and Feb 13, 2017, 724 patients were randomly assigned and 723 were included in the intention-to-treat population (one patient  died before randomisation, but was assigned to a treatment group; this patient was excluded from the intention-to-treat population) of the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group (483 patients in the intention-to-treat population and 451 patients in the intention-to-treat wild-type population) or the chemotherapy group (240 patients in the intention-to-treat population and 228 patients in the  intention-to-treat wild-type population). Median follow-up in the intention-to-treat wild-type population was similar between groups (18·5 months [IQR 15·2-23·6] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 19·2 months [15·4-23·0] in the chemotherapy group). In the intention-to-treat wild-type population, there were significant improvements in median overall survival (18·6  months [95% CI 16·0-21·2] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 13·9 months [12·0-18·7] in the chemotherapy group; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·79 [95% CI 0·64-0·98]; p=0·033) and median progression-free survival (7·0 months [95% CI 6·2-7·3] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 5·5 months [4·4-5·9] in the chemotherapy group; stratified HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·54-0·77]; p<0·0001]). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (152 [32%] of 473 in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group vs 65 [28%] of 232 in the chemotherapy group), anaemia (138 [29%] vs 47 [20%]), and  decreased neutrophil count (57 [12%] vs 19 [8%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 112 (24%) of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 30 (13%) of 232 patients in the chemotherapy group. Treatment-related (any treatment) deaths occurred in eight (2%) of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and one (<1%) of 232 patients in the  chemotherapy group. INTERPRETATION: IMpower130 showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival and a significant improvement in progression-free survival with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and no ALK or EGFR mutations. No new safety signals were identified. This study supports the benefit of atezolizumab, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, as first-line treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer."

Although ROS1-rearranged tumors are known to have characteristic histologic features, only a few studies have investigated the histologic features of advanced-stage ROS1-rearranged tumors. METHODS: We analyzed the histopathologic features of ROS1-rearranged tumors in advanced-stage NSCLC patients and assessed the ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining patterns of ROS1-rearranged cases. RESULTS: A total of 37 ROS1 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-positive cases and 64 ROS1 FISH-negative cases were analyzed, and all tumors were EGFR-, ALK-, and RET-negative. Solid pattern, round nuclei with macronucleoli, solid signet-ring cells, extracellular mucin, and a close relation with adjacent bronchioles were significantly associated with ROS1 rearrangement, and the solid  signet-ring cell feature was exclusively identified in ROS1-rearranged tumors. ROS1 IHC showed a 97.3% sensitivity when weak to strong protein expression was considered positive. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight distinct histologic features of ROS1-rearranged tumors, including their nuclear features. A thorough understanding of ROS1 rearrangement-related histologic features would be helpful  to identify ROS1-rearranged tumors in advanced-stage NSCLC"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of 106 patients (pts) from five Institutions treated with RT concomitant to TKI were retrospectively revised. Overall survival (OS) and toxicities were analyzed as endpoints of the study. RESULTS: Median age of pts was 65 years. TKIs were given for EGFR (81%)- or ALK (19%)-mutated metastatic NSCLC. Stereotactic RT (SRT) was delivered to 49 pts (46%). Patients with four or less metastasis were defined as oligometastatic/oligoprogressive (OM/OP); sites of RT were brain, bone, lung or others in 46%, 27%, 14% and 13%, respectively. Median OS was 23 months. At univariate analysis SRT, ECOG PS 0-1, OM/OP disease, lung sites and a TKI duration longer than median favorably affected OS (all p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed SRT (HR 0.355, CI 95% 0.212-0.595; p < 0.001) and median duration of TKI > 14 months (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.10-0.30; p < 0.001) as independent factors related to better OS. Toxicities were rare. CONCLUSIONS: SRT seems to positively affect OS with limited toxicity in selected  patients."

METHODS: A total of 689 patients with stage I-III lung adenocarcinomas (male:female = 334:355; median age, 64 years) underwent complete surgical resection between 2007 and 2013. The prognostic impact of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement on OS was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Certain clinicopathological prognostic factors (i.e., age, sex, smoking status, nodule type, solid portion size, pathologic stage, adenocarcinoma subtype, and history of adjuvant chemotherapy) were included for adjustments of the hazard ratio (HR). RESULTS: EGFR mutation was observed in 438 patients (64%) and ALK rearrangement was seen in 28 patients (4%). Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression demonstrated  that the prognostic effect of EGFR mutation on OS differed by age (HR, exp.[-5.199 + 0.064* age]). The adjusted HR for EGFR mutation was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.05-0.36; P < 0.001) at 50 years, 0.26 (95% CI: 0.15-0.46; P < 0.001) at 60 years, and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31-0.81; P = 0.005) at 70 years. However, the effect of ALK rearrangement on OS was without statistical significance (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EGFR mutation was independently prognostic of the long-term outcomes of patients with surgically treated lung adenocarcinomas. A more favorable prognostic effect was seen in younger than in older patients. ALK rearrangement was not associated with OS."

However, the real-world evaluation status of ALK/EGFR in China remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study including 1134 patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC (stage IIIb-IV) at 12 Chinese hospitals. RESULTS: The most common evaluation methods were amplification-refractory mutation system for EGFR status and immunohistochemistry targeting D5F3 for ALK status. Among patients with non-squamous, the EGFR mutation rate was 44.1% and the ALK rearrangement rate was 10.0%. Among patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the EGFR mutation rate was 8.3% and the ALK rearrangement rate was 3.7%. Among all patients, gender (HR = 1.7, 95%CI = 1.2-2.4, P = 0.006), smoking  history (HR = 1.8, 95%CI = 1.3-2.7, P = 0.001), histology (HR = 5.0, 95%CI = 2.4-10.1, P < 0.001), and brain metastases (HR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.1-2.2, P = 0.017) were independent predictors of EGFR mutation, while age (HR = 2.6, 95%CI = 1.7-4.1, P < 0.001) was an independent predictor of ALK rearrangement. The median time from tumor diagnosis to EGFR or ALK status confirmation was 7 and 5 days, respectively. Targeted therapy rate was 73.8% in EGFR-positive patients and 51.4% in ALK-positive patients. There was a negative correlation between the first-line targeted therapy rate and the EGFR mutation detection period (r = -0.152, P = 0.02), while no significant correlation among patients with ALK rearrangement (r  = -0.179, P = 0.076). CONCLUSION: Squamous NSCLC patients should also be routinely tested to determine  their EGFR/ALK statuses. The first-line targeted therapy rate remains low in Chinese patients with NSCLC."

Currently, different targeted therapies and ROS1 inhibitors have been discovered, but all are in different investigational phases, with only one (crizotinib) which is FDA approved. Crizotinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which was discovered to actively inhibit ALK, MET, and ROS1. Crizotinib has shown to be remarkably efficacious against ROS1 lung cancer, prompting ROS1 detection in lung cancer to be quite significant. Sadly, crizotinib resistance in ROS1 is a frequent occurrence which poses a major clinical challenge in the successful treatment of ROS1 lung cancer; hence, the discovery of the second and third generation ROS1 inhibitors is of utmost importance. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms through which ROS1 tumor cells acquire resistance to crizotinib-the first-line drug for ROS1-positive NSCLC, and summarize various new potent drugs which can overcome this resistance and serve as viable alternatives."

Here, we present a comprehensive genomic landscape of 11 ALK+ NSCLC patients and investigate its relationship with response to crizotinib. Using whole exome sequencing and RNAseq data, we identified 4 rare ALK fusion partners (HIP1, GCC2, ERC1 and SLC16A7), and 1 novel partner (CEP55). At the mutation level, TP53 was the most frequently  mutated gene, and was only observed in patients with the shortest progression free survival (PFS). Of note, only 4% of the genes carrying mutations are present in more than one patient. Analysis of somatic copy number aberrations (SCNA) demonstrated that a gain in EML4 was associated with longer PFS and a loss of ALK or gain in EGFR were associated with shorter PFS. This study is the first to report a comprehensive view of the ALK+ NSCLC copy number landscape and to identify SCNA regions associated with clinical outcome. Our data show presence of TP53 mutation as a strong prognostic indication of poor clinical response in ALK+ NSCLC. Furthermore, new and rare ALK fusion partners were observed in the present cohort expanding our knowledge in ALK+ NSCLC"

Aiming to explore new potent inhibitors, a series of 2-amino-4-(1-piperidine) pyridine derivatives that stabilized a novel DFG-shifted conformation in the kinase domain of ALK were designed and synthesized on the base of lead compound A. Biological evaluation highlighted that most of these new compounds could also potently inhibit ROS1 kinase, leading to the promising inhibitors against both ROS1 and ALK. Among them, the representative compound 2e stood out potent anti-proliferative activity against ALK-addicted H3122 and ROS1-addicted HCC78 cell lines (IC50 = 6.27 μM and 10.71 μM, respectively), which were comparable to that of Crizotinib. Moreover, 2e showed impressive enzyme activity against clinically Crizotinib-resistant ALKL1196M with an IC50 value of 41.3 nM, which was about 2-fold more potent than  that of Crizotinib. 2e also showed potent inhibitory activity in about 6-fold superior to Crizotinib (IC50: 104.7 nM vs. 643.5 nM) in Ba/F3 cell line harboring ROS1G2032R. Furthermore, molecular modeling disclosed that all the representative inhibitors could dock into the active site of ALK and ROS1, which gave a probable explanation of anti Crizotinib-resistant mutants. These results indicated that our work has established a path forward for the generation of anti Crizotinib-resistant ALK/ROS1 dual inhibitors"

This study estimated utilities based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30), a widely used measure  of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in oncology, using published mapping algorithms. Materials and methods: Data were from the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase  (ALK) in Lung Cancer Trial of brigatinib (ALTA; NCT02094573), an open-label, international, phase 2 study. ALTA evaluated the efficacy and safety of two randomized dosing regimens of brigatinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK + non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed on prior  therapy with crizotinib. QLQ-C30 scores were mapped to European Quality-of-Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) utility scores using two published algorithms (Khan et al. for EQ-5D-5L; Longworth et al. for EQ-5D-3L). The impact of brigatinib treatment on health utilities over time was assessed. Results: The analysis included 208 subjects. Mean baseline utility scores for both algorithms ranged between 0.60 - 0.71 and increased to 0.78 by cycle 5. Utility improvements were sustained during most of the treatment, before disease progression. Minor variations were observed between utility scores; Khan et al. estimates were approximately 0.01 or 0.02 points lower than Longworth et al. estimates. Limitations: Algorithms considered were limited to those available in the published literature at the time of the study. This utility analysis was exploratory, and the ALTA trial did  not include an internal control group (i.e. standard of care) and was not powered to detect differences in QoL/utility outcomes between treatment arms. Conclusions: Converting QLQ-C30 scores into utilities in trials using established mapping algorithms can improve evaluation of medicines from the patient perspective. Both algorithms suggested that brigatinib improved health utility in crizotinib-refractory ALK + NSCLC patients, and improvements were maintained during most of the treatment.

Here we present our experience on pneumonic-type lung carcinoma in an attempt to investigate the clinical, radiological and pathological features, diagnostic procedures, treatment, and prognosis of this type of tumor. METHODS: Pathologically confirmed lung cancer with a chest CT characterized by ground glass opacity or consolidation was defined as pneumonic-type lung carcinoma. Cases with advanced pneumonic-type lung carcinoma admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) from January 1, 2013 to August 30, 2018 were enrolled. Retrospective analysis of clinical data and survival follow-up of  these patients was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 46 cases were enrolled, all of which were adenocarcinoma. Cough (41/46, 89.1%) and expectoration (35/46, 76.1%) were the most prominent symptoms. The most frequent chest CT findings were ground glass attenuation (87.0%), patchy consolidation (84.8%), and multiple ground-glass nodules (84.8%). Multiple cystic changes (40%) and cavitation (13%) were also quite frequent. Ipsilateral and contralateral intrapulmonary metastasis were noted in 95.3% and 84.8% of cases respectively. The median duration from symptom onset to diagnosis  was 214 days (95%CI: 129-298). Both surgical lung biopsy and CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy had a diagnostic yield of 100%. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) combined with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) had a diagnostic yield of 80.9% (17/21). Sputum cytology had a diagnostic yield of 45% (9/20). Twenty-six cases were invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (26/46, 56.5%) and the remainder were unable to identify pathological subtypes due to lack of adequate biopsy sample size. EGFR mutation was detected in 15.8% (6/38) of patients and ALK rearrangement was detected in 3.0% (1/33) of patients. The median overall survival for these patients was 522 d (95%CI: 424-619). In patients without EGFR  mutation or ALK rearrangement, chemotherapy significantly improved survival (HR=0.155, P=0.002,2). The median overall survival was 547 d (95%CI: 492-602 d) with chemotherapy and 331 d (95%CI: 22-919) without chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of pneumonic-type carcinoma is usually delayed due to clinical and radiological features mimicking pulmonary infection. TBLB combined with BAL has a quite high diagnostic yield. The most frequent histological type is invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. The incidence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement is low in pneumonic-type carcinoma. For patients without cancer driver genes, chemotherapy is recommended to improve overall survival."

[Epub ahead of  print]","Validation of a Next-Generation Sequencing Assay Targeting RNA for the Multiplexed Detection of Fusion Transcripts and Oncogenic Isoforms.","CONTEXT.—: Next-generation sequencing is a high-throughput method for detecting genetic abnormalities and providing prognostic and therapeutic information for patients with cancer. Oncogenic fusion transcripts are among the various classifications of genetic abnormalities present in tumors and are typically detected clinically with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, FISH probes only exist for a limited number of targets, do not provide any information about fusion partners, cannot be multiplex, and have been shown to be limited in  specificity for common targets such as ALK. OBJECTIVE.—: To validate an anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based panel for the detection of fusion transcripts in a university hospital-based clinical molecular diagnostics laboratory. DESIGN.—: We used 109 unique clinical specimens to validate a custom panel targeting 104 exon boundaries from 17 genes involved in fusions in solid tumors.  The panel can accept as little as 100 ng of total nucleic acid from PreservCyt-fixed tissue, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens with as  little as 10% tumor nuclei. RESULTS.—: Using FISH as the gold standard, this assay has a sensitivity of 88.46% and a specificity of 95.83% for the detection of fusion transcripts involving ALK, RET, and ROS1 in lung adenocarcinomas. Using a validated next-generation sequencing assay as the orthogonal gold standard for the detection of EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) in glioblastomas, the assay is 92.31% sensitive and 100% specific. CONCLUSIONS.—: This multiplexed assay is tumor and fusion partner agnostic and will provide clinical utility in therapy selection for patients with solid tumors."

Their photoluminescence properties, solution stabilities, hydrophilicity/lipophilicity properties and anti-proliferative activity against three cancer cell lines as well as structure-function relationships are analyzed. All the complexes, which show high solution stabilities and lipophilicity under determination conditions, reveal much higher  antiproliferative activities than cisplatin against the human lung carcinoma cell line (A549), human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Bel-7042) and human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) in vitro. Fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroic analysis reveal that the compounds have strong affinity binding with ctDNA and stack onto the base pairs of the ctDNA. The results obtained are further explained in terms of the electronic properties of the compounds by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and it is found that the halogen anions play critical roles in the antitumor activity of these compounds. Their affinities to HSP90 proteins, ALK, EGFR and HER2 kinases and the binding sites on these proteins have been determined by computational docking analysis, and the results indicate that the only form of their binding is van der Waals forces."

Cancer cell heterogeneity and primary or acquired resistance mechanisms cause the elusive behaviour of this cancer and new biomarkers and active drugs are urgently needed to overcome these limitations. p65BTK, a novel isoform of the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase may represent a new actionable target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: p65BTK expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 382 NSCLC patients with complete clinico-pathological records including smoking habit, ALK  and EGFR status, and in metastatic lymph nodes of 30 NSCLC patients. NSCLC cell lines mutated for p53 and/or a component of the RAS/MAPK pathway and primary lung cancer-derived cells from Kras/Trp53 null mice were used as a preclinical model.  The effects of p65BTK inhibition by BTK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) (Ibrutinib, AVL-292, RN486) and first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib, Erlotinib) on cell viability were evaluated by MTT. The effects of BTK-TKIs on cell growth and clonogenicity were assessed by crystal violet and colony assays, respectively. Cell toxicity assays were performed to study the effect of the combination of non-toxic concentrations of BTK-TKIs with EGFR-TKIs and standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Gemcitabine, Pemetrexed). RESULTS: p65BTK was significantly over-expressed in EGFR-wild type (wt) adenocarcinomas (AdC) from non-smoker patients and its expression was also preserved at the metastatic site. p65BTK was also over-expressed in cell lines mutated for KRAS or for a component of the RAS/MAPK pathway and in tumors from Kras/Trp53 null mice. BTK-TKIs were more effective than EGFR-TKIs in decreasing cancer cell viability and significantly impaired cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Moreover, non-toxic doses of BTK-TKIs re-sensitized drug-resistant NSCLC cell lines to both target- and SOC therapy, independently from EGFR/KRAS status. CONCLUSIONS: p65BTK results as an emerging actionable target in non-smoking EGFR-wt AdC, also at advanced stages of disease. Notably, these patients are not  eligible for EGFR-TKIs-based therapy due to a lack of EGFR mutation. The combination of BTK-TKIs with EGFR-TKIs is cytotoxic for EGFR-wt/KRAS-mutant/p53-null tumors and BTK-TKIs re-sensitizes drug-resistant NSCLC to SOC chemotherapy. Therefore, our data suggest that adding BTK-TKIs to SOC chemotherapy and EGFR-targeted therapy may open new avenues for clinical trials in currently untreatable NSCLC."

Unlike other collateral rearrangements, these fusion-oncogene-associated rearrangements  were frequently copy-number-balanced, representing a genomic signature of early oncogenesis. Analysis of mutation timing revealed that fusions and point mutations of canonical oncogenes were often acquired in the early decades of life. During a long latency, cancer-related genes were disrupted or amplified by  complex rearrangements. The genomic landscape was different between subgroups-EGFR-mutant LADCs had frequent whole-genome duplications with p53 mutations, whereas fusion-oncogene-driven LADCs had frequent SETD2 mutations. Our study highlights LADC oncogenesis driven by endogenous mutational processes."

The clinico-pathological features of HPD still remain unclear. Here we report a 65-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma who abruptly presented HPD two days after pembrolizumab administration. The primary tumor increased in size from 40 mm to 57 mm on the chest HRCT. The patient died on day  37 after pembrolizumab administration. The autopsy demonstrated widespread progression of cancer cells into the alveolar spaces and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the left lung, with plenty of bloody pleural effusion. We compared the pathohistology and immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 between the pretreatment biopsy material and posttreatment autopsy materials, and found a change in PD-L1 expression which may be related to HPD. We also discuss the possibility of HPD, pseudoprogression, and interstitial lung disease when there is evidence of tumor growth or ground glass shadows on chest images after ICI treatment."

Clinical trials investigating immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have usually excluded patients with oncogenic drivers, so that the outcome of these agents in  this population is poorly known. In patients with oncogenic addiction, targeted therapy remains clearly the best option, and the place of immunotherapy in this population has not been clearly defined yet.Based on available data, we suggest that (i) immunotherapy single agent should be proposed only after exhaustion of more validated treatments, (ii) combinations of immunotherapy with targeted therapies are of interest provided that we can manage toxicity and find the best  sequence, (iii) a combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy may be appealing in patients pretreated with targeted agents. The best way to opt in for the best  strategy will depend upon the identification of adequate biomarkers. New basic and clinical research is awaited in this field."

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyze the starting doses of oral EGFR and ALK TKIs in patients diagnosed with NSCLC at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review with patients on EGFR and ALK  TKIs for NSCLC. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: patients initiated on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standard dose (SD) and patients initiated on a reduced dose (RD). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and other treatment outcomes were compared between both groups. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included for analysis. The median time-to-progression for the SD group (n = 67) and RD group (n = 23) were 13.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]:8.9-15.6) and 15.1 months (95%CI: 5.6-21.5), respectively. Median time-to-death was not estimable for OS. The predicted OS probability at approximately 15 months post treatment initiation for the SD group and RD group was 81.8% and 80.5%, respectively.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ALK gene rearrangements or the resulting  fusion proteins have been, for the most part, successfully targeted with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The most frequent rearrangement, the EML4-ALK  oncogenic fusion, has more than 10 distinct variants, each with a discrete breakpoint in EML4 Recent studies have suggested that EML4-ALK variants may have  differential responses to TKIs. Additionally, non-EML4-ALK fusions that result from ALK rearrangements with diverse 5' partners could possibly have varied biologic and clinical implications in their therapeutic responses and outcomes of patients with NSCLC. Existing literature documents at least 20 non-EML4 fusion partners for ALK, and the clinical responsiveness to crizotinib ranges from increased sensitivity to resistance. This underscores the importance of identifying the precise 5' fusion partner to ALK before initiation of therapy. Herein we report the identification of a novel SLMAP-ALK fusion in a patient with NSCLC."

METHODS: We evaluated 173 specimens obtained from patients with lung adenocarcinoma in northeastern Brazil. Expression of PD-L1 and ALK was evaluated  by immunohistochemistry; EGFR mutation status was evaluated by sequencing. We categorized the histological subtypes in accordance with the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification. RESULTS: The most common histological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma were solid  predominant (in 46.8%), acinar predominant (in 37.0%), and lepidic predominant (in 9.8%). ALK expression was detected in 10.4% of the samples, and 22.0% of the  tumors harbored EGFR mutations. The most common EGFR mutation was an exon 21 L858R point mutation (in 45.5%), followed by an exon 19 deletion (in 36.3%). The  tumor proportion score for PD-L1 expression was ≥ 50% in 18.2% of the samples, 1-49% in 32.7%, and 0% in 49.5%. The solid predominant subtype was significantly  associated with wild-type EGFR status (p = 0.047). Positivity for PD-L1 expression was not found to be significantly associated with ALK expression or EGFR mutation status. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the molecular profile of non-small cell lung cancer in northeastern Brazil differs from those of populations in other regions of the country, with ALK positivity being higher than the other biomarkers. Further studies including clinical and genetic information are required to confirm these differences, as well as studies focusing on populations living in different areas of the country."

STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles evaluating brigatinib were analyzed for this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Brigatinib was granted approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. It is administered at a dose of 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days then, if tolerated, increased to a dose of 180 mg orally once daily. Common adverse effects include nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, increased creatine phosphokinase levels, headache, dyspnea, and hypertension. Serious treatment-emergent adverse effects were pulmonary related. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This article discusses the clinical trials that led to the accelerated approval of brigatinib for its ability to overcome crizotinib-resistant mutations and for its increased central nervous system penetration properties. CONCLUSION: Brigatinib was granted accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib.

The evaluation of  the clinical features and therapeutic response associated with this NSCLC subtype will be vital for understanding the heterogeneity of treatment response and improving the management of these patients. METHODS: This retrospective study included 3774 samples from patients diagnosed with NSCLC. All samples were screened for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, and BRAF mutation using the amplification-refractory mutation system. The relationship between concomitant driver mutations and clinicopathologic characteristics, and patient clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty-three (1.7%) samples had more than one driver gene mutation. Among these, 43 were coalterations with an EGFR mutation, 20 with an ALK rearrangement, and eight with an ROS1 rearrangement. Except for ROS1 concomitant mutations that  were more frequent in male patients (87.5%, P = 0.020), the clinicopathological features of the concomitant mutation patients were not significantly different from those harboring a single EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutation. Furthermore, first-line EGFR-TKI treatment did not significantly improve the progression-free  survival (PFS) of patients harboring EGFR concomitant mutation, compared to patients harboring a single EGFR mutation. However, for EGFR concomitant mutation patients, TKI therapy was more effective than chemotherapy (median PFS of 10.8 vs 5.2 months, P = 0.023). Lastly, KRAS mutations did not influence the EGFR-TKI therapy treatment effect. CONCLUSION: In this study, concomitant mutations were found in 1.7% of the NSCLC. EGFR-TKI therapy was more effective than chemotherapy for patients harboring EGFR concomitant mutation, and ROS1 concomitant mutations were more frequent in male patients. For patients harboring coalterations with an ALK or ROS1 rearrangement, we should be cautious when considering the therapeutic options."

This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical features and prognostic factors of NSCLC patients with LM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of NSCLC patients with LM at the Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute between July 2014 and March 2018. Identified cases had pathology-proven NSCLC with either positive cerebrospinal fluid cytology or leptomeningeal enhancement by MRI. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six NSCLC patients (58 men, 78 women) with LM were enrolled in the retrospective study; median age was 55 years (range, 29-89 years). Fifty-one patients harbored EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangement was detected in 6 patients. Treatment for LM consisted of EGFR-TKIs alone in 11 patients, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone in 19 patients, Chemotherapy (ChT) alone in 12 patients, EGFR-TKIs plus WBRT in 30 patients, WBRT plus ChT in  25 patients, and EGFR-TKIs plus ChT in 24 patients. The median progression-free survival was 3.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.178-4.622), and the median overall survival (OSLM ) was 9.8 months (95% CI:7.5-12.1). Thirty patients who received WBRT plus EGFR-TKIs achieved longer survival than those who only received WBRT (median 13.6 vs 8.8 months; P = 0.027), but did not add any survival benefit than those only received EGFR-TKIs (median 13.6 vs 13.9 months;  P = 0.352). A multivariate analysis indicated that KPS ≥ 80 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.592, 95% CI:0.369-0.95; P = 0.03) and EGFR-TKIs (HR = 0.507, 95% CI:0.283-0.908; P = 0.022) after LM diagnosis were independent favourable predictors of survival, whereas smoking (HR = 1.181, 95% CI:1.009-3.246; P = 0.047) was an independent predictor of poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that patients with good performance statuses, non-smoking patients, and the administration of EGFR-TKIs might improve clinical  outcomes in NSCLC patients with LM."

A cohort of 785 Chinese patients with NSCLC who underwent resection from March 2016 to November 2017 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University was investigated. The specimens were subjected to hybridization capture and sequence of 8 important NSCLC-related driver genes. In addition, the  slides were tested for PD-L1, excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1), thymidylate synthase (TS) and β-tubulin III by immunohistochemical staining. A total of 498 (63.4%) patients had at least 1 driver gene alteration. Wild-type, EGFR rare mutation (mut), ALK fusion (fus), RAS mut, RET fus and MET mut had relatively higher proportions of lower ERCC1 expression. EGFR 19del, EGFR L858R, EGFR rare mut, ALK fus, HER2 mut, ROS1 fus and MET mut were more likely to have TS low expression. Wild-type, EGFR L858R, EGFR rare mut and BRAF mut were associated with lower β-tubulin III expression. In addition, wild-type, RAS mut, ROS1 fus, BRAF and MET mut had higher proportion of PD-L1 high expression. As a pilot validation, 21 wild-type patients with advanced NSCLC showed better depth of response and response rate to taxanes compared with pemetrexed/gemcitabine (31.2%/60.0% vs 26.6%/45.5%).

The recent association of four oncogenic driver genes, ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1, as lung tumor predictive biomarkers has increased the need for precision medicine. We used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of non-small cell lung cancer from 150 EGFR mutation-negative cases and 10 fusion status-known cases and compared the performance of the Oncomine Dx Fusion Transcript Test (ODxFT) with FISH break-apart for the detection of ALK, RET, and ROS1 fusion genes. RNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue samples with or without macrodissection under hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the ALK fusion  gene was independently determined using these assays. Fusion detection analyses were successfully carried out using ODxFT in 150 cases, with only one invalid case. ALK fusion genes were detected at a frequency of 7.3% (11/150) in the lung  cancer specimens. Concordance rate between the ODxFT and ALK-FISH analyses was 99.3% (148/149). Sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% and 99.3%, respectively.  All the samples with a known fusion status were accurately matched between the two assays. Our results show a high concordance rate between the ODxFT and ALK-FISH analyses.

However, acquired resistance to TKIs invariably develops within approximately 1 year of treatment by various mechanisms, including gatekeeper mutations, alternative pathway activation and histological transformations. Because immunotherapy is an option for patients with drug-resistant cancers, we generated several TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines in vitro, and then evaluated the cytotoxicity of NK92-CD16 cells to these resistant  cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (H3122CR1, H3122LR1, H3122CR1LR1, PC-9GR, PC-9ER, EBC-CR1 and EBC-CR2) were established from NCI-H3122 (EML4-ALK fusion), PC-9 (EGFR exon19 deletion) and EBC-1 (MET amplification) after continuous exposure to crizotinib, ceritinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and capmatinib. Expression of ligands for natural killer (NK) cell receptors and total EGFR were analyzed using flow cytometry. NK cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab were measured using NK92-CD16 as effectors and detected  using the 51Chromium-release assay. RESULTS: We found that NK92-CD16 cells preferentially killed TKI-resistant NSCLC  cells when compared with their parental NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was up-regulated in the TKI-resistant  NSCLC cells and patients' tumors, and the ICAM-1 up-regulated cancer cells lines  were less susceptible to NK cytotoxicity by blocking ICAM-1. Moreover, NK92-CD16  cell-induced cytotoxicity toward TKI-resistant NSCLC cells was enhanced in the presence of cetuximab, an EGFR-targeting mAb. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that combinational treatment with NK cell-based immunotherapy and cetuximab may be promising for patients with TKI-resistant NSCLC."

[Epub ahead of print]"," Feasibility of liquid biopsy using plasma and platelets for detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements in non-small cell lung cancer.","PURPOSE: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using tumor tissue is the gold standard for detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, this method often is not repeatable  due to difficulties in the acquisition of tumor tissues. Blood-based liquid biopsy using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is expected to be useful to overcome this limitation. Here, we investigated the feasibility of liquid biopsy using plasma and platelets for detection of ALK rearrangement and prediction of ALK inhibitor treatment outcomes. METHODS: ALK-FISH assays were performed in 1128 tumor specimens of NSCLC between  January 2015 and June 2018. We retrospectively analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from previously confirmed FISH-positive (n = 199) and -negative (n = 920) cases. We recruited patients who had available  tissue specimens and agreed to venous sampling. RNA was extracted from FFPE blocks, plasma, and platelets. Fusion RNA of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK was detected by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Thirty-three FISH-positive and 28 FISH-negative patients were enrolled.  In validation, data compared with FISH, RT-PCR using FFPE tissues showed 54.5% sensitivity, 78.6% specificity, and 75.5% accuracy. Liquid biopsy had higher sensitivity (78.8%), specificity (89.3%) and accuracy (83.6%). Higher positivity  for liquid biopsy was shown in subgroups with delayed (≥ 6 months from diagnosis) blood sampling (plasma, 85.7%; platelets, 87.0%). In 26 patients treated with crizotinib, the platelet-positive subgroup showed longer median duration of treatment (7.2 versus 1.5 months), longer median progression-free survival (5.7 months versus 1.7 months), a higher overall response rate (70.6% versus 11.1%), and a higher disease control rate (88.2% versus 44.4%) than the platelet-negative subgroup. CONCLUSION: Liquid biopsy could have applications in the diagnosis of ALK-positive NSCLC, even when using RT-PCR, and platelets can be useful for predicting treatment outcomes of ALK inhibitors."

However, because such trials comprise cohorts selected based on specific criteria, it is unclear if their results represent routine clinical practice. METHODS: We examined 155 patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea between March 2014 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, EGFR/ALK mutation status, metastatic locations, response to ICIs, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years and 72.9% of patients were male; former or current smokers constituted 67.1% of the subjects. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (67.7%), and 50.3% of the patients underwent ≥ 2 previous treatments. Twenty-three patients (14.8%) were EGFR mutation- or ALK rearrangement-positive.  The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.4-31.4%]; the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.06 (95% CI 1.893-4.21) and 10.25 (95% CI 5.39-15.11) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG performance status, EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement status, liver metastasis and PD-L1 proportion as independent predictors of OS. Furthermore, 61.9% of the patients had adverse events of any grade; 38.1% had immune-related adverse events that were associated with PFS and  OS on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world ORR, PFS, OS, and adverse event profiles were comparable to previous clinical trials despite the patients' different baseline characteristics. Our findings can aid in establishing effective immunotherapeutic management of NSCLC in routine clinical practice."

Molecular determinants of response to lorlatinib have not been established, but preclinical data suggest that ALK resistance mutations may represent a biomarker of response in previously treated  patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline plasma and tumor tissue samples were collected from 198 patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer from the registrational phase II study of lorlatinib. We analyzed plasma DNA for ALK mutations using Guardant360. Tumor tissue DNA was analyzed using an ALK mutation-focused next-generation sequencing assay. Objective response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival were evaluated according to ALK mutation status. RESULTS: Approximately one quarter of patients had ALK mutations detected by plasma or tissue genotyping. In patients with crizotinib-resistant disease, the efficacy of lorlatinib was comparable among patients with and without ALK mutations using plasma or tissue genotyping. In contrast, in patients who had failed 1 or more second-generation ALK TKIs, objective response rate was higher among patients with ALK mutations (62% v 32% [plasma]; 69% v 27% [tissue]). Progression-free survival was similar in patients with and without ALK mutations  on the basis of plasma genotyping (median, 7.3 months v 5.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.81) but significantly longer in patients with ALK mutations identified by tissue genotyping (median, 11.0 months v 5.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.47). CONCLUSION: In patients who have failed 1 or more second-generation ALK TKIs, lorlatinib shows greater efficacy in patients with ALK mutations compared with patients without ALK mutations. Tumor genotyping for ALK mutations after failure  of a second-generation TKI may identify patients who are more likely to derive clinical benefit from lorlatinib."

Epub 2019 Apr 16."," Survival and prognostic factors in surgically treated brain metastases.","PURPOSE: While surgery and radiation remain the mainstays of therapy for all patients with brain metastases (BM), the management is moving to a more individualized approach based on the underlying tumor. We sought to identify prognostic factors of both intracranial progression (IC-PFS) and overall survival (OS) in a surgical cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1015 patients treated surgically for BM at Brigham and Women's Hospital (2007-2017). Kaplan-Meier curves were used for OS and IC-PFS and Cox proportional hazards models were built to assess for predictive factors. RESULTS: Common origins were lung (43.9%), breast (14.4%), and melanoma (13.8%).  Median OS for the cohort was 15.4 months (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 14.1-17.1). Breast cancer (22.1 months, 95%CI 17.8-30.3) and colorectal cancer (10.6 months, 95%CI 7.2-15.4) had the longest and shortest OS, respectively. On multivariable Cox regression, significant prognostic factors of shorter OS were age (HR 1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02), number of lesions (HR 1.56, 95%CI 1.28-1.89), extracranial spread at BM diagnosis (HR 1.26, 95%CI 1.05-1.52), and KPS (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.98-0.99). Regarding molecular factors, all driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma had a favorable effect (EGFR, HR 0.53, 95%CI 0.31-0.89; ALK, HR 0.28, 95%CI 0.12-0.66; KRAS, HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.47-0.92), triple negative status predicted poor prognosis in breast adenocarcinoma (HR 2.04, 95%CI 1.13-3.69), while no effect of BRAF/NRAS mutations was demonstrated in melanoma BMs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results corroborate the role of tumor origin and systemic as well as intracranial spread in OS. Heterogeneity within histologies was further explained by molecular alterations."

METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE search up to 1/30/18 using the keywords, alectinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, brigatinib, and lung cancer, resulting in a total  of 20 eligible cohorts with 2261 patients treated with ALK inhibitor monotherapy  for advanced NSCLC. The pooled incidences of all-grade, high-grade, and grade 5 pneumonitis were calculated. Subgroup analyses were conducted with meta-regression using study-level covariates. RESULTS: The overall pooled incidence of pneumonitis was 2.14% (95% CI: 1.37-3.34) for all grade, 1.33% (95% CI: 0.80-2.21) for high grade, and 0.22% (95% CI: 0.09-0.52) for grade 5 pneumonitis. The incidence was significantly higher in studies from Japan compared to studies of non-Japan origin, for all-grade (6.25% vs 1.14%, p < 0.001) and high-grade pneumonitis (3.31% vs 0.39%, p < 0.001). Multivariate meta-regression demonstrated the cohorts from Japanese studies had significantly higher odds of pneumonitis for all-grade (odds ratio [OR]: 4.329 [95% CI: 1.918, 9.770], p < 0.001) compared to those of non-Japan origin, after adjusting for types of ALK inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of ALK inhibitor pneumonitis was 2.14% in patients with advanced NSCLS. The patients from Japanese cohorts had a higher incidence of ALK-inhibitor pneumonitis, which indicates the need for increased awareness and caution for pneumonitis in Japanese patients treated with ALK inhibitors"

Patients with NSCLC harboring driver mutations who received ICIs (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) were reviewed in Hirosaki University and Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital. There were 139 patients who received molecular targeted drugs, including 24 patients treated with ICIs. Patient characteristics were as follows: Male/female, 5/19; median age 68 (range 39-82); smoking/non-smoking, 6/18; PS 0-1/2, 20/4; driver mutation status, EGFR/ALK/RET/ROS1: 21/1/1/1. The overall response rate was 16.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.0-37.1%] and the disease control rate was 33.4% (95%  CI, 18.9-55.1%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 62 days (95% CI 52-81 days). In the patients who had been treated by the preceding tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for >1 year, the PFS time was 110 days. On the other hand, in the patients who had received a TKI for less than a year, the PFS time was 56  days, which was significantly shorter (P=0.012). To conclude, some of the patients with NSCLC harboring driver mutation could benefit from ICIs, and the duration of previous TKI treatment may be associated with the efficacy."

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore the status of ALK in non-small-cell lung  cancer (NSCLC) specimens, to explore the relationships between ALK status and clinicopathological features and to identify genomic rearrangements via capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: We tested 9889 NSCLC specimens for ALK status using the Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) antibody. Clinicopathological features were analyzed and genomic rearrangements identified using capture-based NGS in 76 ALK-positive cases. RESULTS: In total, 485 specimens (4.90%) tested positive for ALK. The positivity  rate was higher for adenocarcinoma samples than for non-adenocarcinoma samples (6.03 vs. 1.47%; p < 0.001) and for biopsies/cell blocks than for surgical specimens (7.00 vs. 4.16%; p < 0.001). Patient age, patient sex, specimen type, specimen histotype, and patient smoking history were all significantly correlated with ALK status. Genomic rearrangements were detected in 98.68% (75/76) of the ALK-positive samples; 89.33% (67/75) carried the canonical EML4-ALK, and the remaining samples carried only noncanonical ALK rearrangements. Four of these noncanonical ALK fusion samples were identified as carrying EML4-ALK transcripts  at the RNA level. A novel fusion variant, SRD5A2-ALK, was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients with NSCLC, especially those aged < 30 years, were  more likely to test positive for ALK. Positive ALK test results were more common  in patients with invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and solid-predominant invasive  adenocarcinoma than in patients with other histotypes. Samples that carried only  noncanonical ALK rearrangements may also have carried the canonical EML4-ALK, which was not detected by capture-based NGS. EML4-ALK transcripts might result from rare splicing mechanisms without genomic rearrangements.","OBJECTIVE: Lung adenocarcinoma in young patients is a rare entity, and the targetable genomic alterations (GAs) are poorly studied. In other cancers, it has been demonstrated that young age defines unique disease biology. Here, the association of young age with GAs and prognosis is studied in a large cohort of Chinese patients. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 1000 consecutive patients, and identified 181 patients aged 40 years or younger. GAs were identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay. The clinical and genetic characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Among younger group, 167(92.3%) patients were diagnosed with advanced-stage adenocarcinoma, 98(54.1%) were female, 27(14.9%) were smokers, and the median age was 35 years. Targetable GAs which were significantly more common  in the younger population (P <  0.001), were associated with young age (P < 0.05). The frequency of ALK translocations, EGFR and KRAS mutations was 37.6%, 34.3% and 6.1%, respectively. Younger patients had a higher prevalence of rare GAs including HER2, ROS1 and MET (P < 0.05). Prognosis for younger patients was similar (median OS of patients with GAs, 23.91 vs 23.67 months, P >  0.05) or better than that for older population (median OS of patients without GAs, 44.28 vs 41.88 months, P <  0.05) according to GAs. Therapy modality was an independent prognostic factor (P <  0.05), and 83% of death rate decreased if given preferred therapy. CONCLUSION: Younger patients with lung adenocarcinoma had unique prevalence of targetable GAs. Comprehensive genotyping including NGS is recommended for personalized therapy and prognosis evaluation in this population."

Real-world research data are needed as further evidence. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study to explore how crizotinib affects the control of brain metastasis and the survival outcomes among Chinese patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of unselected ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib at five hospitals in China  from January 1, 2013 to November 30, 2017. Patients developing brain metastasis either before or during crizotinib treatment were included. Survival outcomes were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients were included in the analysis; 95 of these patients had baseline brain metastasis, while 79 patients developed brain metastasis during crizotinib treatment. Among patients with baseline brain metastasis, the median intracranial time to progression was 19.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.5-26.2) and the median overall survival (OS) was 53.4 months (95% CI not reached). A total of 135 patients experienced intracranial progression, and 94 of these patients continued crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD). There was no significant difference in the median OS  between patients with CBPD and without CBPD (48.3 months vs 53.4 months; p = 0.296). CONCLUSIONS: ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC patients with baseline brain metastasis can still achieve OS benefits from crizotinib treatment. However, patients with intracranial progression may not obtain a long-term survival benefit from continuation of CBPD."

Crizotinib, an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), MET, and ROS1, has shown marked antitumor activity in patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyze the efficacy and safety of crizotinib treatment in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement in real-world clinical practice. METHODS: We included 35 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC in this retrospective analysis. All received crizotinib 250 mg twice daily between March 2016 and April 2018 at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. All had histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangements, which were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or next-generation sequencing. The main outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival  (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 51.0 years; 23 (65.7%) were female and 28 (80.0%) were never smokers. All were diagnosed as having adenocarcinoma; eight patients (22.9%) had brain metastases at baseline. The ORR and DCR were 71.4% and 94.3%, respectively. The estimated median PFS was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.8-14.2). The estimated median OS was 41.0 months (95%  CI 22.5-59.5). Elevated transaminases (54.3%), vision disorder (25.7%), elevated  blood creatinine (22.9%), diarrhea (20.0%), and vomiting (20.0%) were the most commonly reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Crizotinib was effective and well tolerated in Chinese patients with  ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC in real-world clinical practice. The progression sites and patterns, as well as treatments after first disease progression on crizotinib were diverse. Crizotinib beyond progressive disease and local therapy  after failure of crizotinib treatment were feasible and effective in clinical practice."

Although TC2N has proven to be an oncogene in lung cancer, its biological function and molecular mechanisms in other cancer still remains unclear. Here, we investigate in breast cancer that TC2N expression is sharply overexpressed in breast cancer specimens compared with normal breast specimens, and the low TC2N expression was associated with advanced stage, lymphatic metastasis, larger tumors and shorter survival time. Upregulation of TC2N significantly restrains breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, TC2N blocks AKT signaling in a PI3K dependent and independent way through weakening the interaction between ALK and p55γ or inhibiting the binding of EBP1 and AKT. To sum up, these results unmask an ambivalent role of TC2N in cancer, providing a promising inhibitor for PI3K-AKT signaling."

Furthermore, biomarkers identified from gene analysis can be used to detect early lung cancer, determine patient prognosis, and monitor response to therapy. In the present study we analyzed the molecular profile of seventy-three Tunisian patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). Mutational analyses for EGFR and KRAS were performed using direct sequencing, immunohistochemistry or MassARRAY. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the D5F3 clone, and p53 expression was also assessed. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 61 years (range 23-82 years). Using different methodologies, EGFR mutations were found in 5.47% of patients and only exon 19 deletions E746-A750 del were detected. KRAS mutations were present in 9.58% of cases, while only one patient was ALK-positive. Moreover, abnormal immunostaining of p53 was detected in 56.16% of patients. In conclusion, the detected rates of EGFR and KRAS mutation and ALK rearrangement were lower than those found in European and Asian  countries, whereas, abnormal p53 expression was slightly more frequent. Furthermore, given the small sample size of this study, a more comprehensive analysis of this patient set is warranted."

[Epub ahead of print]"," Amplifying Outcomes: Checkpoint Inhibitor Combinations in First-Line Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","PURPOSE: Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, resulting in approximately 1.8 million deaths worldwide. Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors has become standard of care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and there is increasing interest in further improving outcomes through combination with other therapeutics. This systematic review evaluates emerging phase III data on the efficacy and safety of checkpoint inhibitor combinations as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published and presented literature was searched using the  key search terms non-small cell lung cancer AND checkpoint-inhibitors (OR respective aliases) AND phase III trials. Seven randomized phase III clinical trials reporting outcomes on checkpoint inhibitor combinations in first-line advanced NSCLC were identified. RESULTS: Four first-line trials reported outcomes for checkpoint inhibitor combinations in nonsquamous NSCLC. Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy, atezolizumab-chemotherapy, and atezolizumab-bevacizumab-chemotherapy showed significantly improved overall survival compared with controls in patients with advanced nonsquamous epidermal growth factor receptor-negative (EGFR-)/ anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK)- NSCLC. Two trials reported outcomes for squamous NSCLC, with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy reporting significantly improved  overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy. The combination of nivolumab-ipilimumab in all-comer histology failed to improve OS compared with histology appropriate chemotherapy in patients regardless of their tumor mutational burden status. Based on improved survival and safety, either pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab-chemotherapy administered based on PD-L1 status and histology is a preferred treatment option. Outcomes for atezolizumab-bevacizumab-chemotherapy in EGFR+/ALK+ patients are promising and require further exploration. CONCLUSION: First-line checkpoint inhibitors added to standard therapies improve  overall survival for nonsquamous EGFR-/ALK- and squamous advanced NSCLC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors are now standard of care for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and emerging data show that combining these agents with established chemotherapy further improves outcomes. The phase III KEYNOTE-189 and IMPower-130 trials showed significantly improved survival using this strategy for nonsquamous NSCLC, and the phase III KEYNOTE-407 trial showed similar results in squamous disease. Checkpoint inhibitor combinations are therefore an important new treatment option for first-line NSCLC. Programmed death ligand-1 expression may inform the use of  checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy, and overall tumor mutation burden is also an emerging biomarker for this new treatment strategy."

The activity of ICI across NSCLC harboring oncogenic alterations is poorly characterized. The aim of our study was to address the efficacy of ICI in the context of oncogenic addiction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study for patients receiving ICI monotherapy for advanced NSCLC with at least one oncogenic driver alteration. Anonymized data were evaluated for clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes for ICI therapy: best response (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and  overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was PFS under ICI. Secondary endpoints were best response (RECIST 1.1) and overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. RESULTS: We studied 551 patients treated in 24 centers from 10 countries. The molecular alterations involved KRAS (n = 271), EGFR (n = 125), BRAF (n = 43), MET (n = 36), HER2 (n = 29), ALK (n = 23), RET (n = 16), ROS1 (n = 7), and multiple drivers (n = 1). Median age was 60 years, gender-ratio was 1:1, never/former/current smokers were 28/51/21% respectively, and the majority of tumors were adenocarcinoma. The objective response rate by driver alteration was: KRAS=26%, BRAF=24%, ROS1=17%, MET=16%, EGFR=12%, HER2=7%, RET=6%, ALK=0%. In the  entire cohort, median PFS was 2.8 months, OS 13.3 months and the best response rate 19%. In a subgroup analysis, median PFS (in months) was 2.1 for EGFR, 3.2 for KRAS, 2.5 for ALK, 3.1 for BRAF, 2.5 for HER2, 2.1 for RET, and 3.4 for MET.  In certain subgroups, PFS was positively associated with PD-L1 expression (KRAS,  EGFR) and with smoking status (BRAF, HER2). CONCLUSIONS: ICI induced regression in some tumors with actionable driver alterations, but clinical activity was lower compared to the KRAS group and the lack of response in the ALK group was notable. Patients with actionable tumor alterations should receive targeted therapies and chemotherapy before considering immunotherapy."

The combined results of two clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of entrectinib in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. Because the development of drug resistance is inevitable, it would be helpful to determine the mechanisms of entrectinib resistance in a ROS1-rearranged tumor model so that future therapeutic strategies can be developed. Here, we characterized the molecular basis of resistance in entrectinib-resistant ROS1-rearranged HCC78 cells (HCC78ER cells). These cells were analyzed by next-generation sequencing and genetic profiling, which revealed the acquisition of KRAS G12C and the amplification of KRAS and FGF3. However, there were no secondary mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain. We also found that sustained ERK activation was involved in entrectinib resistance, and that combined treatment with selumetinib resensitized HCC78ER cells to entrectinib in cell viability and colony formation assays. Our data suggest that activation of the RAS signaling pathway can cause entrectinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, and is unlikely to be overcome by sequential single agent ROS1-targeting strategies against such tumors. Instead, co-targeting ROS1 and MEK may be an effective strategy for overcoming entrectinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC."

Alterations of these two genes were traditionally considered to be mutually exclusive, but recent studies have suggested that they  can occur concomitantly. Here, we investigated the prevalence, clinical features  and outcomes in response to the treatment of NSCLC patients who harbor EGFR and ALK co-alterations. Methods: We reviewed the genomic profiles of 419 ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients with the intent of investigating the EGFR kinase domain (exon 18-21) and ALK co-alterations. The genomes of these patients were sequenced in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory. Results: The overall frequency of concomitant EGFR (exon 18-21) and ALK alterations was 5.01% (21/419) in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. The concomitant  rate of EGFR alterations in patients with EML4-ALK co-alterations (3.06%, 11/359) was dramatically lower than that in patients with non-EML4-ALK co-alterations (16.67%, 10/60, p<0.01). EML4-ALK/EGF R co-alterations were more prone to occur in females than in males, and non-EML4-ALK/EGFR co-alterations were more common in males than in females (p=0.02). Before the detection of EGFR-ALK co-alterations, some patients were treated with EGFR-TKIs (n=16) according to previously detected EGFR alterations; Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that EML4-ALK/EGFR co-altered patients (n=7) had a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) after EGFR-TKI treatment than that of non-EML4-ALK/EGFR co-altered patients (n=8; mPFS, 6.0 vs 15.0 months, p=0.046). In addition, we demonstrated the subsequent clinical outcomes of co-altered patients after previous EGFR-TKI treatment. Five EGFR/ALK co-altered patients treated with single TKIs (EGFR-TKIs or ALK-TKIs) displayed diverse clinical outcomes. Three patients who received dual-TKI treatment (EGFR-TKI plus ALK-TKI)  all achieved a PFS of more than 5 months (8.4 months, 8.6 months, >5.2 months). Conclusion: EML4-ALK/EGFR and non-EML4-ALK/EGFR co-alterations displayed distinct clinical features and responses to EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that non-EML4-ALK co-alterations are likely to occur as a resistance mechanism to EGFR-TKI. In addition, dual-TKI therapy might be a better choice than single-TKI treatments for these co-altered patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest  dual-positive EGFR/ALK cohort study in People's Republic of China."

Moreover, in the evaluations of Blood Brain Barrier, Human Intestinal Absorption, AMES toxicity, and LD50 the virtual screened compound (PubChem CID- 123449015)was found within high optimization. CONCLUSION: These investigations denotes that virtual screened compound (PubChem  CID- 123449015) is more efficient to be a better prospective candidate for NSCLC  treatment having good pharmacological profile than the pre-established compound CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) with low rerank score. The identified virtual screened drug have a high potential to act as ALK inhibitors and can show promising results in the research of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."

INTRODUCTION: Several studies have suggested that non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement might  have different imaging features compared with those without the rearrangement. The goal of this work was to systematically investigate the computed tomography (CT) imaging features of ALK-rearranged NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched published studies that investigated CT imaging features of ALK-rearranged NSCLC compared with ALK-negative, including epidermal  growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant and ALK/EGFR-negative, NSCLC. We extracted clinicopathologic characteristics and CT imaging features of patients in the included studies. Features were compared and tested in the form of odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences at a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Twelve studies with 2210 patients with NSCLC were included. Compared with ALK-negative NSCLC, ALK-rearranged NSCLC was more likely to be solid (OR, 2.37; P < .001) and less likely to have cavitation (OR, 0.45; P = .002). In advanced stages, patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, compared with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, were more likely to have lymphadenopathy (OR, 3.47; P < .001), pericardial metastasis (OR, 2.18; P = .04), pleural metastasis (OR, 2.07; P = .004), and lymphangitic carcinomatosis (OR, 3.41; P = .02), but less likely to have lung metastasis (OR, 0.52; P = .003). Compared with ALK/EGFR-negative NSCLC, ALK-rearranged NSCLC was more likely to have lymphangitic carcinomatosis (OR, 3.88; P = .03), pleural metastasis (OR, 1.89; P = .02), and pleural effusion (OR, 2.94; P = .003). CONCLUSION: ALK-rearranged NSCLC has imaging features that are different compared with EGFR-mutant and ALK/EGFR-negative NSCLC. These imaging features might provide clues as to the presence of ALK rearrangement and help in the selection of patients who might benefit from expedited molecular testing or repeat testing  after a negative assay"

Here, we characterized the fusion gene, VAPA-Rab31, discovered from RNA-sequencing data of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who did not harbor activating mutations in EGFR, KRAS and ALK. This fusion gene encodes a protein comprising the N-terminal region of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) fused to the C-terminal region of Ras-related protein 31 (Rab31). Exogenous expression of  VAPA-Rab31 in immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated the potential transforming effects of this fusion gene, including increased colony formation and cell proliferation in vitro. Also, enhanced tumorigenicity upon VAPA-Rab31 was confirmed in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Metastatic tumors were also detected in the liver and lungs of xenografted mice. Overexpression of  VAPA-Rab31 upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and phosphorylated CREB both  in cells and xenograft tumors. Reduced apoptosis and increased phosphorylation of CREB and Erk were observed in VAPA-Rab31-overexpressing cells after bortezomib treatment. Elevated Bcl-2 level via activated CREB contributed to the resistance  to the bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest the oncogenic function of the novel fusion gene VAPA-Rab31 via upregulated Bcl-2 and activated CREB in lung cancer."

RESULTS: In total 42 EGFR mutations (40.8%), 3 ALK fusions (3.9%), 6 KRAS mutations (5.8%), 3 PIK3CA mutations and amplifications (2.9%), 1 MET exon 14-skipping (1%) and 1 RET fusion (1%) were detected. The occurrence of mutations have varied with sample types and pathological types. Seventeen out of 20 EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-treated patients with EGFR mutations have shown remission. CONCLUSION: The mutational frequency of NSCLCs among Chinese patients slightly differed from the western populations, in particular the frequency of ALK fusion. The mutations have well correlated with clinical response to targeted therapy."

At present, three or more generations of ALK inhibitors have been used for ALK-positive NSCLC treatment, including crizotinib, alectinib, ceritinib, and brigatinib. Although most adverse events (AEs) of ALK inhibitors are grades 1 to 2 and generally can be well tolerated, serious adverse events (SAEs) of ALK inhibitors lack data analysis, and the lung  toxicity of ALK inhibitors needs attention. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the safety of ALK inhibitors, especially in terms of drug-related SAEs. Methods: A total of 19 studies from 4 databases (PubMed, Science Direct, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Library) were included in this meta-analysis. All statistical analyses in this meta-analysis were performed with the STATA 14.0 software. We analyzed the incidences of total AEs, total SAEs and SAEs for different ALK inhibitors. Results: AEs of the ALK inhibitors occurred in almost all participants, and SAEs occurred in more than 20% of the participants. For ceritinib and brigatinib, SAEs occurred in more than 40% of the participants. Alectinib is most likely the safest of the two generations of ALK inhibitors. Generally, the ALK inhibitors showed significant lung toxicity. Conclusion: In conclusion, attention should be focused on ALK inhibitor-related SAEs, especially lung toxicity. According to this meta-analysis, alxectinib seems to be the safest ALK inhibitor. Physicians should focus on the related SAEs when prescribing ALK inhibitors."

BACKGROUND: First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy improves overall and progression-free survival in patients with untreated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50% or greater. We investigated overall survival after treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without a sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, life expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. Randomisation was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of  world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (≥50% vs 1-49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every  3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0·0122, p=0·0120, and p=0·0124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the  previous findings were significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894. FINDINGS: From Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of 20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up  was 12·8 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (≥50% hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI 0·56-0·85, p=0·0003; ≥20% 0·77, 0·64-0·92, p=0·0020, and ≥1% 0·81, 0·71-0·93, p=0·0018). The median surival values by TPS population were 20·0 months (95% CI 15·4-24·9) for pembrolizumab versus 12·2 months (10·4-14·2) for chemotherapy, 17·7 months (15·3-22·1) versus 13·0 months (11·6-15·3), and 16·7 months (13·9-19·7) versus 12·1 months (11·3-13·3), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of 636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.

Research is ongoing to expand the number of drug targets that can offer clinically meaningful outcomes.  Rearranged during transfection (RET) fusions are the latest oncogenic driver alterations that show potential as a drug target. RET fusions occur in 1-2% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. They are more commonly associated with  younger age, female gender, non-smokers and Asian ethnicity. The RET kinase is abnormally activated through fusion with a partner protein such as KIF5B, CCDC6 or NCOA4. This leads to downstream intracellular signalling and enhancement of gene transcription and cell proliferation. The effectiveness of multi-kinase inhibitors in RET positive NSCLC has been explored in early phase and retrospective studies. From these studies, the most effective agents identified include cabozantanib and vandetanib. Overall response rates (ORR) vary from 18-47% across studies. In general, these agents have a manageable toxicity profile, although there are a number of off-target toxicities. Similar to the increased activity in ALK rearranged disease, pemetrexed has demonstrated superior response rates in this patient group and should be considered. Selective RET inhibitors, including LOXO-292 and BLU-667, are progressing in clinical trials. LOXO-292 has demonstrated an impressive ORR of 77% in RET positive solid  tumours. It is anticipated this agent will be an effective targeted therapeutic option for patients with RET positive lung cancer."

Several molecular alterations have been described in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mainly in nonsmokers, with no risk factors identified. We studied the role of indoor radon in NSCLC patients harboring specific driver alterations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the radon concentration from EGFR-, BRAF-mutated (m), and ALK-rearranged (r) NSCLC patients measured by an alpha-track detector placed in their homes between September 2014 and August 2015. Clinical characteristics were collected prospectively, and pathologic samples were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included (36 EGFRm, 10 ALKr, 2 BRAFm). Median  radon concentration was 104 Bq/m³ (IQR 69-160) overall, and was 96 Bq/m³ (42-915) for EGFRm, 116 (64-852) for ALKr, and 125 for BRAFm, with no significant differences. Twenty-seven patients (56%) had indoor radon above WHO recommendations, 8 (80%) of 10 ALKr, 2 (100%) of 2 BRAFm, and 17 (47%) of 36 EGFRm. CONCLUSION: The median indoor radon concentration was above the WHO recommendations, with no differences between EGFR, ALK, and BRAF patients. Concentrations above the WHO recommendations were most common with ALKr and BRAFm. These findings should be validated in larger studies."

While this is definitely a major therapeutic success for thoracic oncology, it may not be entirely attributable to rapid drug development and the strenuous clinical efforts. At the genetic level,  ALK+ disease is also unique, distinguished by the lowest tumor mutational burden  (mean below 3 mutations/Mbp), the lowest frequency of TP53 mutations (20-25%) and very few other co-mutations compared to other NSCLC. The relative simplicity and  stability of the genetic landscape not only contribute to the relatively favourable clinical course, but also make study of the effects from individual molecular features easier. EML4-ALK fusion variant 3 (E6;A20) and TP53 mutations  were recently identified as main molecular determinants of adverse outcome: they  occur in about 30-40% and 20-25% of newly-diagnosed cases, respectively, have possibly synergistic effects and are independently associated with more aggressive disease, shorter progression-free survival under treatment with ALK inhibitors and worse overall survival. Secondary detection of TP53 mutations at disease progression in previously negative patients defines another subset (about 20%) with similarly poor outcome, while detection of ALK resistance mutations guides next-line therapy. As our biological understanding deepens, additional molecular risk factors will be identified and refine our concepts further. The translation of clinical risk at the molecular level and the ability to predict early events are of key importance for individualized patient management and preclinical modeling in order to advance therapeutic options."

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the clinical outcomes and costs of alectinib and crizotinib, which included five health states: progression-free  (PF) without central nervous system (CNS) progression, PF with CNS progression, post-progression (PP) without CNS progression, PP with CNS progression, and death. Clinical data for transition probabilities were obtained from the ALEX trial at the updated data cutoff. Healthcare resource utilization and costs were  derived from clinical expert opinions and published literature. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the results. Scenario analyses were conducted including using clinical data from the ALESIA trial in Asian patients, using utilities from the ALEX trial, and choosing different parametric survival models. RESULTS: In base case analysis, alectinib yielded an additional 1.04 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with incremental costs of $54,827, resulting  in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $52,869/QALY. In scenario analysis, the ICER was $56,787/QALY using clinical data from the ALESIA trial. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probabilities of alectinib being cost-effective were 0.4% and 43.7% when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds were $28,109/QALY and $50,000/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSION: Alectinib could prolong the mean time of PF and delay the time to CNS progression. However, because of its high drug cost, alectinib was unlikely to be cost-effective for untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients in China."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 18 randomized clinical trials of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC), initiated after 2007 and submitted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration. TTD was calculated as date of randomization to date of discontinuation or death and compared to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) across all patients, as well as in treatment-defined subgroups [EGFR mutation-positive treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), EGFR wild-type treated with TKI, ALK-positive treated with TKI, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), chemotherapy doublet with maintenance, chemotherapy monotherapy]. RESULTS: Overall across 8947 patients, TTD was more closely associated with PFS (r = 0.87, 95% CI 0.86-0.87) than with OS (0.68, 95% CI 0.67-0.69). Early TTD (PFS-TTD ≥ 3 months) occurred in 7.7% of patients overall, and was more common with chemo monotherapy (15.0%) while late TTD (TTD-PFS ≥ 3 months) occurred in 6.0% of patients overall, and was more common in EGFR-positive and ALK-positive patients (12.4% and 22.9%). In oncogene-targeted subgroups (EGFR positive and ALK positive), median TTDs (13.4 and 14.1 months) exceeded median PFS (11.4 and 11.3 months). CONCLUSIONS: At the patient level, TTD is associated with PFS across therapeutic  classes. Median TTD exceeds median PFS for biomarker-selected patients receiving  oncogene-targeted therapies. TTD should be prospectively studied further as an end point for pragmatic randomized RWE trials only for continuously administered  therapies.

In tumors where the full-length ALK RTK itself is mutated, such as neuroblastoma, the picture regarding the role of ALK as an oncogenic driver is less clear. Neuroblastoma is a complex and heterogeneous tumor that arises from the neural crest derived peripheral nervous system. Although high-risk neuroblastoma is rare, it often relapses and becomes refractory to treatment. Thus, neuroblastoma accounts for 10-15% of all childhood cancer deaths. Since most cases are in children under the age of 2, understanding the role and regulation of ALK during neural crest development is an important goal in addressing neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. An impressive array of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that act to inhibit ALK have been FDA approved for use in ALK-driven cancers. ALK TKIs bind differently within the ATP-binding pocket of the ALK kinase domain and have been associated with different resistance mutations within ALK itself that arise in response to therapeutic use, particularly in ALK-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This patient population has highlighted the importance of considering the relevant ALK TKI to be used for a given ALK mutant variant. In this review, we discuss ALK in  neuroblastoma, as well as the use of ALK TKIs and other strategies to inhibit tumor growth. Current efforts combining novel approaches and increasing our understanding of the oncogenic role of ALK in neuroblastoma are aimed at improving the efficacy of ALK TKIs as precision medicine options in the clinic."

In  particular, robust IHC assays performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue are widely used as surrogate markers for ALK and ROS1 rearrangements and for detecting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in  patients with advanced NSCLC; in addition, they have become essential for treatment decisions. Cytology samples represent the only source of tumor in a significant proportion of patients with inoperable NSCLC, and there is increasing demand for predictive biomarker testing on them. However, the wide variation in the types of cytology samples and their preparatory methods, the use of alcohol-based fixatives that interfere with immunochemistry results, the difficulty in procurement of cytology-specific controls, and the uncertainty regarding test validity have resulted in underutilization of cytology material for predictive immunocytochemistry (ICC), and most cytopathologists limit such testing to FFPE cell blocks (CBs). The purpose of this review is to: 1) analyze various preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical factors influencing ICC results; 2) discuss measures for validation of ICC protocols; and 3) summarize published data on predictive ICC for ALK, ROS1, EGFR gene alterations and PD-L1 expression on lung cancer cytology. Based on our experience and from a review of  the literature, we conclude that cytology specimens are in principal suitable for predictive ICC, but proper optimization and rigorous quality control for high-quality staining are essential, particularly for non-CB preparations."

Of note, the presence of both negative PD-L1 expression and low TMB may identify a subgroup of patients who has little benefit from immunotherapy combinations and for whom the best treatment option may still be platinum-based chemotherapy. To date, first-line single agent immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated limited activity in EGFR mutated NSCLC and the combination of immunotherapy and targeted agents has raised safety concerns in both EGFR and ALK positive NSCLC patients.

For the remaining patients, an immunotherapy-based regimen alone or in combination with chemotherapy is now the  preferred option based on high-level evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials and in accordance with all available guidelines. Deciding between therapeutic options can be difficult due to the lack of direct cross-comparison studies, differences in chemotherapies and stratification factors, and differences in study populations resulting from inclusion criteria such as histology, PD-L1 expression, or tumor mutational burden (TMB).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study was a single-institution study conducted on patients with unresectable stage III non-squamous NSCLC treated by definitive chemoradiotherapy between January 2006 and March 2016. Only patients with information of EGFR mutations and/or ALK translocation were included. The prognosis and initial recurrence patterns were compared according to the presence/absence of EGFR mutation and/or ALK translocation. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients (34 with activating EGFR mutations, 13 who were  positive for ALK translocation) were enrolled, and the median follow-up duration  was 36 months (range, 3-123 months). The 3-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in the EGFR-mutant group than in the wild-type EGFR group (75% vs. 46%; P = .002). There was a tendency towards a better overall survival in the ALK-positive group than in the ALK-negative group (68% vs. 44%; P = .085). No differences in the 3-year progression-free survival were observed according to the EGFR or ALK status. The EGFR-mutant group showed a significantly lower rate of in-field failure (P = .027) and higher rate of out-of-field failure (P = .029) as compared with the wild-type EGFR group. There was no significant difference in the rate of in-field failure or out-of-field failure between the ALK-positive and ALK-negative groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although the ALK-positive group showed no characteristic failure pattern, the EGFR-mutant group showed a lower rate of in-field failure and higher rate of out-of-field failure."

The primary objective of this phase 1 study (NCT01553656) was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of cabozantinib in Japanese patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled at 2 sites in Japan. After determining the MTD and RP2D, an expansion in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consisting of 3 molecularly defined cohorts (EGFR mutation; KRAS mutation; ALK, RET, or ROS1 fusion) was initiated. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01553656). RESULTS: Forty-three Japanese patients were enrolled (dose escalation, n = 23; NSCLC expansion, n = 20). The MTD of cabozantinib capsules was 60 mg daily, and the RP2D of cabozantinib tablets was 60 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were hypertension, proteinuria, and venous embolism. Safety and pharmacokinetics in Japanese patients were consistent with those in non-Japanese patients. Common adverse events included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, hypertension, and diarrhea. Reduction in tumor lesion size was observed in multiple tumor types in  the dose-escalation cohorts, with partial responses observed in 4 of 9 patients with NSCLC (EGFR mutation, n = 1; ALK fusion, n = 2; and RET fusion, n = 1). In the NSCLC expansion, 4 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC had partial responses; the remaining 16 (EGFR mutation, n = 11; KRAS mutation, n = 2; ALK fusion, n = 1; and RET fusion, n = 2) had stable disease as best response. CONCLUSION: Cabozantinib had a manageable safety profile in Japanese patients with solid tumors. Responses were observed in diverse molecular subtypes of NSCLC."

Lorlatinib, a novel third-generation TKI, produced remarkable results from the first-in-man phase 1 trial: an overall response rate of 46% and 50% for previously treated ALK- and ROS1-positive patients, respectively. However, the efficacy of lorlatinib has not been widely validated in Asian patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC with ALK or ROS1 rearrangements who initiated lorlatinib therapy between November 2016 and July 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Twelve consecutive patients were included. The median age was 55 years (range, 36-76 years). Ten (83%) had ALK-positive NSCLC and 2 (17%) had ROS1-positive NSCLC. All patients had a history of first- or second-generation ALK TKI receipt. Two ALK-positive patients and one ROS1-positive patient had the  G1202R and G2032R mutations, respectively. The overall response rate was 64% and  the disease control rate was 91%. Of the 3 ALK-positive patients with intracranial target lesions, 1 (33%) had a complete response and 2 (67%) a partial response, producing an intracranial objective response of 100%. The median progression-free survival was 6.5 months (range, 1.0-16.5 months). The most common adverse event was hypercholesterolemia (83%), and no adverse event-related dose reductions or treatment discontinuations were reported. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report that lorlatinib is an important novel therapeutic option for Asian patients who have advanced NSCLC harboring ALK/ROS1 mutations whose disease progressed during treatment with first- and second-generation TKIs."

In this review, we focus on the different aspects of the treatment of oncogene-driven NSCLC. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with an EGFR or ALK alteration show a better clinical outcome with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment compared to chemotherapy.Patients with a ROS1 rearrangement or a BRAF V600E mutation show favorable clinical outcome with TKI treatment compared to chemotherapy, although  randomized trials are not available.Patients on TKIs will eventually develop disease progression because of acquired resistance.The treatment with immunotherapy in EGFR and ALK-positive NSCLC patients did not improve overall survival over that of chemotherapy.Blood-based genetic analysis provides the opportunity to noninvasively screen patients for the presence of oncogenic drivers and to monitor resistance during TKI treatment. SUMMARY: Targeted molecular therapies are now standard of care for patients with  oncogene-driven NSCLC with a good clinical benefit and minimal toxicity. The role of immunotherapy in patients with molecular alterations is still unclear. Blood-based genotyping has gained interest in the diagnostic and resistance monitoring setting for patients with NSCLC."

There are many cases of lung cancer in which surgery cannot be performed, and such cases require diagnosis by  cytological specimen or biopsy. Estimating ALK (+) lung cancer from cytomorphology would allow molecular testing to proceed without the waste of a small amount of specimen. The purpose of this study was to assess whether qualitative and quantitative cytomorphological features are sufficient for distinguishing primary ALK (+) from ALK (-) lung cancer. METHODS: We examined eight qualitative cytomorphological parameters and three quantitative nuclear morphometric parameters in 17 cases of primary ALK (+) lung  cancer, diagnosed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using histological specimens, and in 41 cases of ALK (-) lung cancer. Quantitative nuclear morphometric parameters were analysed by a computer-assisted image analysis system. RESULTS: In ALK (+) lung cancer, three qualitative parameters (signet ring cells, nuclear grooves and single type nucleoli) and two quantitative parameters (large  nuclear area and irregular nuclear shape) were observed in significantly higher proportions. However, in ALK (-) lung cancer, one qualitative parameter (unclear  and multiple type nucleoli) was seen significantly more often. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the cytomorphological features of signet ring cells, nuclear grooves and nucleoli shape can help to triage a small amount  of cytological and biopsy specimens for appropriate molecular testing of primary  ALK (+) lung cancer."

The aim  of this prospective-retrospective cohort study was to obtain real-world data on the use of crizotinib or chemotherapy in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in Russia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-negative metastatic NSCLC were screened in 23 cancer centers. To be eligible, patients were required to have confirmation of ALK rearrangement. Patients were treated with crizotinib (250 mg twice daily; n = 96) or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 53). The primary end point was OS. RESULTS: A total of 149 ALK-positive patients were included. Mean age was 53 years in both groups. Patients were predominately women (59%) and never-smokers (74%), and most patients had adenocarcinoma histology (95%). At a median follow-up time of 15 months, 79 of the 149 patients included in the analysis had  died. Median OS from the start of treatment was 31 months (95% CI, 28.5 to 33.5 months) in the crizotinib group and 15.0 months (95% CI, 9.0 to 21.0 months) in the chemotherapy group (P < .001). The objective response rate was 34% in the crizotinib group. Among patients with brain metastasis, one complete response (6%) and five partial responses (31%) were achieved. Grade 3 adverse events were  observed in three patients (3%) in the crizotinib group. CONCLUSION: The improved OS observed in crizotinib clinical trials in ALK-positive NSCLC was also observed in the less selective patient populations treated in daily practice in Russia. The use of standard chemotherapy in these patients remains common but seems inappropriate as a result of the effectiveness  of newer treatments, such as crizotinib."

Since 2011, several small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. The objective of this study was to measure the impact of copay assistance on patient cost sharing and treatment patterns in patients prescribed  oral ALK inhibitors (ALKi's). METHODS: Patterns of claims approval/rejection and payment/reversal, out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, and treatment persistence were reported for patients identified in the IQVIA Formulary Impact Analyzer database from January 2013 to August 2017 linked to a medical claims database. The primary study cohorts were patients with copay assistance, including manufacturer's copay cards, other discount cards, or free-trial vouchers, on the index ALKi claim, and patients without copay assistance at any time during the follow-up period. RESULTS: In total, 3,143 patients were included in analyses related to claim patterns, and 1,685 patients were included in analyses related to treatment persistence. Copay assistance decreased the OOP cost for the first approved ALKi  by $1,930, on average. Patients with copay assistance picked up ALKi prescriptions from the pharmacy sooner than patients without copay assistance (2.6 days vs 25.7 days). In adjusted analyses, patients with copay assistance had 88.2% lower risk of abandoning their first approved prescription and 24.3% lower  risk of discontinuing treatment with the first observed ALKi (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Copay assistance reduced the patient cost burden for ALKi's and was associated with patients picking up their ALKi prescriptions, beginning ALKi treatment sooner, and remaining on treatment."

LMs were more frequent in driver gene-mutated patients, and cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF) cell-free DNA has shown unique genetic profiles of LM in EGFR-mutated LM. However, studies in patients with ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK)-rearranged NSCLC with LMs are scarce. METHODS: Patients with lung cancer with ALK rearrangement were screened from September 2011 to February 2018 at our institute. CSF and paired plasma were tested by next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: LMs were diagnosed in 30 (10.3%) of 291 patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer. A total of 11 paired CSF and plasma samples tested by next-generation sequencing were analyzed. Driver genes were detected in 81.8% of  the CSF samples (9 of 11) and 45.5% of the plasma samples (5 of 11) (p = 0.183).  The maximum allelic fractions were all higher in CSF than in plasma (p = 0.009).  ALK and tumor protein p53 gene (TP53) were the two most frequently mutated genes  in CSF. Gatekeeper gene ALK G1202R and C1156F mutations were identified in CSF after resistance to alectinib. Multiple copy number variants were mainly found in CSF, including in EGFR, cyclin D1 gene (CCND1), fibroblast growth factor 3 gene (FGF3), and fibroblast growth factor 4 gene (FGF4). Also found were v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog gene (MYC) copy number gains and TP53 and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene (CDKN2A) copy number deletions. Brigatinib seemed to be effective in controlling LM. One case showed that CSF could be used to monitor disease development of LM and longitudinally monitor tumor response. CONCLUSION: Liquid biopsy of CSF is more sensitive than liquid biopsy of plasma to detect targetable alterations, characterizing resistance mechanisms on progression and monitoring tumor response in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC with LM. Thus, CSF might be promising as a medium of liquid biopsy in LM."

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in a predominantly Chinese patient population with previously treated NSCLC. METHODS: CheckMate 078 was a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial in  patients from China, Russia, and Singapore with squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC that had progressed during/after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02613507). Patients with EGFR/ALK alterations were excluded. Patients (N = 504) were randomized 2:1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks), stratified by performance status, tumor histology, and tumor programmed death ligand 1 expression. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included objective response rate, progression-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: OS was significantly improved with nivolumab (n = 338) versus docetaxel  (n = 166); median OS (95% confidence interval): 12.0 (10.4-14.0) versus 9.6 (7.6-11.2) months, respectively; hazard ratio (97.7% confidence interval): 0.68 (0.52-0.90); p = 0.0006. Objective response rate was 17% with nivolumab versus 4% with docetaxel; median duration of response was not reached versus 5.3 months. Minimum follow-up was 8.8 months. The frequency of grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events was 10% with nivolumab and 48% with docetaxel. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first phase III study in a predominantly Chinese population reporting results with a programmed death 1 inhibitor. In this population with previously treated advanced NSCLC, nivolumab improved OS versus docetaxel. Results were consistent with global CheckMate 017 and 057 studies."

To facilitate population-based research in molecularly defined subgroups of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we assessed the validity of natural language  processing (NLP) for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK testing from electronic pathology (e-path) reports of NSCLC cases included in two SEER registries: the Cancer Surveillance System (CSS) and the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR). METHODS: We obtained 4,278 e-path reports from 1,634 patients who were diagnosed  with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC from September 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, included in CSS. We used 855 CSS reports to train NLP systems for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK test status (reported v not reported) and test results (positive v negative). We assessed sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values in an internal validation sample of 3,423 CSS e-path reports and repeated the analysis in an external sample of 1,041 e-path reports from 565 KCR patients. Two oncologists manually reviewed all e-path reports to generate gold-standard data sets. RESULTS: NLP systems yielded internal validity metrics that ranged from 0.95 to "1.00 for EGFR and ALK test status and results in CSS e-path reports. NLP showed high internal accuracy for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK in CSS patients-F cores of 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. In the external validation analysis, NLP yielded metrics that ranged from 0.02 to 0.96 in KCR reports and F scores of 0.70 and 0.72, respectively, in KCR patients. CONCLUSION: NLP is an internally valid method for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK test information from e-path reports available in SEER registries, but future work is necessary to increase NLP external validity."

This study is the first phase 3 randomised  trial recruiting only Asian patients to compare alectinib with crizotinib as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with 600 mg of alectinib twice per day. This study assessed consistency of the progression-free  survival benefit with the global phase 3 ALEX study. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 21 investigational sites in China, South Korea, and Thailand, Asian patients, aged 18 years or older, with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (2:1)  to twice-daily oral alectinib (600 mg) or crizotinib (250 mg). Patients were randomly assigned via a block-stratified (block size three) randomisation procedure, done centrally via an interactive voice or web response system, with stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and baseline CNS metastases. Clinical staff and the funder's drug safety and medical  monitoring staff had access to treatment assignments. The independent review committee was masked to treatment assignment, and funder personnel did not have access to efficacy and safety summaries by treatment group, before the formal reporting of study results. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were permitted. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The primary analysis population for efficacy was the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomly assigned patients. The primary analysis population for safety was defined as all patients who received at least one dose  of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02838420. FINDINGS: Between Aug 3, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 187 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 125 to alectinib and 62 to crizotinib. Median follow-up was 16·2 months (IQR 13·7-17·6) in the alectinib group, and 15·0 months (12·5-17·3) in the crizotinib group. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with alectinib versus crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22, 95% CI 0·13-0·38; p<0·0001; median progression-free survival not estimable vs 11·1 months). Independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the alectinib group compared with the crizotinib group (HR 0·37, 0·22-0·61; p<0·0001). The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 114 (91%) of 125 with alectinib, and 48 (77%)  of 62 with crizotinib, with a longer duration of response for alectinib than crizotinib (HR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12-0·40; p<0·0001). Time to CNS progression (cause-specific HR 0·14) and the percentage of patients who achieved a CNS objective response with measurable or non-measurable baseline CNS lesions were improved (32 [73%] of 44 patients treated with alectinib vs five [22%] of 23 patients treated with crizotinib). Despite longer treatment duration with alectinib than crizotinib (14·7 months vs 12·6 months, respectively), fewer patients had grade 3-5 adverse events (36 [29%] of 125 vs 30 [48%] of 62, respectively) or serious adverse events (19 [15%] of 125 vs 16 [26%] of 62, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Our results align with ALEX, confirming the clinical benefit of 600 mg of alectinib twice per day as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer.

Here, we report the efficacy of ABCP or  atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ACP) versus BCP in key patient subgroups. METHODS: IMpower150 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 240 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 26 countries worldwide. Patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive ABCP, ACP, or BCP every three weeks. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and investigator-assessed progression-free survival in intention-to-treat wild-type patients (patients with epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] genetic alterations were excluded). Efficacy was assessed in key subgroups within the intention-to-treat population, including patients with EGFR mutations (both sensitising and non-sensitising; EGFR-positive) previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors and patients with baseline liver metastases. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was included among secondary efficacy endpoints. Exploratory endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving an objective response in the intention-to-treat population, including EGFR-positive patients and patients with baseline liver metastases. Data are reported as per the Jan 22, 2018, data cutoff date, at which the number  of coprimary prespecified overall survival events was met in the ABCP versus BCP  groups.

Improved median overall survival with ABCP versus BCP was seen in patients with baseline liver metastases (13·3 months [11·6-NE] with ABCP [52 of 400] vs 9·4 months [7·9-11·7] with BCP [57 of 400]; HR 0·52 [0·33-0·82]). Median overall survival was 21·4 months (95% CI 13·8-NE) with  ACP versus 18·7 months (95% CI 13·4-NE) with BCP in EGFR-positive patients (HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·51-1·68]). No overall survival benefit was seen with ACP versus BCP in patients with sensitising EGFR mutations (HR 0·90 [95% CI 0·47-1·74]), in  the intention-to-treat population (HR 0·85 [0·71-1·03]), or in patients with baseline liver metastases (HR 0·87 [0·57-1·32]). In the intention-to-treat safety-evaluable population, grade 3-4 treatment-related events occurred in 223 (57%) patients in the ABCP group, in 172 (43%) in the ACP group, and in 191 (49%) in the BCP group; 11 (3%) grade 5 adverse events occurred in the ABCP group, as did four (1%) in the ACP group, and nine (2%) in the BCP group. INTERPRETATION: Improved survival was noted for patients treated with ABCP compared with those given BCP in the intention-to-treat population, and in patients with baseline liver metastases. The overall survival signal in the subgroup of patients with EGFR sensitising mutations warrants further study. FUNDING: F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Genentech."

The value of more comprehensive sequencing is unknown. METHODS: Prospective ctDNA analysis in patients with EGFRm NSCLC was performed using a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel of regions of 11 genes detecting single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions at ≥0.1% variant allele frequency (VAF) was performed. Patients were grouped according to treatment phase, including: (A) pre EGFR-TKI, (B) stable or responding to EGFR-TKI, (C) radiographic progression during EGFR-TKI, and (D) during chemotherapy treatment. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with stage IV EGFRm NSCLC were enrolled and first blood samples were analysed. Primary sensitizing mutations in del19 or L858R were present in 66 (92%) and uncommon EGFRm in 6 (8%). Mutations in ctDNA were found in 53 samples (74%). T790M was detected in 3 of 4 patients with T790M-negative tissue. Other co-occurring EGFRm were found in 10 patients (7%) including K745R during first-line osimertinib. TP53 (n = 10), KRAS (n = 1), PI3KCA (n = 1) and ALK (n = 3) gene mutations also were detected. The presence of an EGFRm (excluding T790M) was associated with untreated or progressive disease, p = 0.04. In TKI-treated patients without radiologic progression, median progression free survival (PFS) was 10 months versus 2.1 months (HR 2.22, 95% CI: 0.89-5.54, p = 0.08) if an EGFRm in ctDNA was detected. If T790M was present in ctDNA, median PFS was 3.0 months versus 9.7 months (HR 4.59, 95% CI: 1.43-14.73, p = 0.005). High % VAF of both EGFRm and T790M correlated with inferior PFS (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03 respectively). CONCLUSION: In addition to the emergence of resistance mutations, the presence of the primary or co-occurring EGFRm in patients receiving EGFR-TKIs may associate with shorter PFS and may be useful in longitudinal analyses of ctDNA to direct therapy."

However, there is limited information regarding the impact of these advances on patient survival in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC who received any treatment in the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR) between January 1, 1995 and March 1, 2017.  A total of 1,547 consecutive patients were included in this case series. In this  analysis, five diagnostic periods were evaluated: 1995-1999 (period A), 2000-2004 (period B), 2005-2009 (period C), 2010-2014 (period D), and 2015-2017 (period E). We compared overall survival (OS) between the periods before and after propensity score matching (PSM) and in patients with EGFR mutation, with ALK fusion gene, or without driver mutation. RESULTS: In the past two decades the OS of patients with stage IV NSCLC improved. The median OSs for periods A, B, C, D, and E were 9.0, 11.0, 13.7, 17.9 months, and not reached, respectively. After PSM with known baseline characteristics, the trend of improvement in OS was similar. However, the OS of patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion gene did not improve between periods, despite the availability of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Japan. The OS of patients without a driver mutation was slightly longer in the period E. CONCLUSION: The introduction of new classes of drugs has significantly improved the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC. However, the approval of similar types of drugs may not be associated with further improvement in survival."

We implemented three ALK laboratory methodologies: fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect EML4-ALK fusions and compared the predictive value for Crizotinib efficacy in ALK-positive patients. METHODS: 55 ALK positive patients confirmed by at least one method were enrolled  in the present study, of whom 45 cases were assessed by FISH, IHC and NGS concurrently, and another 10 cases only received IHC and NGS assessment for ALK status. RESULTS: IHC presented the uppermost positive rate (94.5%), followed by NGS (92.7%) and FISH(82.4%), among which IHC and NGS had the highest concordance rate of 87.3%. No difference was detected in ORR, DCR and PFS of ALK positive cases defined in three groups. Notably, NGS positive patients were correlated with a higher DCR and longer PFS compared to NGS negative cases (P = 0.02 and P = 0.09), while FISH and IHC status were not distinguishing in predicting the outcome of Crizotinib. TP53 concurrent mutation might reduce responsiveness to Crizotinib and worsen prognosis in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. CONCLUSION: FISH present a certain false-negative rate although considered the gold standard. Ventana-D5F3 IHC is qualified as a screening tool, while NGS positive may predict clinical benefit of Crizotinib more accurately, allowing efficient test for specific variants and concurrent genomic alterations."

The survival outcome remained overall poor, heterogeneous and was reported in association with genotypes in lung cancer patients with LM. Graded prognostic assessment model integrated with molecular alterations (molGPA) might be accurate for outcome prediction of LM patients, but needs to be established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively screened 8921 consecutive lung cancer patients from January 2011 to March 2018. A total of 301 patients diagnosed as LM were enrolled, and randomly divided into training and validation sets after stratified by gender and age. A molGPA score for each patient was calculated based on the weighted significant parameters including gene mutations. RESULT: The median OS for the 301 patients was 9.2 months (95%CI: 7.9-10.5). In the training set, EGFR/ALK positivity, Karnofsky performance score (KPS) score≥60 and absence of extracranial metastasis (ECM) independently predicted better OS. We developed a molGPA model based on above significant prognostic factors. This molGPA model classified LM patients into three prognosis groups of high, intermediate and low risk (molGPA score of 0, 0.5-1.0 and 1.5-2.0, respectively.  The median OS of high, intermediate and low risk LM patients in the training set  was 0.3, 3.5 and 15.9 months, respectively (p < 0.001). In the validation set, the median OS was 0.9, 5.8 and 17.7 months in the three molGPA subgroups, accordingly (p < 0.001). The C-index of this model in training and validation sets was 0.70 (95%CI: 0.66-0.73) and 0.64 (95%CI: 0.58-0.70) respectively. CONCLUSION: The LM molGPA model with integration of gene status, KPS and ECM can  accurately classify lung cancer patients with LM into diverse prognosis."

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to elucidate whether PE could be used as a surrogate for tumor tissue to detect EGFR mutations. METHODS: We extracted 2 × 2 diagnostic table from each included study and calculated data on specificity, sensitivity, negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR) ,and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). We used the area under curve (AUC) and summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) to summarize the overall diagnostic performance and assessed publication bias by  Deeks' funnel plot. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 15 eligible publications. The following summary estimates for diagnostic parameters of the EGFR mutations detection in PE were made: sensitivity, 0.86 (95%CI 0.83-0.89); specificity, 0.93 (95%CI 0.91-0.95); PLR, 8.53 (95%CI 5,94-12.25); NLR, 0.18 (95%CI 0.13-0.25); DOR, 63.40 (95%CI 38.83-103.51); and AUC, 0.94.

In the present report, a 61-year-old male patient was hospitalized due to cough, dyspnea, and right chest pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed spot- and piece-shaped shadows. The patient became very weak and had  breathing difficulty after preliminary anti-pneumonia treatment with cefoperazone-sulbactam. Physical examination revealed dull sound by percussion and decreased breath sounds in the right lateral lung areas by auscultation. A second CT scan revealed a large amount of pleural effusion, and the patient was diagnosed with bloody pleural effusion through pleural space puncture. Multiple nodular lesions were found in the right pleural cavity under thoracoscopy. PSC was confirmed by biopsy and histopathology in combination with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scan indicated multiple bone metastases. KRAS exon 2 mutation and EML4-ALK fusion were identified in carcinoma tissue by IHC and amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR. The patient received one cycle of first-line combination chemotherapy of cisplatin and paclitaxel liposomes. However, the patient did not  respond to the platinum-based combination chemotherapy within 3 weeks and was thus administered oral crizotinib instead of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, he still had rapid disease progression and died 2 weeks after the initiation of crizotinib treatment. Collectively, our results suggest that a PSC patient with coexistent KRAS mutation and ALK rearrangement would not benefit from chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment."

The current study aimed to investigate the feasibility of cytological specimens for ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine  kinase (ROS1) fusion detection by RT-PCR in advanced NSCLC patients. Patients and methods: A total of 2,538 patients with advanced NSCLC, including 2,101 patients with cytological specimens and 437 patients with tumor tissues, were included in this study. All patients were screened for ROS1 fusion status by RT-PCR. The efficacy of crizotinib treatment was evaluated in ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC patients. Results: Among 2,101 patients with cytological specimens, the average concentration of RNA acquired from cytological specimens was 47.68 ng/μL (95% CI, 43.24-52.62), which was lower than the average of 66.54 ng/μL (95% CI, 57.18-76.60, P=0.001) obtained from 437 tumor tissues. Fifty-five patients harbored ROS1 fusion gene that was detected by RT-PCR, and 14 of them were treated with crizotinib. The incidence of ROS1 fusion was 1.95% (41/2,101) in 2,101 patients with cytological specimens, similar to the rate of 3.20% (14/437,  P=0.102) for the 437 patients with tumor tissue. Regarding crizotinib treatment,  no statistically significant differences were observed in the objective response  rate (ORR) (81.8% vs 100%, P=0.604) between the cytological and tissue subgroups  of ROS1-positive patients.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), Sanger sequencing and real-time PCR are techniques commonly used in clinical laboratories. Many patients are required to use several of the above technologies to get a complete diagnosis, which is expensive and timeconsuming. Next generation of sequencing (NGS) has the advantage to simultaneously analyze multigene mutations. The average cost for each patient is affordable if each run  contains a certain number of samples. In this study, we tested a 10-gene, 32-mutation detection NGS method, which was used to test 195 samples from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sanger sequencing and Amplification-refractory Mutation System (AMRS) PCR were employed to verify Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) results. This NGS method was partially proved to have a higher sensitivity to detect mutations with low abundance than Sanger sequencing and even ARMS PCR. Using genomic DNA to detect gene fusions may have some disadvantages to miss low  abundance or large fragment fusions. As compared to using a few different technologies to analyze multigene mutations, small NGS analysis panel is a clinically applicable, efficient and affordable choice for NSCLC patients."

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company  that manufactures ceritinib (Zykadia®, Novartis) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug, as a first-line treatment for adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive (+) advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as part of the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process. The CRD (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) and CHE (Centre for Health Economics) Technology Assessment Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the  Company's submission (CS), the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The evidence submitted in support of ceritinib, as the first-line treatment in ALK+ advanced NSCLC, was a phase III, international, multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing ceritinib with pemetrexed/cisplatin plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy (chemotherapy [CT] group). The results indicated that ceritinib prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with  CT. The only comparator considered in the CS was crizotinib. The evidence selected in support of crizotinib was PROFILE 1014, an open-label RCT of crizotinib, compared with pemetrexed/cisplatin CT (without maintenance therapy),  in previously untreated advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC. The design and population of PROFILE 1014 was similar to that of ASCEND-4, though there were some differences between the trials. The Company considered it not possible to perform an 'anchor-based' analysis of first-line ceritinib and crizotinib, and presented a Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) of ceritinib and crizotinib using only the ALK inhibitor arm of ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. The indirect comparison suggests that ceritinib may be more effective in prolonging PFS than crizotinib. The ERG agreed that an indirect comparison using only the ALK inhibitor arm of the trials was the only option available in the present assessment; however, a number of limitations and potential bias were identified in this analysis. The Company's model estimated that ceritinib was cost effective when compared with crizotinib. However, the ERG highlighted several concerns with the Company's analysis; the ERG's preferred base case estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £69,255 per quality-adjusted life-year (no patient access scheme [PAS] included). The ERG considered the economic analysis to be sensitive to changes in assumption used, partly due to the due to the immaturity  of the overall survival data from trials, which leads to uncertainty around the extrapolation used. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that ceritinib is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for untreated ALK+  advanced NSCLC in adults, if the Company provides it with the discount agreed in  the PAS."

RESULTS: Primary resistance was observed in 6.5% of the patients. The median PFS  of the PRR and LTR groups was 1.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.73) and 47.0 months (95% CI 34.39-59.64), respectively. A better Eastern Cooperative  Oncology Group performance status score was significantly associated with longer  PFS (odds ratio 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.33; P = 0.001). The median overall survival (OS) of the PRR group was 8.4 months (95% CI 3.47-13.42) and crizotinib as first-line treatment was an independent predictive factor for survival outcome (P = 0.005). Patients administered ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors after crizotinib progression had significantly longer survival than the PRR group treated with best supportive care (P = 0.007), but no significant difference was  found between ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment and single chemotherapy (P = 0.944). CONCLUSION: Patients with primary resistance to crizotinib displayed unfavorable  survival outcomes and the underlying mechanism cannot be identified in clinical features. Nevertheless, next-generation ALK inhibitors and chemotherapy after crizotinib progression could confer a therapeutic and survival benefit in this population.  © 2019 The Authors.

Unfortunately, the majority of ALK-positive patients ultimately develop acquired resistance within one year after the initiation of crizotinib treatment; however, the estimation of overall survival (OS) beyond crizotinib resistance has not yet been fully demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to identify favorable predictors affecting survival outcome. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, the data of 136 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC beyond crizotinib resistance were analyzed between January 2013 and December 2017. Patients were divided into two groups according to intracranial or extracranial progression on crizotinib, and sequential therapies including crizotinib continuation with local therapy, next-generation ALK inhibitors, and chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the median OS duration from the start of crizotinib resistance to death or the last follow-up. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses of OS were carried out. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, 60 (41.1%) of the 136 patients had died. Median progression free survival (PFS) and OS from the metastatic diagnosis were 10.4 and 41.3 months, respectively.

Whole blood samples from the peripheral vein were taken at different treatment periods, and the mutations of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were detected. Multivariate analysis showed that smoking (P = 0.0308), mutation number > 2 (P = 0.0283), and max mutation frequency > 0.025 (P = 0.0450) were associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS). The overall survival (OS) of well-differentiated NSCLC patients was better than that of poorly differentiated ones (P = 0.0006). The rates of PFS, disease-free survival, local-regional recurrence-free survival, and local-regional progression-free survival were significantly higher in the group with a mutation number > 2 than in the group with a mutation number ≤ 2. The mutation number of the preoperation group was significantly higher than that of the postradiochemotherapy group (5 vs. 2.5, P = 0.023), and the max mutation frequency change was approximately significant in the postradiochemotherapy group compared with the postoperation group (2.6% vs. 1.85%, P = 0.067).

Necropsy revealed anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung, suggesting that it was involved in the prognosis of this patient. Based on the autopsy results, we reviewed the pathological tissue from transbronchial lung biopsy at the time of clinical diagnosis. The tissue specimen for clinical diagnosis in this case was a papillary adenocarcinoma. However, when this tissue was immunostained, thyroid transcription factor 1-negative and cytokeratin 5/6-positive parts were recognized. This result indicates that we could diagnose this patient as having had adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung. CONCLUSION: In cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung cancer poorly responsive to anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors, re-examination of the tissue should be considered because there is a possibility of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adenosquamous carcinoma."

[Epub ahead of print] ","rogrammed cell death ligand 1 expression in cytologic and surgical non-small cell lung carcinoma specimens from a single institution: Association with clinicopathologic features and molecular alterations.","BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by the 22C3 pharmDx companion assay has been validated in surgical specimens to support pembrolizumab treatment decisions for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The  aims of this study were 1) to assess the adequacy of cytologic specimens for PD-L1 evaluation and 2) to explore correlations of PD-L1 expression with clinicopathologic and molecular features. METHODS: The study cohort included 100 cytology specimens (fluid [n = 28] and fine-needle aspiration [n = 72]) and 165 surgical specimens (biopsy [n = 138] and resection [n = 27]). The PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 22C3 assay and staining assessment were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. PD-L1 expression was correlated with patients' demographics, pathologic characteristics, and molecular alterations. RESULTS: One hundred forty-two specimens (53.6%) were positive for PD-L1 expression (≥1%). No statistically significant difference in PD-L1 expression was identified between cytologic (56.0%) and surgical specimens (52.1%). Seventy-four of 190 tested cases (38.9%) had genetic alterations. PD-L1 positivity was significantly more prevalent in cases with genetic alterations than in cases without genetic alterations. Furthermore, both PD-L1 positivity and high PD-L1 expression (≥50%) had statistically significant associations with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations. PD-L1 expression had no significant association with histologic phenotypes or other clinicopathologic features. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that cytologic specimens are comparable to surgical specimens for PD-L1 evaluation. The association of PD-L1 expression with KRAS mutations may have clinical relevance in selecting patients with NSCLC for immunotherapy.  © 2019 American Cancer Society."

[Epub ahead of print]","Complete remission for 4 years with crizotinib in advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer after thoracostomy for empyema.","INTRODUCTION: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) gene translocation occurs in 3%-5% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), typically in younger patients. Crizotinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) has been considered as the standard of care for advanced ALK-positive lung cancer but it only gives a median progression-free survival of 7.7-11 months. CASE: A 41-year-old old man, former smoker, was diagnosed with NSCLC in the right lung with manifest pleural effusion. This case was complicated by a pleural empyema and because of a trapped lung, there was an indication for the construction of a thoracostomy. After confirmation of the ALK translocation, therapy with crizotinib was started. After 8 weeks, there was excellent response, and 6 months later, all lesions were undetectable on CT scan. There was also complete healing of the thoracostomy wound. CONCLUSION: This case describes a relatively young patient with a poor prognosis  but with a remarkable and long-term response to crizotinib monotherapy."

Recent years have witnessed a growing number of licensed second-line pharmacotherapies for advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With the aim of gauging patient survival benefit, we conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) and compared survival outcomes from available licensed treatments for patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC. METHODS: RCTs of second/third line treatments in participants with advanced/metastatic NSCLC and negative/low expression of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) were included. We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE; EMBASE; Web of Science) from January, 2000 up to July, 2017. Two or more independent reviewers screened bibliographic records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of studies. Published Kaplan Meier plots for OS and PFS along with restricted-mean-survival methods and parametric modelling were used to estimate the survival outcomes as mean number of months of survival. Network meta-analysis was undertaken to rank interventions and to make indirect comparisons. RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs with data for 7581 participants that compared nine different drugs. In studies of patients regardless of histology groups, targeted  drugs (ramucirumab and nintedanib) yielded small overall survival gains of < 2.5 months over docetaxel, erlotinib provided no benefit, while immunotherapies (atezolizumab and pembrolizumab) delivered 5 to 6 months gain. Studies with patients stratified by histology confirmed the apparent superiority of immunotherapy (nivolumab and atezolizumab) over targeted treatments (ramucirumab, nintedanib, afatinib) providing between about 4 to 8 months OS gain over docetaxel. In network analysis immunotherapies consistently ranked higher than alternatives irrespective of population histology and outcome measure. CONCLUSION: Our review indicates that nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab provide superior survival benefits compared to other licensed drugs for late stage NSCLC. Patient gains from these immunotherapies are substantial compared to the expected average survival with chemotherapy (docetaxel) of < 1 year for people with squamous histology and about 1.25 year for those with non-squamous histology."

[Epub ahead of print]","Concomitant EGFR Mutation and EML4-ALK Rearrangement in Lung Adenocarcinoma Is More Frequent in Multifocal Lesions.","BACKGROUND: The coexistence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement in patients with multifocal lung adenocarcinomas (LUAC) constitutes a rare molecular subtype of lung cancer.  We aimed to investigate the intertumoral heterogeneity of pathologic and genetic  characteristics of multifocal LUAC with EGFR/ALK co-alterations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1059 LUAC patients who underwent resection were  investigated to screen for EGFR or ALK alterations using amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry/fluorescence in situ hybridization. Molecular testing was extensively performed in patients with synchronous multifocal LUAC. Clonal evolution analysis was implemented using next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 97 multiple synchronous lesions were observed among 1059 LUAC patients. Patients with at least 1 sample harboring EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement were 62.89% (61/97) and 14.43% (14/97), respectively. Patients with concomitant EGFR and ALK alterations were 4.71% (4/97). Comparatively, patients with unifocal LUAC harboring EGFR mutation, ALK rearrangement, and EGFR/ALK co-alterations were 58.25% (570/962), 6.44% (62/962), and 0.83% (8/962), respectively. The prevalence of EGFR/ALK co-alterations in the multifocal LUAC was significantly higher than that in the unifocal LUAC (4.71% (4/97) vs. 0.83% (8/962)). Furthermore, we present 4 cases of EGFR/ALK co-altered multifocal LUAC  with different morphological and molecular patterns. In addition to radiographic, pathological, and molecular testing results, clonal evolutional analysis could also be used to distinguish intertumoral heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the importance of distinguishing synchronous primary tumors from intrapulmonary metastases, and of assessing the relative abundance of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement in patients with multifocal adenocarcinomas with EGFR/ALK co-alterations."

Intracranial efficacy is an important feature for these agents, as metastatic lesions frequently occur in the central nervous system in the ALK-positive setting. Here, we report on an updated case of a patient who received her diagnosis in 2005 and has had disease progression with new lesions on six occasions over the last 8 years. During the first two progressions, only local recurrence was observed. After that, the lungs stayed clear and the patient progressed exclusively in the brain and spinal cord. Initial treatments consisted of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2012, ALK-directed targeted therapy became available, and crizotinib was administered.  The treatment was switched to brigatinib 3 years later because of spinal cord lesions. Brigatinib induced partial remission and was followed by lorlatinib and, later on, alectinib, when new metastases arose in the spinal cord and brain. Each of these drugs promoted complete remission of the recent lesions. In November 2018, imaging showed multiple cerebral metastases. As radiotherapy was not an option because of previous irradiation, and as chemotherapy cannot be expected to be active in the brain, the patient underwent brigatinib rechallenge, which led to partial remission. All of the central nervous system relapses were symptomatic, with symptoms resolved rapidly during treatment. This case of a patient with EML4-ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer shows that sequential treatment with next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including rechallenge, can induce profound remission even in heavily pretreated patients, especially if the central nervous system is the site of progression."

The objective of this article is to introduce the use of time-dependent modeling approach in the updated exposure-efficacy analysis of ceritinib for the first-line indication. METHODS: Exposure-efficacy analyses, including data from 156 patients, were first conducted using time-independent logistic regression model for response of complete or partial response and Cox regression model for progression-free survival (PFS). The exposure measure used was average Ctrough, which is defined as the geometric mean of all evaluable Ctrough for each patient. To further investigate the impact of exposure measure on exposure-efficacy analyses, a time-dependent modeling approach was used, where exposure at different time intervals was associated with the corresponding response endpoints in a longitudinal manner. RESULTS: With exposure measure being average Ctrough, it was observed that higher exposure was associated with reduced efficacy in terms of response (odds ratio = 0.77) and PFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.12]. These time-independent models do not account for the impact of time-varying concentration due to dose modifications. Subsequently, a new time-dependent modeling approach was used, where exposure and efficacy were associated longitudinally in the analyses. The results showed that the odds ratio of response became 1.07, and the HR of PFS became 1.04, indicating no apparent reverse relationship between exposure and efficacy across the exposure range studied. CONCLUSION: The drug effect on efficacy in clinical trials could be better characterized using time-dependent exposure-response models."

METHODS: Target patients included almost all patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small cell lung cancer who were administered crizotinib. The  observation period was 52 weeks. In the present study, we focused on the treatment status and safety of crizotinib therapy and analyzed the real-world data obtained by this PMS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01597258). RESULTS: The safety analysis set included 2028 Japanese patients, and more than half of the patients (56.4%) were nonsmokers. The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 91.6%, and common ADRs (incidence ≥15%) were nausea (32.2%), diarrhea (24.3%), photopsia (18.9%), vomiting (17.5%) and dysgeusia (16.8%). Many patients (623 patients) discontinued treatment of crizotinib because of adverse events within 12 weeks after therapy initiation, which tended to frequently occur in the following cases: (1) elderly, (2) body weight <40 kg, (3) body surface area <1.2 m2 (4) ECOG PS 2-4, (5) higher Brinkman index and (6) history of occupational/environmental exposure such as asbestos/pneumoconiosis. The proportions of patients remaining on crizotinib therapy were 68.2% for 3 months,  55.2% for 6 months and 36.1% for 12 months, with a median duration of 7.9 months. Multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional hazard model identified 10 statistically significant patient background factors influencing the duration of  crizotinib therapy. CONCLUSIONS: No new safety concerns were observed in this PMS study. Our results  provide useful information regarding the status of crizotinib therapy in the clinical setting."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients in the Flatiron Health database (≥18 years; received first-line platinum therapy for advanced/metastatic NSCLC; ≥6 months of  follow-up) were assessed before (historical: January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013) and after (current: January 1, 2015 to May 31, 2017) FDA approval of anti-PD-L1 therapies for NSCLC. Index was start of second-line therapy. Baseline  variables, treatment patterns, and overall survival (OS) were reported. RESULTS: A greater proportion of patients in the current cohort received second-line treatment than in the historical cohort (n = 4240 [57.0%] vs. n = 2357 [37.4%]); 48.8% [n = 2071] of the current second-line patients received anti-PD-L1 therapy. Current patients were more likely to receive second-line anti-PD-L1 therapy if they had poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (≥2), had squamous histology, or had no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), or ROS proto-oncogene 1 mutations. Median OS from index was higher in the current cohort (9.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.9-9.9] months) than the historical cohort (7.3 [95% CI, 6.9-7.8] months). Adjusted for sex, race, ECOG performance status, disease stage, and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, EGFR, and ALK status, OS was improved by 15% in the current cohort. CONCLUSION: Contemporary patients are more likely to receive second-line therapy  and have longer OS than patients who received care before approval of anti-PD-L1  therapies."

We aimed to demonstrate noninferiority of comprehensive cell-free DNA (cfDNA) relative to physician discretion standard-of-care (SOC) tissue genotyping to identify guideline-recommended biomarkers in patients with mNSCLC.Patients and Methods: Prospectively enrolled patients with previously untreated mNSCLC undergoing physician discretion SOC tissue genotyping submitted a pretreatment blood sample for comprehensive cfDNA analysis (Guardant360).Results: Among 282 patients, physician discretion SOC tissue genotyping identified a guideline-recommended biomarker in 60 patients versus 77 cfDNA identified patients (21.3% vs. 27.3%; P < 0.0001 for noninferiority). In tissue-positive patients, the biomarker was identified alone  (12/60) or concordant with cfDNA (48/60), an 80% cfDNA clinical sensitivity for any guideline-recommended biomarker. For FDA-approved targets (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF) concordance was >98.2% with 100% positive predictive value for cfDNA versus tissue (34/34 EGFR-, ALK-, or BRAF-positive patients). Utilizing cfDNA, in addition to tissue, increased detection by 48%, from 60 to 89 patients, including those with negative, not assessed, or insufficient tissue results. cfDNA median turnaround time was significantly faster than tissue (9 vs. 15 days; P < 0.0001). Guideline-complete genotyping was significantly more likely (268 vs. 51; P < 0.0001).Conclusions: In the largest cfDNA study in previously untreated mNSCLC, a validated comprehensive cfDNA test identifies guideline-recommended biomarkers at a rate at least as high as SOC tissue genotyping, with high tissue concordance, more rapidly and completely than tissue-based genotyping."

We recently observed that high-dose (final concentration in vivo: ~10 µM)  crizotinib can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells lacking ALK/ROS1 activation through off-target effects that require the inhibition of several other tyrosine kinases. When combined with cisplatin (which alone does not induce ICD), crizotinib sensitizes NSCLC models to subsequent immunotherapy with PD-1 blockade, allowing to cure more than 90% of established orthotopic cancers. Of note, simultaneous treatment of mice with cisplatin, crizotinib and PD-1 blocking antibodies causes acute hepatotoxicity that can be avoided by a sequential regimen involving initial treatment with cisplatin plus crizotinib, followed by PD-1 blockade one week later. It will be important to translate these results obtained in mice into a clinical trial in NSCLC patients."

Known mutations were ascertained through the Sequenom LungCarta panel of 214 mutations in 26 genes, RET/ROS1 fusions, amplification of  FGFR1, and expression of ALK. Paired tumor and normal DNA was whole-exome sequenced for a subset of cases without known driver mutations.Results: Of the 193 tumors tested, 77 known driver mutations were identified in 66 patients (34.2%). Sixty-seven of the 127 patients without a known driver mutation were sequenced. In 54 of these patients, 50 nonsynonymous mutations were predicted to  have damaging effects among the 26 panel genes, 47 of which are not found in The  Cancer Genome Atlas NSCLC white or African American samples. Analyzing the whole-exome sequence data using MutSig2CV identified a total of 88 genes significantly mutated at FDR q < 0.1.

We performed tumor volume analysis of ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC treated with crizotinib to identify an early predictive marker for prolonged survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases of 42 patients with ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC (16 men, 26 women; median age: 55.7 y) treated with crizotinib as their first ALK-directed therapy were retrospectively studied. Tumor volume measurements of dominant lung lesions were performed on baseline computed tomography and follow-up computed tomography at 8 weeks of therapy. The relationships between the 8-week volume change (%) and overall survival (OS) were investigated. RESULTS: The 8-week tumor volume change ranged from -99.3% to 117.5% (median: -57.7%). Using the 25th percentile of the 8-week volume change of -74%, 11 patients with >74% volume decrease at 8 weeks had a significantly longer OS compared with 31 patients with ≤74% decrease (median OS: 92.0 vs. 22.8 mo; P=0.0048). In multivariable analyses using Cox proportional hazards models, the 8-week volume decrease of >74% was significantly associated with longer OS (hazard ratio=0.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.59; Cox P=0.008) after adjusting for tumor stage (stage IV vs. recurrent NSCLC, hazard ratio=5.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.29-24.3; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The 8-week tumor volume decrease of >74% is significantly associated with longer OS in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with crizotinib."

Still, many patients do not respond to these  inhibitors. PD-L1 (CD274) expression, one of the factors that influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, is dynamic. Here, we studied the regulation of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC without targetable genetic alterations in EGFR, ALK, BRAF, ROS1, MET, ERBB2 and RET. Analysis of RNA sequencing data from these NSCLCs revealed that inferred IFNγ, EGFR and MAPK signaling correlated with CD274 gene expression in lung adenocarcinoma. In a representative lung adenocarcinoma cell line panel, stimulation with EGF or IFNγ increased CD274 mRNA and PD-L1 protein and membrane levels, which were further enhanced by combining EGF and IFNγ. Similarly, tumor cell PD-L1 membrane levels increased after coculture with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, using EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and erlotinib or the MEK 1 and 2 inhibitor selumetinib, prevented EGF- and IFNγ-induced CD274 mRNA and PD-L1 protein and membrane upregulation, but had no effect on IFNγ-induced MHC-I upregulation. Interestingly, although IFNγ increases transcriptional activity of  CD274, MAPK signaling also increased stabilization of CD274 mRNA. In conclusion,  MAPK pathway activity plays a key role in EGF- and IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression  in lung adenocarcinoma without targetable genetic alterations and may present a target to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy."

Methods: The gene expression profiles were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus  (GEO). The identification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by GeneSpring GX. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to execute gene ontology function and pathway enrichment analysis. The protein interaction network was constructed by Cytoscape. The hub genes were extracted by MCODE and cytoHubba plugin from the network. Then, using BIRC5 as a candidate, the prognostic value in LAD and TN adenocarcinomas was verified by the Kaplan-Meier plotter and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, respectively. Finally, the mechanism of BIRC5 was predicted by a coexpressed network and enrichment analysis. Results: A total of 38 upregulated genes and 121 downregulated genes were identified. 9 hub genes were extracted. Among them, the mRNA expression of 5 genes, namely, BIRC5, MCM4, CDC20, KIAA0101, and TRIP13, were significantly upregulated among TN adenocarcinomas (all P < 0.05). Notably, only the overexpression of BIRC5 was associated with unfavorable overall survival (OS) in  TN adenocarcinomas (log rank P = 0.0037). TN adenocarcinoma patients in the BIRC5 high-expression group suffered from a significantly high risk of distant metastasis (P = 0.046), advanced N stage (P = 0.033), and tumor-bearing (P = 0.031) and deceased status (P = 0.003). The mechanism of BIRC5 and coexpressed genes may be linked closely with the cell cycle. Conclusion: Overexpressed in tumors, BIRC5 is associated with unfavorable overall survival in TN adenocarcinomas. BIRC5 is a potential predictor and therapeutic target in TN adenocarcinomas."

Among 4064 patients with NSCLC, exploratory associations between tumor genomics and patient characteristics with clinical outcomes were conducted, with data obtained between January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2018. Exposures: Tumor CGP, including presence of a driver alteration (a pathogenic or  likely pathogenic alteration in a gene shown to drive tumor growth); tumor mutation burden (TMB), defined as the number of mutations per megabase; and clinical characteristics gathered from EHRs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival (OS), time receiving therapy, maximal therapy response (as documented by the treating physician in the EHR), and clinical benefit rate (fraction of patients with stable disease, partial response, or complete response) to therapy. Results: Among 4064 patients with NSCLC (median age, 66.0 years; 51.9% female), 3183 (78.3%) had a history of smoking, 3153 (77.6%) had nonsquamous cancer, and 871 (21.4%) had an alteration in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 (701 [17.2%] with EGFR, 128 [3.1%] with ALK, and 42 [1.0%] with ROS1 alterations). There were 1946 deaths in  7 years. For patients with a driver alteration, improved OS was observed among those treated with (n = 575) vs not treated with (n = 560) targeted therapies (median, 18.6 months [95% CI, 15.2-21.7] vs 11.4 months [95% CI, 9.7-12.5] from advanced diagnosis; P < .001). TMB (in mutations/Mb) was significantly higher among smokers vs nonsmokers (8.7 [IQR, 4.4-14.8] vs 2.6 [IQR, 1.7-5.2]; P < .001) and significantly lower among patients with vs without an alteration in EGFR (3.5 [IQR, 1.76-6.1] vs 7.8 [IQR, 3.5-13.9]; P < .001), ALK (2.1 [IQR, 0.9-4.0] vs 7.0 [IQR, 3.5-13.0]; P < .001), RET (4.6 [IQR, 1.7-8.7] vs 7.0 [IQR, 2.6-13.0]; P = .004), or ROS1 (4.0 [IQR, 1.2-9.6] vs 7.0 [IQR, 2.6-13.0]; P = .03). In patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies (n = 1290, 31.7%), TMB of 20 or more was significantly associated with improved OS from therapy initiation (16.8  months [95% CI, 11.6-24.9] vs 8.5 months [95% CI, 7.6-9.7]; P < .001), longer time receiving therapy (7.8 months [95% CI, 5.5-11.1] vs 3.3 months [95% CI, 2.8-3.7]; P < .001), and increased clinical benefit rate (80.7% vs 56.7%; P < .001) vs TMB less than 20. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with NSCLC included in a longitudinal database of clinical data linked to CGP results from routine care, exploratory analyses replicated previously described associations between clinical and genomic characteristics, between driver mutations and response to targeted therapy, and between TMB and response to immunotherapy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of creating a clinicogenomic database derived from routine clinical experience and provide support for further research and discovery evaluating this approach in oncology."

Methods: The clinical data, histological slides, immunohistochemical stains and special stains of 806 lung biopsy specimens at Beijing Hospital from July 2015 to July 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnosis of lung cancer was reclassified according to the 2015 WHO lung tumor classification and related gene mutation data were analyzed. Results: During a three-year period, the total number of lung cancer diagnosis was 483 cases, including 221 female and 262 male patients with age ranging from 37 to 85 years (median age of 65 years). There were 40 cases(8.28%) of small cell carcinoma,11 cases (2.28%) of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, 3 cases (0.62%) of combined neuroendocrine carcinoma, 2 cases(0.41%) of atypical carcinoid, 208 cases (43.06%) of adenocarcinoma, 92 cases(19.05%) of non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma, 66 cases (13.66%) of squamous cell carcinoma, 42 cases(8.70%) of  non-small cell carcinoma, favor squamous cell carcinoma, 16 cases(3.31%) of non-small cell carcinoma, not otherwise specified, and 3 cases (0.62%) of non-small cell carcinoma, possible adenosquamous carcinoma. Among 202 cases tested, 107 cases (52.97%) showed EGFR mutations, including 86 of 133 cases (64.66%) of adenocarcinoma and 18 of 52 cases (34.62%) of non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma. Twenty two cases were found to have T790M mutation among 27 patients after EGFR TKI targeted drug therapy. Immunohistochemical staining of ALK (D5F3) was positive in 3 of 354 cases of non-small cell lung cancer, confirmed by EML4-ALK fusion gene fluorescence PCR. ROS1 gene fusion was found in 1 of 38 cases. Splicing mutations in exon 14 of MET gene were seen in one case of non-small cell carcinoma with spindle cell differentiation.

We performed a comprehensive analysis to compare the diagnostic value of CTCs and ctDNA for gene mutations in lung cancer. Methods: Publications were electronically searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of  Science as of July 2018. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, each with a 95% CI, were yielded. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.  Quality assessment of included studies was also performed. Results: From 4,283 candidate articles, we identified 47 articles with a total of 7,244 patients for qualitative review and meta-analysis. When detecting EGFR, the CTC and ctDNA groups had pooled sensitivity of 75.4% (95% CI 0.683-0.817) and 67.1% (95% CI 0.647-0.695), respectively. When testing KRAS, pooled sensitivity was 38.7% (95% CI 0.266-0.519) in the CTC group and 65.1% (95% CI 0.558-0.736) in the ctDNA group. The diagnostic performance of ctDNA in testing ALK and BRAF was  also evaluated. Heterogeneity among the 47 articles was acceptable. Conclusion: ctDNA might be a more promising biomarker with equivalent performance to CTCs when detecting EGFR and its detailed subtypes, and superior diagnostic capacity when testing KRAS and ALK. In addition, the diagnostic performance of ctDNA and CTCs depends on the detection methods greatly, and this warrants further studies to explore more sensitive methods."

[Epub ahead of print]","The Impact of Brain Metastases and Associated Neurocognitive Aspects on Health Utility Scores in EGFR Mutated and ALK Rearranged NSCLC: A Real World Evidence Analysis.","BACKGROUND: In lung cancer, brain metastases (BM) and their treatment are associated with high economic burden and inferior health-related quality of life. In the era of targeted therapy, real world evidence through health utility scores (HUS) is critical for economic analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study (2014-2016), outpatients with stage IV lung cancer completed demographic and EQ-5D-3L surveys  (to derive HUS). Health states and clinicopathologic variables were obtained from chart abstraction. Patients were categorized by the presence or absence of BM; regression analyses identified factors that were associated with HUS. A subset of patients prospectively completed neurocognitive function (NCF) tests and/or the FACT-brain (FACT-Br) questionnaire, which were then correlated with HUS (Spearman coefficients; regression analyses). RESULTS: Of 519 patients with 1,686 EQ-5D-3L-derived HUS, 94 (18%) completed NCF  tests and 107 (21%) completed FACT-Br; 301 (58%) never developed BM, 24 (5%) developed first BM during study period, and 194 (37%) had BM at study entry. The  sample was enriched (46%) for EGFR mutations (EGFRm) and ALK-rearrangements (ALKr). There were no HUS differences by BM status overall and in subsets by demographics. In multivariable analyses, superior HUS was associated with having  EGFRm/ALKr (p < .0001), no prior radiation for extracranial disease (p < .001), and both intracranial (p = .002) and extracranial disease control (p < .01). HUS  correlated with multiple elements of the FACT-Br and tests of NCF. CONCLUSION: Having BM in lung cancer is not associated with inferior HUS in a population enriched for EGFRm and ALKr. Patients exhibiting disease control and those with oncogene-addicted tumors have superior HUS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the setting of EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a diagnosis of brain metastases no longer consigns the patient to an inferior health state suggesting that new economic analyses in NSCLC are needed in the era of targeted therapies. Additionally, the  EQ-5D questionnaire is associated with measures of health-related quality of life and neurocognitive scores suggesting this tool should be further explored in prospective clinical studies."

A useful technique to screen for these fusions is the detection of native carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) protein by immunohistochemistry; however, the effects of other genetic alterations on C-terminal expression is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated whether C-terminal expression is specifically elevated by fusion with or without typical genetic alterations of lung cancer. METHODS: In 37 human lung cancer cell lines and four tissue specimens, protein and mRNA levels were measured by capillary western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the median of all 37 cell lines, mRNA levels at the C-terminus of all five of the fusion-positive cell lines tested (three ALK, one RET, and one ROS1) were elevated at least 2000-, 300-, or 2000-fold, respectively, and high C-terminal protein expression was detected. In an ALK fusion-positive tissue specimen, the mRNA and protein levels of C-terminal ALK were also markedly elevated. Meanwhile, in one of 36 RET fusion-negative cell lines, RET mRNA levels at the C-terminus were elevated at least 500-fold compared with the median of all 37 cell lines, and high C-terminal protein expression was  detected despite the absence of RET fusion. CONCLUSIONS: This study of 37 cell lines and four tissue specimens shows the detection of C-terminal ALK or ROS1 proteins could be a comprehensive method to determine ALK or ROS1 fusion, whereas not only the detection of C-terminal RET protein but also other methods would be needed to determine RET fusion."

Resistance to therapy is a major clinical issue contributing to the poor prognosis of lung cancer. In recent years, targeted therapy has become a concept  where subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with genetically altered receptor tyrosine kinases are targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). One  such subgroup harbors a gene fusion of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Although most NSCLC  patients with EML4-ALK fusions initially respond to ALK TKI-therapy they eventually develop resistance. While ALK kinase domain mutations contribute to ALK TKI-refractoriness, they are only present in a fraction of all ALK TKI-resistant tumors. In this study we sought to explore a possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in conferring resistance to ALK TKIs in ALK TKI-refractory  NSCLC cell lines. We subjected our ALK TKI-refractory cancer cells along with parental cancer cells to systematic miRNA expression arrays. Furthermore, ALK TKI-refractory cancer cells were exposed to a synthetic miRNA inhibitory Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)-library in the presence of ALK TKIs Crizotinib or Lorlatinib.  The outcome of the combined approaches uncovered miR-100-5p to confer resistance  to Crizotinib and Lorlatinib in EML4-ALK NSCLC cells and to be a potential therapeutic target in drug resistance."

ALK+ tumors have been associated with increased pleural and pericardial disease. Our primary objective  was to determine the uncommon sites of metastasis of ALK+ NSCLC. Secondary objectives included study of coexisting mutations and factors impacting survival  of ALK+ NSCLC. METHODS: All patients with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, California from 2010 to 2017 were selected for retrospective chart review. The demographic variables were collected. The molecular statuses of patients were evaluated through commercially available platforms for next-generation sequencing. Three-dimensional volumetric images were generated for the primary lesion and different sites of metastasis. RESULTS: Sixty two patients with ALK+ NSCLC were identified from 2010 to 2017. The median age was 59 with 36 (58%) female individuals and only 20 (32%) smokers. Twenty four patients had uncommon sites of metastasis which were thyroid, soft tissue, chest and abdominal wall, spleen, peritoneum, omentum, kidney, and ovary. Common characteristics of the primary lesions were right upper lobe location (N=23 [37%]), oval shape (N=22 [35%]), irregular margins (N=26 [42%]), solid lesions (N=27 [44%]), presence of pleural contact or effusion (N=22 [35%]). Twenty four patients had next-generation sequencing testing which showed coexisting mutations such as TP53 (N=8), EGFR (N=5), KRAS (N=3). Patients with uncommon sites of metastasis had a decreased median survival compared with common sites (39 vs. 82 m, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: In NSCLC, ALK rearrangements may not be mutually exclusive mutations  and can present with unique radiographic patterns. Patients with uncommon sites of metastasis may have worse outcomes."

Methods: This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the genomic alterations, treatment and prognosis of young patients under 40 years old from a  cohort of 640 lung adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma cases from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. All patients were examined for EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF and HER2 mutations and ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion genes. Results: In total, 54 patients were aged under 40 years. The frequencies of genomic alterations in younger (≤40 years) and older (>40 years) patients were 68.5% and 54.8%, respectively (P=0.05). Younger patients harbored a higher frequency of fusion genes (22.2% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001) but not gene mutations (46.3% vs. 45.6%, P=0.92). There was a general trend toward shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) (35.2 vs. 43.8 months, P=0.050), while no overall survival (OS) difference existed between younger and older patients (50.2 vs. 51.4 months, P=0.112).

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), notably antibodies directed against programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have transformed therapeutic standards in thoracic oncology. These ICIs are now the reference second-line treatment and numerous phase III trials have examined their efficacy in treatment-naïve patients. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy was validated for patients with ≥ 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1; pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and nivolumab have obtained good outcomes in combination with chemotherapy or another immunotherapy. However, in this context, other phase III  trials yielded negative findings for nivolumab alone (CheckMate-026) or in combination (MYSTIC trial). Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and the tumor mutation burden (TMB), enable better selection of patients who should benefit the most from first-line ICI use."

The hypothesis of this study is that EI24 might be a prognostic biomarker of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen gene expression NSCLC datasets with follow-up information (a total of 2582 accessible cases) were collected from Asia, Europe and North America. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses were applied to evaluate the relation between EI24 and the outcomes of NSCLC. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore EI24 and cancer-related gene signatures. RESULTS: EI24 was significantly upregulated in mutated TP53 NSCLC samples and significantly downregulated with the increase in the TP53 expression level in NSCLC. GSEA results suggested that EI24 significantly enriched metastasis and poor prognosis gene signatures. Meanwhile, EI24 was significantly upregulated in  lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal lungs (p < 0.01). It was also highly expressed in the later TNM stages and the ALK fusion+, higher MYC gene copy and EGFR wild type subgroups (p < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that  the expression of EI24 was significantly associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in a dose-dependent manner in GSE31210 dataset. The C-index of Cox model with EI24 is 0.70, that is better than that with MYC (0.51), KRAS (0.51) and EGFR (0.59), which indicates better prognostic performance of EI24. The prognostic significance of EI24 for overall survival of NSCLC was validated by pooled and meta-analysis on 14 datasets. The stratification analysis revealed that EI24 prognosticated poor overall survival (HR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.39-9.62, p < 0.05) in the TP53 wild type subgroup, but not in the mutated  TP53 NSCLC subgroup. Moreover, YY1 might transcriptionally regulate EI24 in a positive manner. CONCLUSION: EI24 is a potential prognostic biomarker and impacts poor outcome in  NSCLC. The prognostic significance of EI24 might rely on TP53 status."

The impact of concomitant TP53 mutations in ALK-rearranged NSCLC remains uncertain. METHODS: Tumor samples from 64 ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients receiving crizotinib treatment were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify TP53 mutational status. The clinicopathologic features of the TP53 mutations and its impact on the effect of crizotinib treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 64 ALK-rearranged patients, 15 (23.4%) patients showed a TP53  mutation. Of these, six cases had disruptive mutations and nine with nondisruptive mutations. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) for TP53 mutated patients were both significantly lower compared with  those for TP53 wild-type patients (p = 0.003 and 0.023, respectively). A significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) was found in TP53 mutated patients compared with TP53 wild-type patients (p = 0.045). Nondisruptive TP53 mutations were associated with a shorter PFS in comparison with disruptive TP53 mutations in ALK-rearranged patients (p = 0.069). When nondisruptive TP53 mutated patients were in comparison with TP53 wild-type patients, nondisruptive TP53 mutations were associated with a significant reduced PFS (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutations, especially nondisruptive mutations, negatively affected the response to crizotinib and correlated with shorter PFS in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients."

Although epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a mechanism of resistance to various targeted drugs, its involvement in ALK inhibitor resistance is largely unknown. In this study, we report that both ALK-mutant L1196M and EMT were concomitantly detected in a single crizotinib-resistant lesion in a patient with ALK-rearranged lung cancer.  Digital PCR analyses combined with microdissection after IHC staining for EMT markers revealed that ALK L1196M was predominantly detected in epithelial-type tumor cells, indicating that mesenchymal phenotype and ALK mutation can coexist as independent mechanisms underlying ALK inhibitor-resistant cancers. Preclinical experiments with crizotinib-resistant lung cancer cells showed that EMT associated with decreased expression of miR-200c and increased expression of ZEB1 caused cross-resistance to new-generation ALK inhibitors alectinib, ceritinib, and lorlatinib. Pretreatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor quisinostat overcame this resistance by reverting EMT in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicate that HDAC inhibitor pretreatment followed by a new ALK inhibitor may be useful to circumvent resistance constituted by coexistence of resistance mutations and EMT in the heterogeneous tumor. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that dual inhibition of HDAC and ALK receptor tyrosine kinase activities provides a means to circumvent crizotinib resistance in lung cancer."

The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADR), which are important identified risks for alectinib in Japanese patients. Overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, was assessed according to information on outcome. Overall, 1251 patients were enrolled. The median patient  age was 62.0 years; 12.9% of patients were aged ≥75 years. At baseline, 63.0% of  patients had received crizotinib and 40.6% had brain metastases.

Despite its initial efficacy, patients ultimately acquire resistance to crizotinib within 1 year. In such patients, the optimal sequential therapy after  crizotinib treatment remains unknown. This study explored which sequential therapy option confers the greatest benefit. Methods: A total of 138 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC resistant to crizotinib were studied. Based on patterns of disease progression of metastases,  patients were divided into 3 groups: brain progression, non-liver progression, and liver progression. Sequential therapies included crizotinib continuation plus local therapy, next-generation ALK inhibitors (ALKi's), and chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) from the time of crizotinib resistance to death or last follow-up. Results: The 138 patients included 64 cases with progression in brain, 57 cases in non-liver sites and 17 cases in liver. A significant difference in OS was observed among the distinct progression pattern (median OS, 25.4 months in brain, 15.8 months in non-liver, and 10.8 months in liver, respectively, P=0.020). The difference in OS among sequential therapies was statistically significant in the on-liver progression group (median OS, 27.6 months with next-generation ALKi's,  13.3 months with crizotinib continuation, and 10.8 months with chemotherapy, respectively, P=0.019). However, crizotinib continuation plus local therapy seems to provide non-inferior median OS compared with next-generation ALKi's for patients with brain progression (median OS, 28.9 months vs. 32.8 months, P=0.204). And no significant differences in OS were found in patients with progression in liver (P=0.061). Conclusions: Crizotinib continuation together with local therapy might be a feasible strategy for patients with progression in brain beyond crizotinib resistance, as well as next-generation ALKi's. Next-generation ALKi's tended to provide a survival benefit in patients with non-liver progression."

A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted to estimate the relative efficacy of these agents in the crizotinib-refractory setting. METHODS: MAIC is a propensity score-type method that adjusts for differences in baseline characteristics between trials to estimate relative efficacy. Analyses were based on patient-level data from the ALTA trial for brigatinib and published summary-level trial data from ASCEND-1 and ASCEND-2 for ceritinib and NP28761 and NP28673 for alectinib. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared. RESULTS: After matching, all key baseline characteristics were balanced between trials. Compared with ceritinib, brigatinib was associated with longer PFS (ASCEND-1: median 15.7 vs 6.9 months, hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval] = 0.38 [0.26-0.57]; ASCEND-2: median = 18.3 vs 7.2 months, HR = 0.33 [0.20-0.56]) and OS (ASCEND-1: not available; ASCEND-2: median 27.6 vs 14.9 months, HR = 0.33 [0.17-0.63]). Versus alectinib, brigatinib was associated with  longer PFS (NP28761: median = 17.6 vs 8.2 months, HR = 0.56 [0.36-0.86]; NP28673: median = 17.6 vs 8.9 months, HR = 0.61 [0.40-0.93]); results for OS were inconclusive (NP28761: median = 27.6 vs 22.7 months, HR = 0.70 [0.42-1.16]; NP28673: median = 27.6 vs 26.0 months, HR = 0.66 [0.39-1.09]). ORR was similar. CONCLUSION: In crizotinib-refractory ALK + NSCLC patients, relative efficacy estimates suggest brigatinib may have prolonged PFS and OS vs ceritinib and prolonged PFS vs alectinib."

Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a well-established technique in the diagnosis of various malignant tumors. FNAC is now an important technique in classifying lung carcinomas and also detecting salient mutational changes in lung carcinomas. The judicious use of the various immunological markers such as TTF-1, p40, CK 5/6, CK 7 and Napsin may help in sub-classification of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). The mutational changes in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ALK genes are needed in targeted therapy of adenocarcinoma of lung. With the help of immunocytochemistry, polymerase chain receptor, fluorescent in situ hybridization and next generation sequencing, one can detect  various mutational changes in NSCLC. In this review article, we have discussed the role of cytology and other ancillary techniques to classify lung carcinomas.  The important mutational changes in lung carcinoma for targeted therapy have also been discussed in detail."

Genetic factors, other than EGFR sensitive mutations, that allow prognosis of TKI treatment remain undefined. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 423 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR 19del or 21L858R mutations. A total of 71 patients whose progression-free survivals (PFS) were shorter than 6 months or longer than 24 months were included and stratified into separate groups. Genetic background discrepancy was analysed in the two groups using next generation sequencing (NGS). FINDINGS: Sensitive EGFR mutations of 19del or 21L858R were detected by NGS in all patients; the 21L858R mutation was the major type. The most frequent accompanying somatic mutations were TP53, RB1, MAP2K. ALK fusion, MET amplification, and BRAF V600E were found only in the short PFS group. Concurrent  pretreament T790 M mutation was found in both groups, but was proportionally higher in the short PFS group. In the short PFS group, patients had significantly more driver gene mutations than in long PFS group (P = 0·018). The numbers of concomitant somatic mutations, EGFR pathway-related mutations, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were not significantly different between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Co-occuring driver gene mutations were negative predictive factors of TKI therapy in EGFR-mutated patients. This study highlights the importance of exploring co-occuring genomic alterations before initiation of EGFR-TKIs."

Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have inaugurated a new period in the treatment of advanced cancers, but the path to approval of these biomarkers is filled with immunohistochemical challenges. The latter brings to the fore the significance of molecular pathology as a hub between basic and clinical research. Besides, novel markers are translated into routine practice, suggesting that we are at the beginning of a new exciting period. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular homeostasis unfolds biomarkers with greater specificity and sensitivity.

The eventual resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is monitored clinically and radiologically for prompt molecule shift to further generation TKI, if available. However, the early radiological detection of progression pattern (e.g. nodule onset) should be regarded with caution because overlaps exist with non-tumor cell proliferation and/or accumulation. Here we report the case of a stage IV ALK-rearranged NSCLC patient exposed to serial crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and lorlatinib (this latter brought to complete brain and leptomeningeal disease response), in a period of more than five years. During lorlatinib, the appearance of solid pulmonary nodules was obviously interpreted as disease progression. However, surgical biopsies of the pulmonary nodules revealed features of sarcoid-like granulomatous lymphadenitis, namely without tumor cell. This invasive approach, besides documenting for the first time a sarcoid-like reaction to ALK inhibitors, allowed to revert the radiological diagnosis and maintain lorlatinib, for the best patient outcome. The pragmatic relevance of these findings suggests a careful attitude towards the interpretation of radiologic patterns of disease progression in patients under TKI."

The aim of this study was to stage CAX in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by using a  classification based on the Fearon criteria and supported by quantifiable parameters. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional and non-interventional multicentre study. SMM was assessed by analysing L3 computed tomography-scan images. Patients completed  the anorexia/CAX subscale of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy, EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life (QoL) and International Physical Activity  Questionnaire (IPAQ). RESULTS: Patients were recruited in 56 sites. The analysis population comprised 531 patients, and SMM was assessed in 312 patients. Male patients were 66.5%, with a mean (SD) age of 65.2 (10.0) years, 79.9% were PS 0-1, and the tumour stage was mainly IIIB-IV (87.3%). Overall, 38.7% of patients had CAX, 33.8% pre-CAX, and 0.9% refractory CAX. Molecular tumour profiles were significantly associated with the presence of CAX: 23.9% in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, or HER2+ patients, 41.4% in K-RAS+, and 43.2% in patients with no molecular abnormality (P = 0.003). The more advanced the CAX stage, the poorer the scores of functional items of the QoL (P < 0.001) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (P < 0.001). Sarcopenia was present in 66.7% of CAX and 68.5% of pre-CAX patients. Overall, 43.8% of pre-CAX patients had only sarcopenia with limited weight loss (≤2%) and no anorexia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show the distribution of CAX in a population of NSCLC patients and an association between molecular abnormality in  NSCLC and CAX. The original Fearon classification for CAX stages was supported by the associated functional QoL scores and physical activity levels, resulting in a clinically relevant system for detection of early stages of CAX."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. The human gene TTN encoding for TITIN protein is known as major mutation  gene in many types of tumor including NSCLC. However, it is still controversial that TTN is a cancer-associated candidate considering tumor heterogeneity and complex genetic structure. In-depth researches on correlation between TTN mutation and NSCLC are still limited and discussable. METHODS: Related somatic mutation profiles and attached clinical data were from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung project. Clinical relevance analysis of TTN mutation was evaluated using univariate analysis and a binary logistic regressive model. Survival analysis and screening of independent prognostic factors in mutation types were conducted by Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: Available data covering lung adenocarcinoma (n = 517) and lung squamous  cell carcinoma (n = 492) were analyzed. TTN genetic mutations exhibited significant association with lung squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma possessed favorable overall survival benefits from TTN mutant type and both favorable overall survival and disease-free survival benefits from TTN/TP53 double mutation. For patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, about 85% of subjects with TTN mutation harbored missense variations,  which was an independent indicator of good prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Missense mutation of TTN may act as a beneficial role in lung squamous cell carcinoma, but not in lung adenocarcinoma."

Crizotinib inhibits oncogenic protein expression and impairs cellular proliferation in tumors with an overexpressed anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene. Currently used most frequently in the adult patient population, pediatric use is  becoming more prominent, specifically in disease states exhibiting anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, metastatic disease, such as neuroblastoma. Approximately 8% of neuroblastomas have activating anaplastic lymphoma kinase-mutations, making this a promising target for a difficult-to-treat disease. Studies in the pediatric population are limited. However, targeted anaplastic lymphoma kinase-inhibitor therapies have shown improved outcomes at both one-year and two-year marks in both overall survival and progression free survival in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer. One Children's Oncology Group phase I trial examined toxicities associated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor therapy in pediatric patients. Results revealed varying grades in severity of neutropenia, dizziness,  and liver function test elevation. In the adult population, severe toxicities reported by the manufacturer include effects on liver, cardiac and lung function. Additionally, several cases of severe, erosive, pill-esophagitis due to crizotinib therapy have been documented in the adult population. Erosive esophagitis is common in the pediatric population due to a variety of factors. Ingestion of medications or other corrosive agents accounts for approximately 3-5% (5000-10,000 cases per year) of esophagitis presentation in the pediatric population.

Here we performed a meta-analysis with the aim of assessing the efficacy of ALK inhibitors on BMs. Methods: A search of published trials was conducted in PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase. Data were pooled using the number of events/number of evaluable patients (non-small cell lung cancer patients with BMs) according to fixed or random effect models. Intracranial efficacy was assessed through overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and median progression-free survival (PFS). Subgroup analyses for baseline BMs, previous treatment with ALK inhibitor, study type, and current ALK inhibitor were made. Results: Twenty studies accounting for 2,715 patients were included. The pooled iORR was 48% (95% CI: 32-63%) in fifteen single-arm studies. The overall DCR was  65% (95% CI: 60-69%) from three studies include available data. The iORR was 79%  (95% CI: 64-91%), 45% (24-67%), 48% (34-63%), 18% (13-24%) in patients receiving  alectinib, ceritinib, brigatinib, and crizotinib, respectively. Five randomized studies assessed the intracranial efficacy of anti-ALK agents versus chemotherapy, the pooled RR for iORR was 3.54 (95% CI: 2.38-5.26), and the pooled HR for iPFS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.36-0.75; P=0.71) estimated in 2 studies. Conclusions: Despite the limitation from lack of published clinical data, our results showed that ALK inhibitors are effective at the brain site regardless of  previous anti-ALK treatments, systemic therapy with ALK inhibitors should be considered as a preferred approach over for controlling BMs from ALK-positive NSCLC."

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. Methods: We analyzed the clinicopathological data of 44 cases of advanced NSCLC targeted with ICIs in our hospital, between February 2016 and February 2018, in order to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. We also reviewed the literature regarding ICIs. Result: We retrospectively analyzed the 44 cases (26 nivolumab and 18 pembrolizumab cases). These patients were 38 men and 6 women, comprising 13 cases of adenocarcinoma, 29 squamous cell carcinoma and 2 unclassified types. Seven patients were using first-line therapy and while the others were using second-line therapy or later. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations were negative in all the cases. The response rate and disease control rate were 20.5% and 51.3%, respectively. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 146 days  and 257 days, respectively. We observed five severe adverse effects (AEs) (three  cases of interstitial pneumonia, one of liver dysfunction and one of adrenal failure), that were resolved by steroid pulse therapy. In multivariate analyses,  the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), pathological type, standardized uptake value (SUV) on positron emission tomography (PET), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin were independently prognostic factors. There were no significant differences in the prognosis between nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Conclusions: ICIs were effective in 44 treated NSCLC cases. Our analysis suggests that while ICIs are effective in treating patients, candidates must be carefully  selected and cautiously observed."

METHODS: Patients with stage IV NSCLC treated with an ALK inhibitor at the University of Colorado Cancer Center from 2009 through November 2017 were identified retrospectively. OS curves were constructed by using Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the  relationship of variables with OS. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were identified, 105 received crizotinib as their initial ALK inhibitor. With a median follow-up time  of 47 months, the median OS time from diagnosis of stage IV disease was 81 months (6.8 years). Brain metastases at diagnosis of stage IV disease (hazard ratio = 1.01, p = 0.971) and year of stage IV presentation (p = 0.887) did not influence  OS. More organs with tumor at diagnosis of stage IV disease was associated withorse OS (HR = 1.49 for each additional organ with disease, including the CNS [p = 0.002]). Each additional month of pemetrexed-based therapy was associated with a 7% relative decrease in risk of death. CONCLUSION: Patients with stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC can have prolonged OS. Brain metastases at diagnosis of stage IV disease does not influence OS. Having more organs involved with tumor at stage IV presentation is associated with worse outcomes. Prolonged benefit from pemetrexed is associated with better outcomes."

METHODS: Venous and arterial TEEs within ±365 days of diagnosis of ROS1+, ALK+, EGFR+, or KRAS+ advanced NSCLC at five academic centers in the United States and  China were captured (October 2002-April 2018). The primary endpoint was incidence of TEE in ROS1+ compared to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)+, EGFR+, and KRAS+ NSCLC within ±90 days of diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to assess if the odds of TEE differed among oncogene drivers. RESULTS: Eligible data from 95 ROS1+, 193 ALK+, 300 EGFR+, and 152 KRAS+ NSCLC patients were analyzed. The incidence rate of TEE was 34.7% (n = 33), 22.3% (n =  43), 13.7% (n = 41), and 18.4% (n = 28), respectively. In univariate analysis, the odds of a TEE in ROS1+ NSCLC were higher than ALK+, EGFR+, and KRAS+ cohorts. In multivariable analysis, the odds of a TEE were significantly higher for ROS1+  compared to EGFR+ and KRAS+ cohorts, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.44, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.31-4.57 (p = 0.005), and OR: 2.62, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.26-5.46 (p = 0.01), respectively. Although numerically superior, the odds for a TEE with ROS1+ compared to ALK+ was not statistically significant  (OR: 1.45, p = 0.229). Overall survival was not significantly different in patients with or without TEE within ±90 days of diagnosis in the overall study cohort or within each molecular group. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of peridiagnostic TEEs is significantly elevated in patients with advanced ROS+ NSCLC compared to EGFR+ and KRAS+ cases. TEE risk may be similarly elevated in ALK+ NSCLC."

The incidence of ILD associated with crizotinib therapy was 5.77%; and 3.45% patients showed grade 3 or greater. Pulmonary edema-like shadows with or without diffuse alveolar damage pattern were observed in crizotinib-associated ILD (incidence: 0.39%), but a causal relationship with the prognosis could not be identified. ILD developed within 4 weeks from initiation of crizotinib administration in 41.9% and within 8 weeks in 69.2% of the patients. Age 55 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  performance status 2-4, smoking history, previous or concomitant ILD, and comorbid pleural effusion were statistically determined as significant risk factors for crizotinib-induced ILD. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib therapy should be applied to the NSCLC patients with any  of above risk factors under a cautious monitoring for ILD occurrence, and clinicians should pay attention to the risks of severe ILD."

Neoadjuvant therapy had been commonly  considered an optimal management strategy for patients with operable locally advanced. However, as targeted therapy has been widely applied in advanced NSCLC, neoadjuvant targeted therapy has remained poorly explored in locally advanced disease. METHODS: We have described 11 ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK)-positive patients with pathologically confirmed N2 NSCLC who were treated with neoadjuvant crizotinib. All the patients were treatment naive and received crizotinib at a starting dose of 250 mg twice daily. Patient 3 was provided with dynamic monitoring before and after neoadjuvant therapy through next-generation sequencing of plasma and tissue. In case 4, next-generation sequencing of preoperative tissue was performed. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, 10 had a partial response and one was stable disease after neoadjuvant crizotinib, with one suffering from grade 4 hepatic damage. Of  the 11 patients, 10 (91.0%) received an R0 resection and 2 patients achieved a pathological complete response to neoadjuvant crizotinib. Six patients had disease recurrence, with five of them receiving crizotinib as first-line treatment and achieving a long duration of response. Dynamic monitoring of both plasma and tissue simultaneously indicated a decrease in sensitive ALK signaling  in patient 3 and a partial response (approximately 50% of partial response), and  no ALK-dependent resistance variants were captured. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant crizotinib may be feasible and well tolerated in locally  advanced disease for complete resection. Crizotinib therapy before surgery may provide thorough elimination of circulating molecular residual disease and not influence the reuse of first-line crizotinib, but ongoing prospective trials are  warranted to prove its efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting."

Y1003 is a binding site for E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is critical for MET degradation. Here we show an adenocarcinoma patient with Y1003S mutation and she got tumor remission after crizotinib treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 61-year-old never-smoking female was admitted to our hospital due to increased carcino-embryonicantigen. Positron emission tomography  (PET)-CT showed enlargement of bilateral cervical, left supraclavicular and multiple mediastinal lymph nodes. PET-CT also showed stripe in the left upper lobe. Adenocarcinoma cells were found from biopsy on her left supraclavicular lymph nodes. We detected cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from peripheral  blood and identified a MET Y1003S mutation by next generation sequencing technology. Y1003 mutations predicted to be similar to MET exon 14 skipping in functionality based on the literature. After an extensive discussion of treatment options, the patient opted to treatment with crizotinib, a small-molecule dual inhibitor of the MET and ALK. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Dramatic response was observed within 1 months of treatment, which lasted more than 10 months. Chest CT scans revealed significant  improvement of the lung focus and decrease in size of the lymph nodes lesions, meeting RECIST partial response criteria (-30%). Y1003 alterations may be diverse mutations and sensitive to MET inhibitors."

We report results from dose-finding and dose-expansion cohorts of the phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-021 study that evaluated combination therapy with anti‒programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab plus anti‒cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab in patients with previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria stipulated histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC and treatment failure on ≥1 prior systemic therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted therapy for patients with EGFR/ALK aberrations). In the dose-finding cohort, patients initially received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 or 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy for up to 2 years. Based on emerging published data, subsequent patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. Objective response rate (ORR; primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded, independent central review. Phase 2 hypothesis that ORR would be greater than the 20% rate for historical controls was evaluated using the exact binomial test. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 71% received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at any dose level. Among patients who received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 44), ORR was 30%  (95% CI, 17%-45%), but not statistically significantly >20% (P = 0.0858). Median  progression-free survival in this group was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.4-5.8) months; median  overall survival was 10.9 (95% CI, 6.1-23.7) months. With pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, incidences of treatment-related adverse events, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events, and immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions were 64%, 29%, and 42%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC, pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab showed evidence of antitumor activity, but was associated with meaningful toxicity."

It is generally believed that the incidence of CNS metastasis is lower in ROS1+ NSCLC than ALK+ NSCLC as ROS1 fusions are regarded as a less powerful driver mutation than ALK fusions in ALK+ NSCLC based on the longer progression-free survival of ROS1+ NSCLC patients than ALK+ NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib. Here we reviewed the incidence of CNS metastasis from prospective clinical trials and retrospective case series from primarily single institution. The incidence of CNS metastasis in ROS1+ NSCLC patients at the time of diagnosis ranged from 20% to mid 30% while the incidence of CNS metastasis can be as high as in the mid 50% range post-crizotinib indicating CNS metastasis is indeed a major morbidity for ROS1+ NSCLC patients throughout the course of treatment. To date 22 fusion partners in ROS1+ NSCLC have been reported in the literature and one report has indicated CD74-ROS1 fusion variant increased the predilection for CNS metastasis  than non-CD74-ROS1 fusion variants. We reviewed reported intra-cranial activity of all preclinical and clinical development stage ROS1 TKIs and pemetrexed-based  chemotherapy in ROS1+ NSCLC patients. While several ROS1 TKIs (i.e. entrectinib,  cabozantinib, lorlatinib, repotrectinib) have reported intra-cranial response rates, there is no literature reporting on the intra-cranial activity of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy in ROS1+ NSCLC patients. In summary, better understanding the high incidence of CNS metastasis in ROS1+ NSCLC patients, how certain ROS1 fusion variant may increase the incidence of CNS metastasis, and any intra-cranial efficacy data of pemetrexed in ROS1+ NSCLC are all urgently needed."

However, whether a similar conclusion can be applied to lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LSCC) has remained unclear. We therefore evaluated  the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) status and the therapeutic effect of an ALK  tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in IHC- or FISH-positive LSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2403 LSCC patients from three institutions were screened for ALK aberration by IHC. All IHC-positive cases were subjected to FISH (with an approximately equal number of negative cases as a control group) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical efficacy was evaluated for the patients who received TKI therapy. RESULTS: In 2403 cases of LSCC, 37 cases were identified as ALK-positive by IHC.  After quality control, 28 cases were succeeded by FISH (six with insufficient tissue, three with lack of signals) and 13 by NGS (24 failed due to insufficient  samples or poor DNA quality); the percentage of non-diagnostic tests was 24.3% (9/37) and 64.9% (24/37), respectively. Four cases (4/2394, 0.17%) analyzed by FISH were determined as ALK-positive. For the control group (40 ALK IHC), FISH demonstrated no samples with ALK gene fusion. The concordance between ALK IHC- and ALK FISH-positive results was 14.3% (4/28). In the 13 cases studied by NGS, two cases showed ALK-EML4 fusion (consistent with two FISH-positive results), and two cases were interpreted as harboring an ALK-association gene mutation. Among four patients (two FISH-positive and two IHC-positive only cases) receiving TKI therapy, two patients had stable disease and the other two had progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: The positive concordance rate of ALK IHC and FISH in LSCC is far less than that reported for LADC. Therefore, ALK IHC detection in LSCC cannot be  used as a diagnostic method for ALK rearrangement."

The relationship between non-small cell lung cancer PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics remains unclear and there is no population level Australian data. We report the results of PD-L1 testing in patients with non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed at major Western Australian public hospitals served by a single  state Pathology provider. We analyzed PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 241 non-small cell lung cancer specimens using the 22C3 clone on a Dako autostainer platform. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was scored as Tumor Proportion  Score and categorized using pre-specified subsets of  1%, 1-49% and  ≥  50% for correlation with clinicopathologic features. PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was  1% in 65 (27%) cases, 1-49% in 100 (41%) cases and  ≥  50% in 76 (32%) cases. PD-L1-positive rate was 92% in squamous cell carcinomas and 67% in adenocarcinomas. PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was higher in squamous cell carcinomas (p  =  0.004) and lower in adenocarcinomas (p  =  0.003). Of the 196 non-squamous carcinomas, 35% had rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) mutations, 13% had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, 2% had anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations and 2% had ROS1 translocations. Tumor Proportion Score  ≥  50% was seen in 34% (23/68), 28% (7/25) and 25% (1/4)  of RAS, EGFR mutant, and ALK translocated carcinomas, respectively. There was no  significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and molecular or genetic abnormalities, or other parameters including age, gender, stage, and smoking status. In our patient cohort, PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas and lower in adenocarcinomas.

However, achieving superior clinical outcomes for patients with lung cancer requires developing comprehensive techniques beyond contemporary EGFR/ALK testing. Current technologies are on par with molecular testing for EGFR/ALK in terms of efficacy, most of them failing to offer improvements perhaps primarily due to skepticism among clinicians, despite being recommended in the NCCN guidelines. The present study endeavored to minimize chemotherapy-dependence in EGFR/ALK-negative patient cohorts, and use evidence-based methods to identify ways to improve clinical outcomes. In total, 137 lung cancer cases obtained from 'PositiveSelect NGS data', comprising 91 males and 46 females, were investigated. EGFR- and ALK-positivity was used for data dichotomization to understand the therapeutic utility of rare gene alterations beyond just EGFR/ALK. Statistics obtained from PositiveSelect were collated with data from international studies to construct a  meta-analysis intended to achieve better clinical outcomes. Upon dichotomization, 23% of cases harbored EGFR variants indicating that treating with EGFR TKIs would be beneficial; the remaining 77% exhibited no EGFR variants that would indicate favorable results using specific currently available chemotherapy practices. Similarly, 28% of cases had EGFR+ALK variants favoring EGFR/ALK-based targeted therapeutics; the remaining 72% harbored no EGFR/ALK variants with known beneficial chemotherapy routes. The present study aimed to overcome current inadequacies of targeted therapies in patients with a conventional EGFR/ALK-positive diagnosis and those in EGFR+ALK-negative cohorts. Upon analysis of the negative cohorts, significant and clinically relevant single nucleotide variants were identified in KRAS, ERBB2, MET and RET, with frequencies of 7, 1, 2 and 3% in patients who were EGFR-negative and 6, 1, 1, and 3% in patients who were EGFR and ALK-negative, respectively, enabling the use of targeted therapeutics aside from EGFR/ALK TKIs. From the results of the current study only 35% of the two negative arms (EGFR negative and EGFR+ALK negative) would be recommended NCCN or off-label chemotherapy; prior to the current study, the entire cohorts would have been recommended this treatment. The present study emphasizes the potential of comprehensive genomics in identifying hallmarks of lung cancer beyond EGFR/ALK, using broad-spectrum genetic testing and data-sharing among medical professionals to circumvent ineffective chemotherapy."

Major progress in terms of systemic treatments has been achieved in recent decades. Access to new anti-PD-(L) 1 immunotherapies and targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oncogenic addiction such as EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement have led to improved outcomes. Patients with limited progression of their disease during systemic treatment may be a particular subgroup. This oligoprogressive state is characterized by a limited number of sites in progression, implying that the other sites remain controlled and therefore sensitive to systemic treatments. The advent of non-invasive techniques such as stereotactic radiotherapy, radiofrequency, and mini-invasive surgery has led to a precise re-evaluation of local ablative treatments in this situation. Local treatment of the oligoprogressive lesion(s) may allow modification of the natural history of the disease, maintenance of effective systemic targeted treatment and, ultimately, to improved survival. Data validating an aggressive local therapeutic approach in oligoprogressive NSCLC patients are currently limited and essentially retrospective. Several international trials are underway that could confirm the clinical benefit of radical local treatment in oligoprogressive advanced NSCLC patients."

Crizotinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treating ALK-rearranged NSCLC, has shown remarkable response in ALK-positive NSCLC. However, heterogeneity of clinical responses exists among different ALK fusion partners. Several small studies have investigated the correlation between fusion  partners and efficacy, but not yielded consistent results. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence of ALK rearrangements in a Chinese NSCLC population, and correlated clinical outcomes of crizotinib with different ALK partners/variants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed genomic profiling and clinical  data of 110 ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients from five centers. The clinical response to crizotinib and survival data in ALK-positive patients was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 134 ALK rearrangements with 39 partners were identified in 110 patients (5.6%) among a cohort of 1971 NSCLC patients. The most frequently occurring ALK fusion partner was EML4, which was identified in 71.6% (96/134) of ll of the rearrangements in 87.3% (96/110) patients, and with variant 3 (41/96,  42.7%) as the main variant type. No statistically significant differences in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were found between EML4-ALK and non-EML4-ALK NSCLC patients in our cohort (PFS, p = 0.207; OS, p = 0.678). Outcomes did not differ significantly between patients above and  below 40 years of age (PFS, p = 0.427; OS, p = 0.686), nor between patients treated with crizotinib in different lines of therapy (PFS, p = 0.171; OS, p = 0.922). For EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC (n = 96), patients harboring variant 3 or variant 5 displayed significantly lower PFS and OS than those with other variants (PFS, 8.6 vs. 11.3 months, p = 0.046; OS, 31.0 vs. 37.6 months, p = 0.026). In addition, patients with a single EML4-ALK rearrangement event displayed favorable PFS (10.0 vs. 7.2 months, p = 0.040) and OS (36.0 vs. 20.0 months, p = 0.029) compared to those harboring multiple ALK rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the patterns of ALK fusion variants present in Chinese NSCLC patients and might help explain heterogeneous clinical outcomes  to crizotinib treatment according to different ALK fusion variants."

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of targeted therapies in these patients compared with patients with EGFR or ALK alterations alone. METHODS: Patients were screened for EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement at the Shanghai Chest Hospital (2011-2017). Progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and overall survival (OS) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 5816 patients were screened, and 26 patients were identified  as having concomitant EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements; 22 patients were eligible for survival analysis. Additionally, 95 EGFR-mutant patients and 60 ALK-rearranged patients were randomly selected for analysis. The ORR to EGFR TKIs was 63.2% (12/19) for EGFR/ALK co-altered patients and 62.1% (59/95) for EGFR-mutant patients (p = 0.93) with a median PFS of 10.3 and 11.4 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-1.57; p = 0.87). The ORR to crizotinib was 66.7% (8/12) for double-positive patients and 65.0% (39/60) for ALK-rearranged patients (p = 1.00), with a median PFS of 11.1 and 12.5 months, respectively (HR 1.39; 95% CI 0.69-2.80; p = 0.28).

Lung cancer has familial aggregation. Lung cancer caused by non-tobacco factors has unique pathological and molecular characteristics. The interaction between genetic lung cancer susceptibility and carcinogens from coal burning remains complex and understudied. METHODS: We selected 410 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a family history of lung cancer (FLC) and exposure to coal combustion between 2014  and 2017. Clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed to detect ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 rearrangement. RESULTS: Among the 410 NSCLC patients, 192 had FLC and 204 (49.8%) were exposed to occupational or domestic coal combustion. FLC patients had the same characteristics regardless of gender and coal exposure: younger age, high female  ratio, adenocarcinoma, increased metastasis, later stage at diagnosis, and higher frequency of gene fusion. Sixty-seven patients (16.3%) had gene rearrangement: 51 (12.4%) harbored EML4-ALK fusions and 16 ROS1 fusions (3.9%). The highest gene fusion rate (35.1%, 33/94) occurred in patients with both FLC and high tobacco and coal exposure. ALK fusions and total gene rearrangement were closely associated with women, never smokers, younger age, FLC, and coal exposure. CONCLUSION: FLC and exposure to coal combustion have an important impact on the clinicopathological characteristics and gene fusion mode of NSCLC, particularly in cases of higher levels of carcinogens, and genetic susceptibility has a greater impact. Our findings may help evaluate the effect of FLC and coal exposure on the pathogenesis of lung cancer."

The clinical characteristics and overall survival were analyzed for the two genotype cohorts and stratified by different age categories (<40, 40-49, 50-59, ≥60 years). Results: In the ALK-positive cohort, the younger group showed more frequent disease in the T3/4 stage (P=0.014), lymph node metastasis (P=0.011) and distant  metastasis (P=0.015) than the older groups. Meanwhile, the mean age at diagnosis  for the ALK-positive patients showed a significant inverse correlation with the clinical stages (stage I/II vs. III vs. IV, 54.7 vs. 52.0 vs. 49.7 years; P<0.001), as well as with the T, N, and M categories. However, KRAS-mutant patients did not exhibit similar relationships to those observed in ALK-positive  patients. Importantly, for ALK-positive patients, the frequency of stage IIIb-IV  disease was almost twice that of stage I-IIIa disease (6.1% vs. 3.4%, P<0.001); there was a similar incidence of the different disease stages in KRAS-mutant lung cancer (P=0.924). Lastly, in ALK-positive patients, the ≥60 years group was associated with a trend toward better survival than the other younger groups. Conclusions: The TNM stages exhibited a significant inverse correlation with age  at diagnosis for ALK-positive lung cancer patients. More unique therapeutic strategies should be required in these young patients."

Combining these immunotherapies with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment has resulted in improved response rates and increased survival when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Certain patient populations may even benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in the first-line setting. The PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is approved as monotherapy or in combination with platinum + pemetrexed for most newly diagnosed patients with metastatic NSCLC, excluding those with a targetable oncogene such as ALK and EGFR. The PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab is also approved in combination with bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for the same population, with some parts of the world also approving this regimen for patients with ALK rearrangements or EGFR activating mutations.

[Epub ahead of print]","First-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement: state of the art and future development.","INTRODUCTION: Approximately 5% of all diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbor a genetic rearrangement between the ALK and EML4 genes, representing a specific molecular, histological and clinical subgroup (ALK+ NSCLC). To date, upfront treatment with ALK-tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) has replaced chemotherapy in the first line setting for this subset of patients with excellent results. However, all treated patients eventually develop acquired resistance mechanisms to these agents (mainly resistance mutations) and experience progression of the disease. Areas covered: This paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art review about first-line approved ALK-TKIs, furthermore, it discusses the most promising ALK-TKIs under development designed  to overcome resistance mutations and their implications. Expert opinion: Alectinib should currently be regarded as the standard of care for the first-line treatment of ALK+ NSCLC, considering its superior efficacy and safety profile. Regarding developing agents, lorlatinib and ensartinib appear to be the most promising ones, even though the data from their trials are still immature."

Here, we present a NanoString gene expression platform and a novel platform-independent, single sample predictor (SSP) of NSCLC histology for combined, simultaneous, histological classification and fusion gene detection in  minimal formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The SSP was developed in  68 NSCLC tumors of adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) histology, based on NanoString expression of 11 (CHGA, SYP, CD56, SFTPG, NAPSA, TTF-1, TP73L, KRT6A, KRT5, KRT40, KRT16) relevant genes for IHC-based NSCLC histology classification. The SSP was combined with a gene fusion detection module (analyzing ALK, RET, ROS1, MET, NRG1, and NTRK1) into a multicomponent NanoString assay. The histological SSP was validated in six cohorts varying in size (n = 11-199), tissue origin (early or advanced disease), histological composition (including undifferentiated cancer), and gene expression platform. Fusion gene detection revealed five EML4-ALK fusions, four KIF5B-RET fusions, two CD74-NRG1 fusion and three MET exon 14 skipping events among 131 tested cases. The histological SSP was successfully  trained and tested in the development cohort (mean AUC = 0.96 in iterated test sets). The SSP proved successful in predicting histology of NSCLC tumors of well-defined subgroups and difficult undifferentiated morphology irrespective of gene expression data platform. Discrepancies between gene expression prediction and histologic diagnosis included cases with mixed histologies, true large cell carcinomas, or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with mucin expression. In summary, we present a proof-of-concept multicomponent assay for parallel histological classification and multiplexed fusion gene detection in archival tissue, including a novel platform-independent histological SSP classifier. The assay and SSP could serve as a promising complement in the routine evaluation of  diagnostic lung cancer biopsies."

[Epub ahead of print]","Different Types of ROS1 Fusion Partners Yield Comparable Efficacy to Crizotinib.","ROS1 rearrangements define a distinct molecular subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which can be treated effectively with crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting ROS1/MET/ALK rearrangements. Diverse efficacy was observed in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC patients. Because of its rareness, very limited studies have investigated the correlation between different fusion partners and response to crizotinib. In this study, we retrospectively screened 6,235 advanced NSCLC patients (Stage IIIB to IV) from 5 hospitals and identified  106 patients with ROS1-rearrangements based on either plasma or tumor tissue testing using capture based targeted sequencing. The most frequently occurred fusion partners included cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74), ezrin (EZR), syndecan 4 (SDC4) and tropomyosin 3 (TPM3), occurring in 49.1%, 17%, 14.2% and 4.7% of patients, respectively. Among them, 38 patients were treated with crizotinib. Seventeen patients were treatment-naïve and the remaining were previously treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Collectively, there was no significant difference among patients with various types of ROS1 fusion partners  in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Patients who were treated with crizotinib as first line therapy showed comparable PFS (p=0.26) to patients who were previously treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. For treatment-naïve patients, patients with low baseline ROS1 allelic fraction (AF) had a statistically significant longer OS than those with high ROS1 AF (184 vs. 110 days, P = 0.048). Collectively, our study demonstrates ROS1-positive patients with various fusion partners show comparable efficacy to crizotinib."

[Epub ahead of print]","Genomic Signature of Driver Genes Identified by Target Next-Generation Sequencing in Chinese Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common human malignancies and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Over the past few decades, genomic alterations of cancer driver genes have been identified in NSCLC, and molecular testing and targeted therapies have become standard care for lung cancer patients. Here we studied the unique genomic profile of driver genes  in Chinese patients with NSCLC by next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,200 Chinese patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. The median age was 60 years (range: 26-89), and 83% cases were adenocarcinoma. NGS-based genomic profiling of major lung cancer-related genes was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples and matched blood. RESULTS: Approximately 73.9% of patients with NSCLC harbored at least one actionable alteration recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ALK, ERBB2, MET, BRAF, RET, and ROS1. Twenty-seven patients (2.2%) harbored inherited germline mutations of cancer susceptibility genes. The frequencies of EGFR genomic alterations (both mutations and amplification) and ALK rearrangement were identified as 50.1% and 7.8% in Chinese NSCLC populations, respectively, and significantly higher than the Western population. Fifty-six distinct uncommon EGFR mutations other than L858R, exon19del, exon20ins, or T790M were identified in 18.9% of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. About 7.4% of patients harbored both sensitizing and uncommon mutations, and 11.6% of patients harbored only uncommon  EGFR mutations. The uncommon EGFR mutations more frequently combined with the genomic alterations of ALK, CDKN2A, NTRK3, TSC2, and KRAS. In patients <40 years  of age, the ALK-positive percentage was up to 28.2%. Moreover, 3.2% of ALK-positive patients harbored multi ALK rearrangements, and seven new partner genes were identified. CONCLUSION: More unique features of cancer driver genes in Chinese NSCLC were identified by next-generation sequencing. These findings highlighted that NGS technology is more feasible and necessary than other molecular testing methods, and suggested that the special strategies are needed for drug development and targeted therapy for Chinese patients with NSCLC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Molecular targeted therapy is now the standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Samples of 1,200 Chinese patients with NSCLC were analyzed through next-generation sequencing to characterize the unique feature of uncommon EGFR mutations and ALK fusion. The results showed that 7.4% of EGFR-mutant patients harbored both sensitizing and uncommon mutations and 11.6% harbored only uncommon mutations. Uncommon EGFR mutations more frequently combined with the genomic alterations of ALK, CDKN2A, NTRK3, TSC2, and KRAS. ALK fusion was more common in  younger patients, and the frequency decreased monotonically with age. 3.2% of ALK-positive patients harbored multi ALK rearrangement, and seven new partner genes were identified."

Few case reports have  focused on other types of histological transformation. We report a case of transformation of ALK rearrangement-positive adenocarcinoma to NSCLC with neuroendocrine differentiation during alectinib therapy. A 36-year-old woman presented with a tumor in the left lower lobe and bone metastases. She was diagnosed with ALK rearrangement-positive adenocarcinoma by histopathology of the primary tumor. Alectinib had been effective for 8 months before new lesions appeared. Histopathological re-examination of a recurrent tumor revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) expression, which remained ALK-positive. Expression of CD133, BCL-2, and SOX2 was positive in comparison to the initial tumor. Expression of SOX2 became more strongly positive than it was before treatment. The immunohistochemical findings of these markers associated with cancer stem-like cells and/or neuroendocrine differentiation suggest that cancer stem cells play a role in the mechanisms of histological transformation and acquired resistance of ALK rearrangement-positive cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first report to suggest an association between cancer  stem-like cells and histological transformation in ALK rearrangement-positive lung cancer."

There are limited data on what factors predict peritoneal progression and affect the outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate investigate the factors associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis. METHODS: The patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the Department of Medical Oncology and Radiation Sickness, Peking University Third Hospital were eligible for retrospective analysis between August 2010 and August 2018. Clinical factors such as age, gender, histology, pleural effusion and gene mutations with  epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase/ROS proto-oncogene 1  receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR/ALK/ROS1) were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 1.44% (12/836) patients in this study developed peritoneal carcinomatosis and 12 patients with adenocarcinoma had metachronous NSCLC diagnosis and PC. Malignant pleural effusion rates at baseline and at PC diagnosis were separately 50% (6/12) and 100.0% (12/12). Among the 12 patients, 9 patients harbored EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation. The outcome of patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation was significantly better than that of patients without EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation, the mOS1 and mOS2 were separately 26.0 months and 6.0 months versus 10.0 months and 1.5 months (P<0.05). The mOS2 of patients with aggressive treatment after PC diagnosis was 6.0 months, significantly better than 1.0 month of patients with best supportive care (P<0.05). The mOS2 of the patients with angiogenesis inhibitors based-treatment after PC diagnosis was 8.5 months, significantly longer than that of patients with other treatments (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adenocarcinoma and malignant pleural effusion are highly associated  with peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with advanced NSCLC. Aggressive treatment for lung cancer with PC is encouraged when possible. More patients with PC may benefit from the treatment strategies with angiogenesis inhibitors.

Several studies have shown that the  efficacy of pemetrexed in HER2-mutant NSCLC is controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of pemetrexed combined with platinum chemotherapy in patients with HER2-mutant and HER2 wild-type lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The clinical data of 106 cases of EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, KRAS, BRAF, RET and  MET-negative patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients who diagnosed by histopathology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively reviewed. The relationships between HER2 gene status, clinical characteristics and response and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: All of the 106 patients' HER2 status were determined. HER2 mutations occurred in 32 cases (30.2%), no mutations in 74 cases (69.8%). HER2 mutations were common in young, non-smoking and female patients. All patients received first-line pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of patients with HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than those without HER2 mutations (40.6% vs 14.9%, χ²=8.464, P=0.004; 93.8% vs 68.9%, χ²=6.327, P=0.012), and the difference was statistically significant. According to univariate analysis, the PFS was significantly associated with the brain metastases, maintenance chemotherapy and HER2 gene status (P<0.05), but not with age, gender, smoking history, oligometastases, liver metastases and type of platinum (P>0.05). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that HER2 mutation was an independent positive prognostic factor of PFS (P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients with first-line pemetrexed  combined with platinum chemotherapy have greater clinical benefit than HER2 wild-type patients."

The safety profile of lorlatinib was established based on 295 patients who had received the recommended dose of lorlatinib 100 mg  once daily. Adverse events associated with lorlatinib are primarily mild to moderate in severity, with hypercholesterolemia (82.4%), hypertriglyceridemia (60.7%), edema (51.2%), peripheral neuropathy (43.7%), and central nervous system effects (39.7%) among the most frequently reported. These can be effectively managed with dose modification and/or standard supportive medical therapy, as indicated by a low incidence of permanent discontinuations due to adverse reactions. Most patients (81.0%) received at least one lipid-lowering agent. Prescription of supportive therapy should also consider the potential for drug-drug interactions with lorlatinib via engagement of specific CYP450 enzymes. This article summarizes the clinical experience from lorlatinib phase I investigators and was generated from discussion and review of the clinical study  protocol and database to provide an expert consensus opinion on the management of the key adverse reactions reported with lorlatinib, including hyperlipidemia, central nervous system effects, weight increase, edema, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal effects. Overall, lorlatinib 100 mg once daily has a unique  safety profile to be considered when prescribed, based on the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with a second-generation ALK TKI.

","The FLAURA trial established osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), as a viable first-line therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitizing EGFR mutations, namely exon 19 deletion and L858R. In this phase 3 randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of treatment-naïve patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC, osimertinib was compared to standard-of-care EGFR TKIs (i.e., erlotinib or gefinitib) in the first-line setting. Osimertinib demonstrated improvement in median progression-free survival (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; hazard ratio 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.57; p < 0.001) and a more favorable toxicity profile due to its lower affinity for wild-type EGFR. Furthermore, similar to later-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, osimertinib has improved efficacy against brain metastases. Despite this impressive effect, the optimal sequencing  of osimertinib, whether in the first line or as subsequent therapy after the failure of earlier-generation EGFR TKIs, is not clear. Because up-front use of later-generation TKIs may result in the inability to use earlier-generation TKIs, this treatment paradigm must be evaluated carefully. For EGFR mutant NSCLC, considerations include the incidence of T790M resistance mutations, quality of life, whether there is a potential role for earlier-generation TKIs after osimertinib failure, and overall survival. This review explores these issues for  EGFR inhibitors and other molecularly targeted therapies."

However, the pattern of failure and clinical value of radiotherapy in metastatic crizotinib-treated ALK-mutant lung cancer, with or without baseline brain metastases (BBM), are largely unknown. METHODS: Consecutive crizotinib-treated NSCLC patients with adequate imaging and  measurable disease were retrospectively enrolled. Disease progression in original sites (primary/metastatic), new sites, or both, are classified as original failure (OF), distant failure (DF) and ODF, respectively. Progression free survival, from crizotinib initiation to the first disease progression, and from that to the second disease progression, were calculated as PFS1 and PFS2. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. With a median follow up of 22.0 (range, 2.0-72.0) months, 52 patients had crizotinib-treatment failure. The frequencies of OF, ODF, and DF, were 50.0, 26.9, and 23.1%, respectively. Histology, primary tumor size and presence of BBM, were independently associated  with OF, using competing risks analyses. The brain was the most common site of initial disease progression. Patients with BBM had a significant higher possibility developing multiple-progressive lesions in the brain (p = 0.002). Importantly, four of the ten patients who had baseline oligo-metastatic cranial disease but didn't receive upfront brain radiation, developed multiple-progressive disease in the brain. Brain radiation before crizotinib could alter the disease failure patterns and improve PFS1 among patients with BBM (p = 0.006). Extracranial radiation was efficient in controlling symptoms but it  was not associated with PFS1 (p = 0.223), and the majority of patients were eligible for salvage radiotherapy upon disease progression to crizotinib. By the  time of data cut-off, 28 patients had second disease progression, with a median PFS2 of 7.0 (95% CI 5.4-8.6) months and salvage radiotherapy significantly prolonged PFS2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, patients receiving any radiotherapy during their treatment course had a significant longer overall survival (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with baseline oligo-metastatic brain lesions which are suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery, upfront brain radiotherapy provides considerable clinical benefits. While, extracranial radiation may be deferred in  asymptomatic patients with multiple-metastatic lesions."

Mutations in epidermal  growth factor receptor (EGFR), and rearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are targetable in lung cancer, while BRAF mutations have been successfully  targeted in metastatic melanoma. Targeting estrogen receptors, cyclin dependent kinases, and HER2 (Human Epidermal Receptor) have resulted in improvement in survival in breast cancer. Major strides have been made in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma by targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. However, intracranial metastases remain a major hurdle in  the setting of targeted therapies. Traditional treatment options for brain metastases include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Surgery is effective in symptomatic patients with dominant lesions or solitary intracranial metastases, however, recovery time can be prolonged, often requiring an interruption in systemic treatment. WBRT and SRS provide symptomatic relief and local control but data on improving overall survival is limited. Most targeted therapies which provide extracranial control have limited penetration through the blood brain barrier. Given the limited therapeutic options and increasing prevalence of brain metastases, finding new strategies for the management of intracranial metastatic disease is critical. Genomic analysis of brain metastases has led to a better understanding of variations in the driver mutations compared to the primary malignancy. Furthermore, newer generations of targeted agents have shown promising intracranial activity. In this review, we will discuss the major molecular alterations in brain metastases from melanoma, lung, breast, and renal cell carcinoma. We will provide an in-depth review of the completed and ongoing clinical trials of drugs targeting the molecular pathways enriched in brain metastases."

However, the long-term efficacy of EGFR-TKI therapy is limited due to the development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the aberrant alterations of 8 driver genes and the primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in advanced NSCLC patients with activated EGFR mutations. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data from 416 patients with stage III/IV or recurrent NSCLC who received an initial EGFR-TKI treatment, from  April 2004 and March 2011, at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Several genetic alterations associated with the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs, including the alterations in BIM, ALK, KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, MET, IGF1R, and ROS1, were detected  by the routine clinical technologies. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between different groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test. A Cox regression model was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with the PFS and OS. RESULTS: Among the investigated patients, 169 NSCLC patients harbored EGFR-sensitive mutations. EGFR-mutant patients having PTEN deletion had a shorter PFS and OS than those with intact PTEN (P = 0.003 for PFS, and P = 0.034 for OS). In the combined molecular analysis of EGFR signaling pathway and resistance genes, we found that EGFR-mutant patients coexisted with aberrant alterations in  EGFR signaling pathway and those having resistant genes had a statistically poorer PFS than those without such alterations (P < 0.001). A Cox proportional regression model determined that PTEN deletion (HR = 4.29,95% CI = 1.72-10.70) and low PTEN expression (HR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.22-3.13), MET FISH + (HR = 2.83,95% CI = 1.37-5.86) were independent predictors for PFS in patients with EGFR-TKI treatment after adjustment for multiple factor. CONCLUSIONS: We determined that the coexistence of genetic alterations in cancer  genes may explain primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs."

In the training phase, tissue microarrays and LASSO Cox regression analysis were applied to further screen candidate molecules in 189 patients, and we developed a predictive signature. In  the validation phase, one internal cohort and two external cohorts were used to validate our novel prognostic signature. RESULTS: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis based on whole-genome microarrays indicated that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated in driver gene-negative lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway-based gene expression profiles revealed 39 transcripts differentially expressed. Finally, a Wnt/β-catenin pathway-based CSDW signature comprising 4 genes (CTNNB1 or β-catenin, SOX9, DVL3, and Wnt2b) was developed to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in the training cohort. Patients with high-risk scores in the training cohort had shorter overall survival [HR, 10.42;  6.46-16.79; P < 0.001) than patients with low-risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: The CSDW signature is a reliable prognostic tool and may represent genes that are potential drug targets for driver gene-negative lung adenocarcinoma."

METHODS: This retrospective US cohort study used Flatiron Health's longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived database. Patients (≥ 18 years old) diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV aNSCLC, with documented ALK rearrangement and ≥2 visits after January 1, 2011 were followed until February 28, 2016. Patients enrolled on a clinical trial or exposed to ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib or ceritinib were excluded. Treatment patterns, time and type of biomarker testing, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Median age (n = 300) was 62.5 years; 55% female; 48% non-smokers; 8.7% central nervous system (CNS) metastases at diagnosis. Overall, 73% and 86% received their first ALK biomarker test before/at diagnosis, or before/during first-line treatment, respectively. In total, 90.0%, 78.1%, and 74.7% received first-, second-, and third-line therapy, respectively. Most patients received ALK-targeted treatment; 62% received crizotinib, of which 21% reported a dose reduction. Progression was the most common reason for crizotinib (78%) and ceritinib (41%) discontinuation. Median OS was 29.4 months (95% CI =24.7-39.6) overall; 27.1 months (95% CI =22.0-35.0) in patients with CNS metastases, and 36.9 months (95% CI =25.1-not reached) without. CONCLUSIONS: Despite widespread crizotinib use in patients with ALK+ aNSCLC, a high proportion of patients progressed. Ongoing analyses of EHR-derived cohorts are valuable in assessing real-world testing rates and therapeutic use of ALK inhibitors."

Although ceritinib or lorlatinib was shown to be effective to these resistant mutants, further resistance often emerges due to ALK-compound mutations in relapse patients following the use of ceritinib or lorlatinib. However, the drug for overcoming resistance has not been established yet. METHODS: We established lorlatinib-resistant cells harboring ALK-I1171N or -G1202R compound mutations by performing ENU mutagenesis screening or using an in vivo mouse model. We performed drug screening to overcome the lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutations. To evaluate these resistances in silico, we developed a modified computational molecular dynamic simulation (MP-CAFEE). FINDINGS: We identified 14 lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutants, including several mutants that were recently discovered in lorlatinib-resistant patients. Some of these compound mutants were found to be sensitive to early generation ALK-TKIs and several BCR-ABL inhibitors. Using our original computational simulation, we succeeded in demonstrating a clear linear correlation between binding free energy and in vitro experimental IC50 value of several ALK-TKIs to single- or compound-mutated EML4-ALK expressing Ba/F3 cells and in recapitulating the tendency of the binding affinity reduction by double mutations found in this  study. Computational simulation revealed that ALK-L1256F single mutant conferred  resistance to lorlatinib but increased the sensitivity to alectinib. INTERPRETATION: We discovered lorlatinib-resistant multiple ALK-compound mutations and an L1256F single mutation as well as the potential therapeutic strategies for these ALK mutations. Our original computational simulation to calculate the binding affinity may be applicable for predicting resistant mutations and for overcoming drug resistance in silico.

We previously found that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) restricts lorlatinib brain accumulation and that the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) limits its oral availability. Using genetically modified mouse models, we investigated the impact of targeted pharmacological inhibitors on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. Upon oral administration of lorlatinib, the plasma AUC0-8h in CYP3A4-humanized mice was ∼1.8-fold lower than  in wild-type and Cyp3a-/- mice. Oral coadministration of the CYP3A inhibitor ritonavir caused reversion to the AUC0-8h levels seen in wild-type and Cyp3a-/- mice, without altering the relative tissue distribution of lorlatinib. Moreover,  simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 with oral elacridar and ritonavir in CYP3A4-humanized mice profoundly increased lorlatinib  brain concentrations, but not its oral availability or other relative tissue distribution. Oral lorlatinib pharmacokinetics was not significantly affected by  absence of the multispecific Oatp1a/1b drug uptake transporters. The absolute oral bioavailability of lorlatinib over 8 h in wild-type, Cyp3a-/-, and CYP3A4-humanized mice was 81.6%, 72.9%, and 58.5%, respectively. Lorlatinib thus  has good oral bioavailability, which is markedly restricted by human CYP3A4 but not by mouse Cyp3a. Pharmacological inhibition of CYP3A4 reversed these effects,  and simultaneous P-gp inhibition with elacridar boosted absolute brain levels of  lorlatinib by 16-fold without obvious toxicity. These insights may help to optimize the clinical application of lorlatinib."

Treatment with ALK inhibitors is recognized as the standard-of-care for patients  with ALK gene rearrangements, but it is important to appropriately select patients who will benefit from such treatment. Areas covered: In this article, we review the evidence regarding ALK testing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the representative methods for detecting ALK gene fusions. Among these diagnostic modalities, IHC in particular exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ALK fusions when appropriately applied and interpreted. Expert commentary: Discrepancies have been reported between the results of IHC and FISH. However, it was revealed that patients with  IHC-positivity and FISH-negativity may respond to alectinib, indicating that IHC  can be used as a stand-alone method from a clinical standpoint for the identification of patients eligible for treatment with ALK inhibitors. In addition, differences between ALK variants have been reported to affect the prognosis and efficacy of ALK inhibitor-based treatments, and RT-PCR will likely  increase in importance as a complementary tool."

Expert commentary: Lorlatinib is a new, reversible, ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor of ALK  and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1). It can inhibit tumor cell growth in ALK- and ROS1-overexpressing tumor cells. Clinical trial indicated that lorlatinib had obvious therapeutic effect for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Lorlatinib could also pass through the blood-brain barrier, which had a good effect on patients with brain metastasis. Adverse events of lorlatinib were mostly mild and moderate in severity, and patients were easily tolerated. Most common adverse events were  edema, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive effects, dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, arthralgia, mood effects, and diarrhea."

We report an updated OS and tolerability analysis, including analyses adjusting for potential bias introduced by crossover from chemotherapy to pembrolizumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (for up to 2 years) or investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy (four to six cycles). Patients assigned to chemotherapy could cross  over to pembrolizumab upon meeting eligibility criteria. The primary end point was progression-free survival; OS was an important key secondary end point. Crossover adjustment analysis was done using the following three methods: simplified two-stage method, rank-preserving structural failure time, and inverse probability of censoring weighting. RESULTS: Three hundred five patients were randomly assigned (pembrolizumab, n = 154; chemotherapy, n = 151). At data cutoff (July 10, 2017; median follow-up, 25.2 months), 73 patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 96 in the chemotherapy arm had died. Median OS was 30.0 months (95% CI, 18.3 months to not reached) with pembrolizumab and 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.8 to 19.0 months) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.86). Eighty-two patients assigned to chemotherapy crossed over on study to receive pembrolizumab. When adjusted for crossover using the two-stage method, the hazard ratio for OS for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.69); results using rank-preserving structural failure time and inverse probability of censoring weighting were similar. Treatment-related grade 3 to 5 adverse events were less frequent with pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy (31.2% v 53.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: With prolonged follow-up, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy continues to demonstrate an OS benefit over chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated, advanced NSCLC without EGFR/ALK aberrations, despite crossover from the control arm to pembrolizumab as subsequent therapy."

Methods: Biopsy records of 196 malignant lung lesions were reviewed. Core obtained from each needle pass was put in a separate container for individual pathological analysis. Types of molecular analysis attempted and their success rates were recorded for each patient. We categorized each patient into one of six groups according to the number of cores (n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4, n=5, n≥6) acquired,  and diagnostic sensitivity for histopathologic diagnosis was calculated for each  core in each group. In order to assess the increase in cumulative sensitivity up  to 4th core, the data from 1st to 4th needle passes in 4-, 5-, and ≥6-core groups were pooled and cumulative diagnostic sensitivities up to 4th core were calculated. Results: Of 196 cases of lung malignancies, five different types of molecular studies (EGFR mutation, ALK translocation, KRAS mutation, RET and ROS1 rearrangements) were attempted with PCNB specimens in 100 cases and successfully  done in 96 cases (96.0%). In ≥4-core group (4-, 5-, and ≥6-core groups combined;  n=148), cumulative sensitivity increased from 83.8% to 89.9% between 1st and 2nd  cores, 89.9% to 93.2% between 2nd and 3rd cores, and 93.2% to 94.6% between 3rd and 4th cores. Conclusions: The cumulative diagnostic sensitivity for the histopathologic diagnosis increases significantly between the second and fourth sampling. Multiple samples obtained with a 20-guage coaxial needle are adequate and have a  high success rate for various molecular studies for lung malignancy."

Results were validated using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We found a novel ROS1 rearrangement form, namely a WNK1-ROS1 fusion. The transmembrane and kinase domains of ROS1 remained intact in this fusion. No EGFR, MET, KRAS, ALK, ROS1 or other NSCLC driver mutations were detected in the patient. The patient achieved a partial response after treatment with crizotinib. When disease progressed, ROS1 G2032R mutation-a classical mechanism of crizotinib resistance-was detected in the DNA sample extracted from the patient's plasma sample. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel WNK1-ROS1 fusion that was sensitive to crizotinib and developed an ROS1 G2032R mutation when the disease progressed.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 598 patients with lung ADC in our institution between January 2014 and December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. We evaluated the incidence of BM by stage and genetic alterations. RESULTS: Of the 598 patients, 97 (16.2%) had BM, which occurred across all stages. The incidence of BM showed a tendency to increase as the stage increased  (p < 0.001, trend test). Although patients with EGFR mutations had BM across all  stages, those with ALK or K- mutations had BM only in stage III and IV diseases.  Regardless of types of mutations, the incidence of BM showed a tendency to increase as the T or N staging increased (p < 0.001 for each of EGFR, ALK, and K-RAS mutations, trend test). Whereas BM incidence showed a tendency to increase  as the M staging increased in patients with EGFR-mutant lung ADC (p < 0.001, trend test), there was no linear trend between M staging and ALK (p = 0.469, trend test) or K-RAS mutations (p = 0.066, trend test). After adjusting covariables, EGFR mutations were associated with BM in never-smokers (adjusted OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.02-4.34) and K-RAS mutations were risk factors for BM in males (adjusted OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 1.01-14.43). CONCLUSIONS: BM occurred in approximately 16% of lung ADC patients, including 3%  with stage I diseases.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old woman with a no-smoking history visited hospital  in November 2016 because of a persistent cough, expectoration, and progressive dysphagia for 2 months. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: She was diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma,  accompanied by pleural and bone metastases. After receiving chemotherapy for nearly 1 year, she showed progressive disease. DNA-sequencing identified an intergenic ALK rearrangement. Surprisingly, RNA-sequencing revealed the EML4-ALK  fusion transcript. Subsequently, this patient switched to crizotinib therapy. OUTCOMES: The patient achieved partial response after 1-month treatment. However, this patient suffered a severe sinus bradycardia after 4 months of treatment. When reducing the dose of crizotinib, the side effect was alleviated and this patient showed stable disease until now. LESSONS: Given that the severe sinus bradycardia was an unusual adverse effect, physicians should be aware of these side effects when using crizotinib. Moreover, it should be noted that this patient harbored an intergenic ALK rearrangement identified by DNA-sequencing, but EML4-ALK fusion transcript verified by RNA-sequencing.

Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement are usually mutually exclusive, EGFR and ALK co-alterations have been reported increasingly in cases of NSCLC. However, the optimal treatment for these cases has not been established. PATIENT CONCERNS: This case series describes three patients diagnosed with advanced non-squamous NSCLC who harbored EGFR and ALK co-alterations. The complaints for each case are as follows: 57-year-old woman with coughing and dyspnea in case 1, 32-year-old man with diplopia in case 2 and 77-year-old woman  with chest discomfort in case 3. DIAGNOSES: Three never-smokers were diagnosed pathologically with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. Subsequent molecular studies revealed the EGFR L858R  mutation gene and ALK rearrangement, which were proven by real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: All 3 patients received first-line therapy with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Cases 1 and 2 were treated with ALK-TKIs as second-line therapy and received additional EGFR-TKIs as third- and fourth-line regimens. OUTCOMES: The patients achieved partial responses to EGFR-TKIs according to radiologic findings. However, second-line ALK-TKI therapy was ineffective in cases 1 and 2. LESSONS: Cases of NSCLC with concomitant EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement are  rare, and the selection of an optimal targeted therapy is challenging. Here, EGFR-TKI appeared to yield better outcomes than ALK-TKI in patients with NSCLC who harbored EGFR/ALK co-alterations."

The presence of the 4q12 amplicon causes the activation of downstream mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (c-Kit) or platelet-derived  growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) signaling pathways. Therefore, in the present study, the association between the functional proteins phosphorylated c-Kit (p-c-Kit) and phosphorylated PDGFRA (p-PDGFRA) and the prognosis of ALK fusion NSCLC was investigated. Advanced stage NSCLC samples with ALK fusion were tested  for their p-c-Kit and p-PDGFRA content by immunohistochemical staining, and for its association with crizotinib efficacy and the survival of the patients. Of 64  eligible ALK-positive patients with NSCLC, 30 (46.9%) were p-c-Kit-positive and 10 (15.7%) were p-PDGFRA-positive. Brain metastases were more common in ALK-positive cases that were p-PDGFRA-positive compared with those who were p-PDGFRA-negative. ALK-positive patients treated with crizotinib, who exhibited high levels of p-c-Kit had significantly lower progression-free survival times than those with low levels. In addition, the patients with high levels of p-c-Kit exhibited lower overall survival times than those with low levels. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that high levels of p-c-Kit in patients with ALK  fusion was the only significant predictive factor for crizotinib efficacy and was a prognostic factor for poor overall survival time. However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the survival of patients with different p-PDGFRA levels. p-PDGFRA was more frequently expressed in the ALK-positive cases with brain metastasis. c-Kit signaling activation may be associated with poor efficacy of crizotinib and poor prognosis in advanced ALK fusion NSCLC."

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profiles of several mucins in ALK + lung cancers to gain insight into  the relationship between the more aggressive biological nature of ALK + lung cancers and the role of mucins. We examined the immunohistochemical profiles of mucins MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 in 19 ALK + lung cancers compared with 42 EGFR-mutated lung cancers. ALK + cancers were found to occur in younger patients  and were characterized by a solid-predominant histologic subtype with frequent signet ring cells and peritumoral muciphages. By contrast, EGFR-mutated cancers lacked ALK-specific histological patterns. Although all MUC1 and MUC5AC were expressed in both subtypes, MUC1 expression in ALK + cancers was visualized exclusively through cytoplasmic staining, whereas those in EGFR-mutated cancers were predominantly membranous staining in apical area (92.9%) and focally in cytoplasmic staining (7.1%). MUC5AC expression in ALK + cancers was exclusively visualized through cytoplasmic staining (100%), whereas EGFR-mutated cancers showed predominantly perinuclear dot-like patterns (90.5%) and focal cytoplasmic  staining (9.5%). MUC2 and MUC6 expression was not detected in either type of lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of both MUC1 and MUC5AC cytoplasmic expression, coupled with a lack of MUC2 and MUC6 expression in ALK + lung cancer  may contribute to the biologically aggressive behavior of ALK + cancer. Inhibitors to these types of mucins may thus act as a barrier to cancerous extension reducing their aggressive behavior."

The choice of molecular testing in a clinical setting is influenced by cost, expertise in the technology, instrumentation setup and sample type availability. The molecular techniques described in this review include immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in situ  hybridization, direct sequencing, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing (NGS). IHC is routinely used in clinical practice for the classification, differentiation, histology and identification of targetable alterations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Recently, the PD-L1 pathway was identified as being exploited by tumour cells, allowing immune resistance and tumour evasion. The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors as treatment for  tumours expressing checkpoints has highlighted the need for standardized IHC assays to inform treatment decisions for patients. Direct sequencing was historically the gold standard for mutation testing for EGFR, KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue) and BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1) requiring a high ratio of tumour to normal cells, but this has been superseded by more sensitive methods. NGS is a new emerging technique, which allows high-throughput coverage of frequently mutated genes, including less common BRAF and MET mutations and alterations in tumour suppressor genes. When an NGS platform is unavailable, PCR-based technologies offer an efficient and cost-effective single gene test to guide patient treatment. This article will review these techniques and discuss the future of molecular platforms underpinning clinical management decisions."

Epub 2019 Jan 24.","Developing a New qPCR-Based System for Screening Mutation.","An accurate genotyping analysis is one of the critical prerequisites for lung cancer targeted therapy. Here, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based mutation detection system, mutation-selected amplification-specific  system PCR (MASS-PCR), is developed. The specific primers and probes used in MASS-PCR exactly match with the mutant sequence that only allows mutant gene to emit the fluorescence peak. To determine the sensitivity of MASS-PCR, 717 lung cancer specimens, 61 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, and 656 fresh reaction tissues are collected and undergo mutation detection of lung cancer driver genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER2, MET, ALK, and ROS1). These samples are divided into two groups. Mutations in Group I, which has 631 fresh reaction tissues, are analyzed by MASS-PCR and the amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR). While group II samples, 25 fresh reaction tissues and 61 FFPE tissues, are screened through MASS-PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS). All results are verified by direct sequencing. MASS-PCR shows high consistency with ARMS-PCR (kappa value > 0.733) and NGS (kappa value = 0.79) (P < 0.001). For the samples with inconsistent MASS-PCR and ARMS-PCR results, DS results more likely support the MASS-PCR results. These data suggest that MASS-PCR is a convenient, accurate, and economical method for the detection of lung cancer driver gene mutations in clinical practice."

This makes ALK an attractive target for cancer therapy. Since ALK⁻driven tumors are dependent for their proliferation on the constitutively activated ALK kinase, a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to block tumor growth. While some inhibitors are under investigation in clinical trials, others are now  approved for treatment, notably in ALK-positive lung cancer. Their efficacy is remarkable, however limited in time, as the tumors escape and become resistant to the treatment through different mechanisms. Hence, there is a pressing need to target ALK-dependent tumors by other therapeutic strategies, and possibly use them in combination with kinase inhibitors. In this review we will focus on the therapeutic potential of proapoptotic ALK-derived peptides based on the dependence receptor properties of ALK. We will also try to make a non-exhaustive  list of several alternative treatments targeting ALK-dependent and independent signaling pathways."

[Epub ahead of print]","Relevance of Detection of Mechanisms of Resistance to ALK Inhibitors in ALK-Rearranged NSCLC in Routine Practice.","BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown efficacy in the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the disease eventually progresses in all patients. In many cases, resistance to ALK TKIs arises through ALK mutations. Although clinical and biological data suggest variations in TKI efficacy according to the mechanism of  resistance, ALK mutations are still rarely investigated in routine practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentric study with an aim to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of ALK alterations detected using targeted next-generation sequencing in patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC after progression during an ALK TKI treatment. Data on clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics and patient outcomes were collected. RESULTS: We identified 23 patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC who, between January 2012 and May 2017, had undergone at least 1 repeat biopsy at progression during an ALK TKI treatment. A resistance mechanism was identified in 9 of the 23 patients (39%). The anomalies involved included 9 ALK mutations in 8  patients and one ALK amplification. The ALK mutation rate was 15% after failure of a first ALK TKI and 33% after failure of 2 ALK TKI treatments. Five of 7 patients who received a different ALK TKI after detection of an ALK mutation achieved an objective response. All of the patients who received a TKI presumed to act on the detected ALK mutant achieved disease control. CONCLUSION: Targeted next-generation sequencing is suitable for detecting ALK resistance mutations in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients in routine practice. It might help select the best treatment at the time of disease progression during treatment with an ALK TKI."

Although fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry have been established as gold standard methods, next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms are called to be at  least equally successful. Comparison of these methods for translation into daily  use is currently under investigation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty non-small-cell lung cancer paraffin-embedded samples  with previous ALK (n = 33) and ROS1 (n = 7) FISH results were examined with the Oncomine Focus Assay and tested for ALK and ROS1 immunoreactivity. Clinical implications of concurrent molecular alterations and concordance between methods  were evaluated. RESULTS: NGS was successful in 32 (80%) cases: 25 ALK and 7 ROS1. Few concomitant alterations were detected: 1 ALK rearranged case had an ALK p.L1196M-resistant mutation, 4 had CDK4, MYC, and/or ALK amplifications, and 1 ROS1 rearranged case  showed a FGFR4 amplification. Comparison between techniques revealed 5 (16%) discordant cases that had lower progression-free survival than concordant cases:  7.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-13) versus 19.4 (95% confidence interval, 10.1-28.6). Remarkably, 4 of these cases had isolated 3' signal FISH pattern (P = .026). CONCLUSION: Our data support that the identification of 3' isolated signal FISH pattern in ALK and ROS1 cases might suggest a false-positive result. NGS seems a  reliable technique to assess ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, offering the advantage  over immunohistochemistry of detecting other molecular alterations with potential therapeutic implications."

Genetic and molecular profiling of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has led to the discovery of actionable oncogenic driver alterations, which has revolutionized treatment for this disease. This review will move beyond traditional mutational drivers such as EGFR and ALK and will instead focus on emerging targets and the efficacy of new precision therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Here, we discuss both established and emerging targeted therapy  approaches, as well as ongoing challenges for the treatment of NSCLC patients harboring oncogenic alterations of the following types-gene fusions (ROS1, RET, NTRK), receptor tyrosine kinases (MET amplification and exon 14 mutations and EGFR/HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations), and MAPK signaling (SHP2 and altered BRAF and NF1). The treatment of lung cancer is increasingly biomarker-driven, as patients are selected for targeted agents based on the identification of genetic  alterations amenable to inhibition. Our ability to further improve patient outcomes with this precision medicine approach will require continued efforts to  identify, characterize, and target lesions driving lung cancer tumorigenesis and  progression."

METHOD: From December 2015 to September 2017, we retrospectively studied 91 patients with peripheral NSCLC who underwent surgery after EBUS-GS. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation status obtained from surgical specimens served as the references. RESULTS: Compared to the reference data, EGFR mutational testing of EBUS-GS specimens was in 97% agreement, and the κ coefficient was 0.931 (P< 0.001). In addition, on ALK translocation testing, the results of all 91 patients were in agreement with the reference data (concordance rate of 100%, κ coefficient 1.000; P< 0.001).

Although more than 15,000 fusion RNAs have been identified from diverse cancer types, few common features have been reported. Here, we compared 16,410 fusion transcripts detected in cancer (from a published cohort of 9,966 tumor samples of 33 cancer types) with genome-wide RNA-DNA interactions mapped in two normal, noncancerous cell types [using iMARGI, an enhanced version of the mapping of RNA-genome interactions (MARGI) assay]. Among the top 10 most significant RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells, 5 colocalized with the gene pairs that formed fusion RNAs in cancer. Furthermore, throughout the genome, the frequency of a gene pair to exhibit RNA-DNA interactions is positively correlated with the probability of this gene pair to present documented fusion transcripts in cancer. To test whether RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells are predictive of fusion RNAs, we analyzed these in a validation cohort of 96 lung cancer samples using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Thirty-seven of 42 fusion transcripts in the validation cohort were found to exhibit RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells.

Angiogenesis inhibitors have been used in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line and maintenance settings providing improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), as well as overall survival (OS) in selected studies. Biologic rationale exists for combining anti-angiogenic agents with immunotherapy and targeted kinase inhibitors (TKIs). A recent study has demonstrated improved survival when anti-PD-L1 therapy was added to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Subgroup analysis of patients with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene also demonstrated benefit with combined anti-PD-L1, bevacizumab, and platinum chemotherapy. Further investigation into combination therapy is warranted in the EGFR- and ALK-positive population given this signal. Anti-angiogenics combined with EGFR-targeted treatment in the wild-type population have shown modest PFS benefit with no OS benefit, and their routine use has not been adopted. The combination of EGFR inhibitors plus vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors in the EGFR mutation-positive population has demonstrated substantial improvements in response and PFS; however, given the higher toxicity and lack of survival benefit to date, combination therapy in this group should be used with caution. At the present time, use of bevacizumab can be recommended with atezolizumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC patients. Data with other checkpoint inhibitors and anti-angiogenics are too early to make firm recommendations regarding their use."

There has been a greater role for medical therapies in the last two decades due to the discovery of driver mutations and corresponding targeted therapies. These innovations have dramatically altered the approach to treating these patients. Some of the important mutations include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations in small cell lung cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) mutation in breast cancer,  and BRAF mutation in melanoma. Disease-specific graded prognostic assessments have identified prognostic factors for each of the major tumor types associated with BM. These reflect the increased treatment sensitivity of these tumors to specific agents. Furthermore, there is a difference in the genetic makeup of BM compared to their primary tumor. Genomic studies of BM patients comparing somatic point mutations and copy number variations with their primary tumor have demonstrated that while both the primary tumor and BM share a number of common mutations, BM can often develop distinct mutations. Therefore, there is a need to individualize systemic therapies in BM. Several organizations including the Food  and Drug Administration and the American Society of Clinical Oncology now emphasize the inclusion of BM patients in various phases of clinical drug development."

The aim of the study was to  analyze the EGFR, KRAS, ALK, RET, ROS1, BRAF, ERBB2, MET and PIK3CA mutational status in a representative cohort of Swiss patients with lung adenocarcinoma and  to correlate the mutational status with clinicopathological patient characteristics. METHODS: All patients who underwent molecular testing of newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma during a 4-year period (2014-2018) were included. Molecular analyses were performed with Sanger sequencing (n = 158) and next generation sequencing (n = 311). ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion gene analyses were also performed  with fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the medical records. RESULTS: Of 469 patients with informative EGFR mutation analyses, 90 (19.2%) had  EGFR mutations. KRAS mutations were present in 33.9% of the patients, while 6.0%  of patients showed ALK rearrangement. BRAF, ERBB2, MET and PIK3CA mutations and ROS1 and RET rearrangements were found in 2.6%, 1.9%, 1.9%, 1.5%, 1.7% and 0.8% of the patients, respectively. EGFR mutation was significantly associated with female gender and never smoking status. ALK translocations were more frequent in  never smokers, while KRAS mutations were more commonly found in ever smokers. The association between KRAS mutational status and female gender was statistically significant only on multivariate analysis after adjusting for smoking. CONCLUSION: The EGFR mutation rate in the current study is among the higher previously reported mutation rates, while the frequencies of KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2 and PIK3CA mutations and ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements are similar to the results of previous reports. EGFR and KRAS mutations were significantly associated with gender and smoking. ALK rearrangements showed a significant association with smoking status alone."

They affect children more than adults. The most common sites of involvement are the lung, soft tissue, peritoneum, bladder, and less commonly the gynecologic tract. IMTs are characterized by spindle to epithelioid cells with myofibroblastic differentiation, some degree of smooth muscle differentiation, myxoid stroma and usually associated with brisk lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. In about half of the cases, IMTs are associated with rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene located at chromosome 2p23. The ALK rearrangement can be detected by immunohistochemistry for ALK protein expression (mostly cytoplasmic with or without perinuclear accentuation) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using dual-color break-apart probes for which the typical pattern is seen as split 3' end (red) and 5' end (green) probe signals in addition to single normal, unsplit red-green  signal pair (yellow). Herein we describe a case of uterine IMT initially misdiagnosed intraoperatively as leiomyoma which showed sparse lymphocytic infiltrates, positive ALK expression by immunohistochemistry, a predominantly atypical FISH signal pattern (1 yellow and 1 red signal only) and few typical signal patterns (1 yellow, 1 red, and 1 green signal) in a smaller population of  tumor cells. The RNA sequencing showed a recently described DES-ALK fusion transcript in the tumor cells, suggesting an intrachromosomal inversion and deletion as the likely underlying mechanism for the atypical FISH pattern. Familiarity with the unusual morphology and atypical FISH pattern is crucial given that this tumor has an activating ALK rearrangement and may benefit from targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the future."

We have analyzed the clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with inadequate tumor samples for tissue genotyping. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted the study in a multi-institutional prospective cohort of clinically unselected patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinomas with insufficient tissue for EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genotyping across 12 Spanish institutions (n = 93). ctDNA NGS was carried out by Guardant Health (Guardant360, Redwood City, CA), using a hybrid-capture-based 73-gene panel. Variants were deemed actionable if they were part of the OncoKB precision oncology knowledge database and classified in four levels of actionability based on their clinical or preclinical evidence for drug response. RESULTS: Eighty-three out of 93 patients (89%) had detectable levels of ctDNA. Potentially actionable level 1-4 genomic alterations were detected in 53 cases (57%), of which 13 (14%) had level 1-2A alterations (Food and Drug Administration-approved and standard-care biomarkers according to lung cancer guidelines). Frequencies of each genomic alteration in ctDNA were consistent with those observed in unselected pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The majority of the patients (62%), particularly those with actionable alterations (87%), had more than one pathogenic variant in ctDNA. The median turnaround time to genomic results was 13 days. Twelve patients (13%) received genotype-matched therapies based on ctDNA results, deriving the expected clinical benefit. Patients with co-occurring pathogenic alterations had a significantly shorter median overall survival as compared with patients without co-occurring pathogenic alteration (multivariate hazard ratio = 5.35, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Digital NGS of ctDNA in lung cancers with insufficient tumor samples  for tissue sequencing detects actionable variants that frequently co-occur with other potentially clinically relevant genomic alterations, allowing timely initiation of genotype-matched therapies.  © The Author(s) 2018.

Eight cases failed because of low cellularity, whereas  257 of 265 cases had sufficient material for ALK FISH study. Nine of 257 cases (3.5%) revealed ALK rearrangement by FISH. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that cytological specimens can yield  sufficient material for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement test. Our study reveals that 8.6% of EGFR mutation rate and 3.5% of ALK rearrangement rate in the cytology specimens from the patients with primary or metastatic lung non-small cell carcinoma."

In recent years,  molecular testing has been developed to study genetic mutations in NSCLC. There are studies revealing improved survival in advanced NSCLC using targeted therapy  as the first-line treatment in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of EBUS-TBNA in providing adequate size specimens for EGFR, ALK and ROS1 genetic mutation analysis in patients with adenocarcinoma or not otherwise specified (NOS) lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Charts of patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma or NOS via EBUS-TBNA were retrospectively reviewed. Information on patient demographics, number of lymph nodes sampled, their size and location, targeted gene mutations and the adequacy of the material sampled for the molecular testing was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included in the study, adenocarcinoma 86 (75%) and NOS 28 (25%). EGFR gene mutation was studied in all of the patients included in the study while ALK in 113 and ROS1 in 98. The material adequacy ratios for EGFR gene mutation, ALK and ROS1 rearrangements were found to be 88.6%, 93.8% and 91.8%, respectively. EGFR gene mutation, ALK and ROS1 rearrangements were found positive in 13 (11.4%), 9 (8%) and 1 (1%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that EBUS-TBNA provides adequate material for  mutation analysis in patients with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma or NOS lung cancer."

Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are known to have peculiar toxicity profile, hence, increasing awareness to the safety profile of ALK inhibitors is essential. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review of literature has been conducted to include prospective trials that used the ALK inhibitors Crizotinib, Ceritinib, Alectinib, Brigatinib and Lorlatinib in patients with advanced NSCLC and have available efficacy and toxicity results. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies including 2793 patients were considered eligible for our review and included two phase IB, seven phase II and five phase III studies. The most common adverse events (AEs) observed with ALK inhibitors were gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities as nausea (up to 83%), vomiting (up to 67%) and  diarrhea (up to 86%), elevation of liver enzymes occurred in up to 60% and fatigue (up to 43%). There were differences in the toxicity patterns between the  different ALK inhibitors with more GI and hepatic toxicities with Ceritinib, more visual disorders with Crizotinib, more dysgeusia with crizotinib and Alectinib and possibly more respiratory complications with Brigatinib. Most of the AEs were low grade and treatment-related deaths were associated with ALK inhibitors in 0-1% of patients. CONCLUSION: Most of adverse effects of ALKi can be managed efficiently via dose modifications or interruptions. Timely identification of each ALKi pattern of toxicity can prevent treatment-related morbidity and mortality in this palliative setting."

Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 (STK1 or  FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246). Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 signalling in cells expressing FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), tyrosine kinase domain mutation FLT3-D835Y and the double mutant FLT3-ITD-D835Y, thereby inducing apoptosis. Gilteritinib also binds to and inhibits the wild-type and mutated forms of ALK, resulting in reduced tumour cell proliferation in cancer cell types that overexpress the mutation. Gilteritinib is approved in Japan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation. Recently, it was also approved in the USA for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory AML with a FLT3 mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. Clinical development of gilteritinib is underway in several countries worldwide. Development for non-small cell lung cancer and solid tumours has been discontinued."

A critical limitation of conventional ALK/ROS TKIs is their association with acquired resistance mutations (particularly ALK G1202R and ROS1 G2032R) in the ALK or ROS1 gene, although these are not the only resistance  mechanisms. Another limitation of this class of drugs is their inadequate efficacy against central nervous system metastasis, likely attributable to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, lorlatinib was developed to overcome these  limitations by being more potent, selective and permeable to the BBB than previous-generation ALK/ROS1 TKIs and subsequently received breakthrough therapy  designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2017. In September 2018, Japan became the first country where lorlatinib received approval for treating patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.

However, he experienced recurrence of a bulbar metastasis after discontinuation of alectinib. Reintroduction of standard-dose alectinib therapy resolved the lesion again. Our findings suggest that ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy should be continued in patients showing a long-term complete response, unless intolerable toxicities are present, and that  rechallenge treatment with alectinib may represent a therapeutic option for central nervous system metastases."

Here, we evaluated relationships between clinically significant crizotinib-associated AEs and germline variations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA obtained from 75 patients allowed selection of 147 genes according to function, exon identification and sequencing, and determination of germline single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Correlations between clinically significant AEs and presence of germline variants were estimated by Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: We defined clinically significant AEs as grade 4 hematological toxicity, grade ≥3 non-hematological toxicity, and any grade of ILD. These AEs were observed in 26 patients (35%), with elevated AST/ALT (15%) the most common, followed by neutropenia (5%), ILD (4%), and thromboembolic events (4%). Nonsynonymous SNVs in epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) [odds ratio (OR): 3.86; p = 0.0009) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) (OR: 2.51; p = 0.025) were associated with the presence of clinically significant AEs. CONCLUSION: Nonsynonymous EPHX1 and TCF7L2 SNVs might be associated with clinically significant crizotinib-associated AEs. These data indicated that target-gene sequencing could be feasible for predicting anticancer-agent toxicity, and that germline multi-gene information might be useful for predicting patient-specific AEs to promote precision medicine."

As a central player in TGF-β signal transduction, SMAD4 (also known as DPC4) is frequently mutated or deleted in gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer. However, such genetic alterations are rare in most cancer types and the underlying mechanism for TGF-β resistance is not understood. Here we describe a mechanism of TGF-β resistance in ALK-positive tumours, including lymphoma, lung cancer and neuroblastoma. We demonstrate that, in ALK-positive tumours, ALK directly phosphorylates SMAD4 at Tyr 95. Phosphorylated SMAD4 is unable to bind to DNA and fails to elicit TGF-β gene responses and tumour suppressing responses. Chemical or genetic interference of the oncogenic ALK restores TGF-β responses in ALK-positive tumour cells. These findings reveal that SMAD4 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by an oncogenic tyrosine kinase during tumorigenesis. This suggests a mechanism by which SMAD4 is inactivated in cancers and provides guidance for targeted therapies in ALK-positive cancers."

ALK is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p23) and exchange of chromosomal segments with other genes, including nucleophosmin (NPM), echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) and Trk-fused gene (TFG), readily occurs. Such chromosomal translocation results in the formation of chimeric X-ALK fusion oncoproteins, which possess potential oncogenic functions due to constitutive activation of ALK kinase. These proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies and solid tumors, including lymphoma, lung cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs), Spitz tumors,  renal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, digestive tract cancer, breast cancer, leukemia  and ovarian carcinoma. Targeting of ALK fusion oncoproteins exclusively, or in combination with ALK kinase inhibitors including crizotinib, is the most common therapeutic strategy. As is often the case for small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), drug resistance eventually develops via an adaptive secondary  mutation in the ALK fusion oncogene, or through engagement of alternative signaling mechanisms. The updated mechanisms of a variety of ALK fusions in tumorigenesis, proliferation and metastasis, in addition to targeted therapies are discussed below."

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a sensitive and specific method to detect ALK protein expression, possibly an alternative to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, the concordance of FISH and IHC to determine ALK status was evaluated, particularly focusing on discordant cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ALK status was tested by FISH and the IHC validated method (Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay) in 95 NSCLCs. Discordant cases were analyzed also  by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The response to crizotinib of treated patients was recorded. RESULTS: Seven (7.3%) discordant cases were ALK FISH positive and IHC negative. They showed coexistent split signals pattern, with mean percentage of 15.4%, and  5' deletions pattern, with mean percentage 31.7%. Two cases had also gene amplification pattern. In three cases (42.8 %), the polysomy was observed. The NGS assay confirmed IHC results. In these patients, the treatment with crizotinib was ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: In our discordant cases, a coexistent complex pattern (deleted, split, and amplified/polysomic) of ALK gene was observed by FISH analysis. These  complex rearranged cases were not detectable by IHC, and it could be speculated that more complex biological mechanisms could modulate protein expression. These  data highlight the role of IHC and underscore the complexity of the genetic pattern of ALK. It could be crucial to consider these findings in order to best select patients for anti-ALK treatment in daily clinical practice."

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old woman with stage IV ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC presented with acute neck pain, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness 15 days post discontinuation of alectinib. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with  contrast was significant for a new compressive lesion spanning the entire cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, which was new compared with MRI obtained 20 days before and was suspicious for infection. Cervical (C3-C7), thoracic (T9-T12), and lumbar (L3-L5) decompression were performed with collection of culture and pathology specimens. Repeat MRI obtained for acute neurologic deterioration on postoperative day 2 noted further progression of disease and continued thoracic cord compression. After urgent T1-9 laminectomy, specimens were again sent for pathology, cultures, and cytology. No evidence of infection was noted, and all pathologic specimens evaluated were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Despite operative intervention, the patient continued to decline, suffering from recurrent pleural effusions, and eventual cardiopulmonary arrest 11 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: The differential diagnosis when evaluating presumed spine epidural abscess should include tumor and metastatic disease, even in cases of rapid development. Recent termination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or ALK inhibitors may result in severe disease flares, and a history of such should raise clinical  suspicion for metastatic progression. In addition to cultures, biopsy for pathologic diagnosis should be collected during decompressive surgery."

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether tumor mutation status (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1,  and BRAF) and treatment history were associated with survival after neurosurgery. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic health records of 104 patients with NSCLC with genomic profiling who underwent neurosurgical resection for symptomatic brain metastases at an academic institution between January 2000 and January 2018. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate the association between overall survival (OS) after neurosurgery and clinicopathologic factors, including mutation status. RESULTS: Mean age of patients in this study was 61 (±12) years, and 44% were men. The median OS after neurosurgery was 24 months (95% confidence interval, 18-34 months). Our multivariate analysis showed that the presence of an EGFR mutation in the tumor was significantly associated with improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.214; P = 0.029), independent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor use. Presence of KRAS, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF alterations was not associated with survival (all P > 0.05). Conversely, older age (HR, 1.039; P = 0.029), a history of multiple brain  irradiation procedures (HR, 9.197; P < 0.001), and presence of extracranial metastasis (HR, 2.556; P = 0.016) resulted in increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients requiring surgical resection of an epidermal growth factor  receptor-mutated NSCLC brain metastasis had an associated improved survival compared with patients without this mutation, independent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor use. Decreased survival was associated with older age, multiple previous brain radiation therapies, and extracranial metastasis."

Crizotinib is very effective in ROS1-positive patients and is now Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC. We report our experience in a tertiary cancer care hospital in India in ROS-1 positive patients. Materials and method: The present series is a retrospective analysis of 22 patients from the prospectively maintained lung cancer audit. Demographic data were collected which included age, performance status, gender, stage, co-morbidities, sites of metastasis and smoking history. Data were also collected regarding the source of financing for crizotinib whether self-financed, through insurance or Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) sponsored. Patients who had tested negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and were subsequently found to be ROS1-mutation negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were evaluated on similar lines. All the data were entered and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 22.0. Response evaluation was done by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Results: Between January 2015 and December 2017, there were 22 patients who were  ROS1 positive from a total of 535 patients in whom ROS1 testing was performed. A  total of 16 patients could receive crizotinib and 6 patients were never exposed to crizotinib. Among the 16 patients who received crizotinib, 2 (12.5%) achieved  complete response (CR) as their best response and continue to remain in CR at follow-up. 13 (81%) had a partial response as best response and of which on follow-up 5 (38%) have progressed, while 8 (62%) continue to maintain response. The patients who were on crizotinib had good tolerance with none experiencing any grade 3/4 toxicity. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 15.2 months in  ROS1-positive cohort and 11.4 months in ROS1-negative cohort. In ROS1-positive cohort median, progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached and the estimated  2-year PFS was 54% and in ROS1-negative cohort, it was 5.1 months. The median overall survival of the entire ROS1-positive cohort was not reached and the estimated 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 72% and 54%, respectively, and  was 8.8 months in ROS1-negative cohort. Conclusion: ROS1 rearrangement with an incidence of 4% of lung adenocarcinoma which is EGFR and ALK negative represents an important targetable driver mutation in the Indian population. Crizotinib also represents an effective treatment option with outcomes similar to those reported. Access to treatment remains an important roadblock to improve outcomes but innovative methods may improve access to these drugs."

Whether the sequence in which targeted therapy and chemotherapy are performed matters, is however not known. We examined the impact  of the sequential treatment of targeted therapy and chemotherapy among advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Materials and Methods: Randomized controlled trials comparing the use of ALK inhibitors with chemotherapy were included in this meta-analysis. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from a random effects model. Two-sided statistical tests were used to determine the significance of these estimates. Results: In five eligible studies (1404 patients), ALK targeted therapy, in comparison with chemotherapy, had a significantly higher PFS (HR = 0.48; 95% CI,  0.42⁻0.55), but not significantly higher OS (HR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.72⁻1.07). Crossover from chemotherapy to ALK inhibitors was allowed after progression in all trials. The sensitivity analysis of the use of ALK inhibitors as either the first- or second-line treatment, showed improvements in PFS but not in OS. Conclusions: Our results indicate that using targeted therapy first improved PFS, but that the sequence in which the treatments were performed did not cause a significant difference in overall survival."

Histologically, the tumor morphology is indistinguishable from undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx. It is characterized by nests or diffuse sheets of syncytial tumor cells, which show round to oval vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, along with an admixed heavy lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrate. The presence of Epstein-Barr virus in the tumor cells is crucial for the diagnosis. The differential diagnoses include lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma from other sites  and pulmonary involvement of lymphoma. EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements are  not commonly found in lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma, in contrast to programmed death ligand-1 expression, which is shown in a majority of cases."

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 54 patients harboring ALK rearrangements and 520 patients without ALK rearrangements, and all these patients were treated exclusively by surgery between 2011 and 2016. RESULTS NSE level (P=0.007 for OS) was identified as an independent prognostic factor among patients with resected ALK-positive adenocarcinoma of the lung. CONCLUSIONS A high level of NSE is associated with worse outcome among resected lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring ALK rearrangements."

This study was aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of lung adenosquamous carcinoma. Methods:  The pathological features and follow-up data of 133 patients were collected and the prognostic factors of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. Results:  Among the 133 patients, 81 cases (60.9%) smoked. Among the 62 patients whose percentage of histological components were identified, 45 cases had >50% adenocarcinoma components, and 17 cases had >50% squamous cell carcinoma components. 55 patients had lymph node metastasis at the first visit. All patients accepted at least one test of tumor driven gene mutation, and the results showed that the mutation rate of EGFR was 50.8% (67/132), the mutation rate of K-ras was 8.6% (11/128), the ALK-positive rate was 4.2% (2/48). The gender, smoking status, and the proportion of pathological components were the main influence factors of EGFR mutation status. The median overall survival was 28 months, the rates of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival were 72.9%, 23.3%, and 9.0%, respectively. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment was an independent risk factor for prognose of these patients (P=0.024). Conclusions: Lung adenosquamous carcinoma is a rare subtype with high malignancy and poor prognosis. Early diagnosis and driven-mutation-based individualized therapy may improve the survival of patients with lung adenosquamous carcinoma."

We analysed all stage-IV ALK+ NSCLC patients with longitudinally assessable TP53 status treated in our institutions (n = 62). Patients with TP53 mutations at baseline (TP53mutbas, n = 23) had worse overall survival (OS) than patients with initially wild-type tumours (TP53wtbas, n = 39, 44 vs. 62 months in median, p = 0.018). Within the generally favourable TP53wtbas group, detection of TP53 mutations at progression defined a converted subgroup (TP53mutconv, n = 9) with inferior OS, similar to that of TP53mutbas and shorter than that of patients remaining TP53 wild-type (TP53wtprogr, 45 vs. 94 months, p = 0.043). Progression-free survival (PFS) under treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for TP53mutconv was comparable to that of TP53mutbas and also shorter than that of TP53wtprogr cases  (5 and 8 vs. 13 months, p = 0.0039). Fewer TP53wtprogr than TP53mutbas or TP53mutconv cases presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis (67% vs. 91% or  100%, p < 0.05). Thus, acquisition of TP53 mutations at progression is associated with more aggressive disease, shorter TKI responses and inferior OS in ALK+ NSCLC, comparable to primary TP53 mutated cases."

METHODS: We developed the NanoVelcro Chip integrating three functional mechanisms. NanoVelcro CTC capture efficiency was tested in stage III or IV lung  adenocarcinoma. Further, ALK-rearrangement status was examined through fluorescent in situ hybridization in CTCs enriched by NanoVelcro. RESULTS: NanoVelcro system showed higher CTC-capture efficiency than CellSearch in stage III or IV lung adenocarcinoma. CTC counts obtained by both methods were  positively correlated (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). Further, Correlation between CTC counts and pTNM stage determined by NanoVelcro was more significant than that determined by CellSearch (p < 0.001 VS p = 0.029). All ALK-positive patients had  3 or more ALK-rearranged CTC per ml of blood. Less than 3 ALK-rearranged CTC was  detected in ALK-negative patients. NanoVelcro can detect the ALK-rearranged status with consistent sensitivity and specificity compared to biopsy test. Furthermore, the ALK-rearranged CTC ratio correlated to the pTNM stage in ALK-positive patients. Following up showed that CTCs counting by NanoVelcro was more stable and reliable in evaluating the efficacy of Clozotinib both in the short and long run compared with CellSearch. Changing of NanoVlecro CTC counts could accurately reflect disease progression. CONCLUSION: NanoVelcro provides a sensitive method for CTC counts and characterization in advanced NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement can be detected in CTCs collected from advanced NSCLC patients by NanoVelcro, facilitating diagnostic test and prognosis analysis, most importantly offering one noninvasive method for real-time monitoring of treatment reaction."

Nonetheless tumour consists of heterogeneous cell subpopulations  with diverse phenotypes and genotypes, and cancer cells can actively release extracellular vesicles (EVs) to modulate the phenotype of other cells in the tumour microenvironment. We hypothesized that EVs derived from a drug-resistant subpopulation of cells could induce drug resistance in recipient cells. We have established ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and subclones. The subclones have been characterized and the expression of EV-RNAs determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of EV transfer on drug resistance were examined in vitro. Serum EV-RNA was assayed serially in two patients prescribed ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALK-TKI) treatment. We demonstrated that the EVs from an ALK-TKI-resistant subclone could induce drug resistance in the originally sensitive subclone. EV-RNA profiling revealed that miRNAs miR-21-5p and miR-486-3p, and lncRNAs MEG3 and XIST were differentially expressed in the EVs secreted by the resistant subclones. These circulating EV-RNA levels have been found to correlate with disease progression of EML4-ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma in patients prescribed ALK-TKI treatment. The results from this study suggest that EVs released by a drug-resistant subpopulation can induce drug resistance in other subpopulations and may sustain intratumoural heterogeneity."

Epub 2018 Nov 4."," Frequency and clinical significance of NF1 mutation in lung adenocarcinomas from  East Asian patients.","NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates Ras signaling. NF1 deficiency plays an important role in carcinogenesis. To investigate the frequency and clinical significance of NF1 mutation, we examined mutation status  of NF1, TP53, LKB1 and RB1 in 704 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas from East Asian patients using semiconductor-based Ion Torrent sequencing platform. Common driver events, including mutations in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, MET, and fusions affecting ALK, RET and ROS1, were also concurrently detected. The correlation between NF1 mutations and clinicomolecular features of patients was further evaluated. Among 704 patients, 42 NF1 mutations were found in 33 patients (33/704, 4.7%), including 14 patients harboring EGFR/NF1 comutations (14/33, 42.4%). Comparing with EGFR-mutant patients, patients harboring NF1 mutations were closely associated with solid component subtype (p = 0.028). Comparing with  KRAS mutations, NF1 mutations were found more common in female and never smokers  (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed  that patients harboring NF1 mutation had similar disease-free survival (DFS) and  overall survival (OS) with patients with KRAS mutation. Although frequently overlapped with EGFR mutation, patients harboring NF1 mutation had significantly  shorter DFS (p = 0.019) and OS (p = 0.004) than patients with EGFR mutation. During follow-up, one female patient with EGFR exon 19 deletion and NF1 Q1815X comutation showed poor response to EGFR TKIs (Gefitinib and Osimertinib) after disease relapse. In conclusion, NF1 mutations define a unique molecular and clinicopathologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma. Examination of NF1 mutation may contribute to molecular subtyping and therapeutic intervention of lung adenocarcinoma."

Recent years have seen advances in mutational analysis and genomics profiling. These advances could improve accuracy of diagnosis of CUPs and might improve the prognosis of patients with CUPs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year old male with an adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin in the lung presented with another tumor of the palate mucosa. The tumor cells in the pleural effusion were all negative for immunohistochemical markers (TTF-1 and Napsin A) and lung-specific oncogenic driver alterations (EGFR mutation and ALK translocation). The tumor of the palate mucosa was likewise identified as an adenocarcinoma, and the cells showed cytological similarities with the tumor cells in the pleural effusion; TTF-1, Napsin A, EGFR mutation and  ALK translocation were all negative. This result suggested that origins of the tumors of the palate mucosa and in the lung were the same, even though the origin had not yet been determined. Next, we addressed whether the tumor of the palate mucosa was a primary tumor or not. Secretory carcinoma (SC), which is a common type of minor salivary gland tumor (MSGT), was suspected; however, mammaglobin was negative and ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion was not observed. Other MSGTs were excluded based on histological and immunohistochemical findings. Furthermore, an  additional examination demonstrated an oncogenic KRAS mutation at codon 12 (p.G12D) in both palate tumor and in pleural effusion. KRAS mutation is known to  exist in one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs), but quite rare in MSGTs. The  possibility of metastasis from other organs was considered unlikely from the results of endoscopic and imaging studies. This result indicated that the primary site of the CUP was indeed the lung, and that the tumor of the palate mucosa was  a metastasis of the LUAD. CONCLUSIONS: A tumor of the palate mucosa that showed diagnostic difficulties was determined to be a metastatic LUAD by genomic alterations and histopathological findings."

We herein evaluated 22C3-PD-L1 expression of NSCLC in a single institution experience and compared it with clinicopathologic features. Materials and methods: We assessed 22C3-PD-L1 expressions of 411 patients with NSCLC from our institution, including in past specimens. Programmed death-ligand  1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing was performed using the PD-L1 clone 22C3 pharmDx kit (Agilent Technologies/Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Patients were separated into 3 groups with <1% (no expression), 1% to 49% (low expression), or  ⩾50% (high expression) positive tumor cells. Results: In all, 137 patients (33%) did not express PD-L1, 155 (38%) showed low expression, and 119 (29%) demonstrated high expression. Archival samples showed lower PD-L1 expression than that of recent samples, and the ratios of no expression case significantly increased by using paraffin blocks embedded particularly in more than 4 years ago. Programmed death-ligand 1 positivity was significantly associated with male sex, smoking, higher tumor grade, squamous cell carcinoma in histologic type, wild-type EGFR, and ALK rearrangement positive. Conclusions: The rate of 22C3-PD-L1 expression of NSCLC detected in this study was similar to the frequencies of the previous reports, although the ratio of expression case decreased when using old paraffin blocks."

They have achieved better results in prolonging the progression free survival and improving quality of life in comparison to chemotherapy. We have assembled the evidence related to the efficacy and safety of these agents in the  treatment of ALK positive NSCLC. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using electronic databases of PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library  to identify the studies involving comparison of ALK inhibitors to chemotherapy and Next generation ALK inhibitors to crizotinib. PFS was the primary outcome while other outcomes like ORR, adverse events, quality of life and OS were also analyzed and compared. Hazard ratios and odds ratios obtained were analyzed using fixed effect or random effects model in Review Manager Software. Results: A total of 12 studies (n = 3,297) met the criteria for inclusion in this review and meta-analysis. ALK inhibitors including crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib revealed significantly better PFS (HR 0.42 [0.35, 0.50; p < 0.00001]), ORR (Overall OR 6.59 [4.86, 8.94; p < 0.00001] as compared to chemotherapy in the first line as well as second line treatment settings. Intracranial response rate  was better with ALK inhibitors (ceritinib and alectinib) as compared to chemotherapy OR 6.51 [2.86, 14.83; p < 0.00001]. No significant increase in grade 3 or 4 adverse events was observed with crizotinib (OR 1.21 [0.82, 1.77; p = 0.34]) or ceritinib (OR 1.49 [0.86, 2.57; p = 0.17]) when compared to chemotherapy individually. Quality of life indicators assessed were significantly improved with ALK inhibitors. Next generation agents (ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib) revealed significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.50 [0.43, 0.57; p < 0.00001]), ORR (OR 1.57 [1.21, 2.04; p = 0.0006]) in comparison to crizotinib. Next generation agents (Alectinib and brigatinib) yielded better response intra-cranially than crizotinib in terms of objective response rate (OR 5.87 [3.49, 9.87; p < 0.00001]) and time to CNS progression (HR 0.25 [0.13, 0.46; p <  0.0001]). Alectinib by far resulted in fewer adverse events than chemotherapy or  crizotinib. Conclusions: Overall ALK inhibitors are safe and effective treatment  option in ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer. Of the ALK inhibitors, Next generation agents in particular alectinib and brigatinib are safer and more effective intra-cranially and can be preferred as first option."

Methods: Twenty-four cases of PMEC and 44 adenosqumous carcinoma diagnosed in the Guangdong General Hospital were tested for MAML2 translocation by fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) using tissue array. An  IHC panel including TTF1, Napsin A, CK5/6, p63, p40 and Ki-67 was performed on the cohort. The clinical data for all cases were collected and all PMEC patients  had follow-up information. Results: The patients' age ranged form 6 to 73 years,  with a median age of 32 years. The male to female ratio was 1.4∶1.0. MAML2 translocation was found in 16/24 (66.7%) cases of PMEC whereas all 44 cases adenosqumous carcinoma were negative for translocation. All the cases of the PMEC were negative for TTF1 and Napsin A but positive for CK5/6, p63 and p40 in the intermediate cells and epidermal-like cells. In most PMEC cases, the Ki-67 expression index was lower than 10%. In contrast, most cases of adenosqumous carcinomas expressed TTF1 and Napsin A in the adenomatous component and CK5/6, p63 and p40 in the squamous component, which expression pattern was different from that of PMEC. Based on IHC staining, 2 cases of highly invasive ALK-positive adenocarcinoma mimicing PMEC were also found in the study. Conclusions: MAML2 gene translocation can be detected in about two-third of PMEC. Translocation of MAML2 gene and lower morphology grading are associated with good prognosis. The combined use of IHC antibodies panel is helpful to distinguish PMEC from the adenosqumous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma mimicing PMEC."

In less than 15 years, multiple molecular targets, led by EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), have been identified, and myriad oral tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now available to target these oncogenic drivers, with the expectation that the majority of patients will respond to treatment and  that progression-free survival (PFS) will exceed 10 to 30 months, far better than we observed historically with chemotherapy alone. As a result, prognosis has improved dramatically in this subset of patients. Osimertinib has largely displaced first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, in the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC. PFS now exceeds 18 months, and central nervous system penetrance is enhanced. Dacomitinib has the distinction of being the first EGFR TKI to demonstrate a survival advantage compared with older TKIs. Recent data suggest therapeutic additivity, if not synergy, for the concurrent use of chemotherapy, as well as monoclonal antibodies targeting angiogenesis, with EGFR TKIs. Alectinib and brigatinib, very specific ALK inhibitors, have proven superior to the erstwhile standard crizotinib in treatment-naive ALK+ NSCLC; PFS now routinely exceeds 2 to 3 years. In addition,  these newer agents have far superior central nervous system penetration. As a result, many patients with ALK+ advanced NSCLC with brain metastases, even some who are symptomatic, can defer or indefinitely avoid brain irradiation. Mechanisms of resistance in ALK are complicated, with multiple new agents being developed in this arena. Although many patients with molecular targets can reasonably expect to live 5 years or more, the emergence of molecular resistance  is virtually inevitable. In this regard, systemic platinum-based chemotherapy is  the final common therapeutic pathway for virtually all patients with oncogenic drivers. Standard regimens include pemetrexed and carboplatin, as well as the E4599 regimen, combination solvent-based paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab. Checkpoint inhibitors, as single agents, have not yielded much benefit, even in those with high levels of PD-L1 expression. However, in a subanalysis of patients with ALK and EGFR mutations enrolled in IMpower150, the addition of atezolizumab to the E4599 regimen led to a major overall survival benefit (hazard ratio < 0.40). In the absence of systemic chemotherapy, combining checkpoint inhibitors with TKIs in this setting remains investigational; several  studies have demonstrated untoward pulmonary and hepatic toxicity."

The clinical and molecular characteristics of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) associated with ALK rearrangement are still unclear. Herein, we assessed the ALK status in a series of patients with LCNEC by testing methods commonly used for adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ALK expression was first examined by immunohistochemistry. For a positively stained tumor, molecular analyses were then conducted. The ALK fusion partner found in a patient with ALK rearrangement was further identified by direct DNA sequencing. Patient clinicopathological features were also analyzed, focusing on the ALK rearrangement-positive case. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry of seven patients identified strong ALK expression  in one case of stage IV LCNEC. Molecular analysis identified a novel rearranged gene resulting from the fusion of kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) exon 17 to ALK exon 20. The patient was treated with ALK-specific inhibitors, crizotinib and later, alectinib, and has remained alive for more than 24 months without disease  progression. Three of the remaining six patients without ALK rearrangement had stage IV cancer and received cytotoxic chemotherapies. Their average overall survival was 5.4 months. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a KIF5B-ALK fusion gene in LCNEC. The patient was successfully treated with ALK inhibitors, suggesting that sensitivity to ALK inhibitor may define a specific LCNEC subtype. We propose that screening for ALK rearrangement in patients with LCNEC may assist in selecting potential candidates for targeted therapy."

This phase II study investigated efficacy and safety of the HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with previously treated advanced HER2-overexpressing NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-overexpressing NSCLC (centrally  tested IHC) and received previous platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy in the case of EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement. Patients were divided into cohorts based on HER2 IHC (2+, 3+). All patients received T-DM1 3.6  mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-determined overall response rate  (ORR) using RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients received T-DM1 (29 IHC 2+, 20 IHC 3+). No treatment  responses were observed in the IHC 2+ cohort. Four partial responses were observed in the IHC 3+ cohort (ORR, 20%; 95% confidence interval, 5.7%-43.7%). Clinical benefit rates were 7% and 30% in the IHC 2+ and 3+ cohorts, respectively. Response duration for the responders was 2.9, 7.3, 8.3, and 10.8 months. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were similar between cohorts. Three of 4 responders had HER2 gene amplification. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: T-DM1 showed a signal of activity in patients with HER2-overexpressing (IHC 3+) advanced NSCLC. Additional investigation into HER2 pathway alterations is needed to refine the target population for T-DM1 in NSCLC; however, HER2 IHC as a single parameter was an insufficient predictive biomarker."

However, METex14 genomic alterations exhibit a highly diverse sequence composition, posing a challenge for clinical diagnostic testing. This study aimed to find a reasonable diagnostic assay for METex14 and identify its clinicopathologic implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of METex14 in 414 EGFR/KRAS/ALK/ROS1-negative (quadruple negative) surgically resected NSCLCs. We used real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing for the first assay, followed by next-generation  sequencing (NGS; hybrid-capture targeted DNA/RNA sequencing). Clinicopathologic implications of the METex14 group were analyzed in a total of 880 NSCLCs. RESULTS: METex14 was confirmed in 13 (3.1%) patients by DNA- and RNA-NGS. After comparison of assay results, qRT-PCR and NGS demonstrated the highest concordance rate. The mean variant allele frequency was 10.5% and 49% in DNA- and RNA-NGS, respectively.

Moreover, METex14 was associated with adenocarcinoma (4.8%; 11/230) or sarcomatoid carcinoma (9.5%; 2/21), old age, never-smokers, and early  stage of disease. CONCLUSIONS: METex14 occurs in about 3% of NSCLCs and has characteristic clinicopathologic features. NGS should be the first assay of choice as a multiplex testing. Sanger sequencing can detect METex14, but sensitivity can be hampered by large deletions or low allele frequency. qRT-PCR, an mRNA-based method, is sensitive and specific and can be appropriate for screening METex14 as a single gene testing."

KRAS mutations did not preclude sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Metastatic EGFR- and ALK-negative lung cancers were screened for FGFR1-MRNA by in-situ hybridization (ISH) and FGFR1-AMP by silver in-situ hybridization (SISH). Patients with positive findings were offered ponatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor of FGFR1-4. Differences in overall survival (OS) between cohorts were assessed by the log-rank test. Association of FGFR1 positivity with clinicopathologic features were assessed by Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. RESULTS: A total of 171 cases were prescreened: 9 (7.3%) of 123 SISH+; 53 (42.1%) of 126 ISH+; and 6 cases concordantly positive for SISH and ISH. SISH+ cases had  fewer coincident KRAS mutations (P = .03) than SISH- cases, and ISH+ cases had worse OS (P = .020) than ISH- cases. Data distributions suggested a distinct higher positivity cut point for FGFR1 ISH (≥ 20%), occurring in 29 (23%) of 126 cases, was associated with small-cell lung cancer histology (P = .022), soft tissue metastases (P = .050) and shorter OS (P = .031). Four patients received ponatinib on study: All ISH+ by the initial cut point, 2 of 4 by higher cut point, 1 of 4 SISH+. Tolerability was poor. The best response for the 2 higher ISH cases was stable disease and progressive disease for the 2 lower ISH cases. CONCLUSION: Elevated FGFR1-MRNA is more common than FGFR1-AMP and associated with worse OS. Higher FGFR1 mRNA expression may be associated with a specific phenotype and is worthy of further exploration. Ponatinib's poor tolerance suggests further fibroblast growth factor receptor exploration in ISH+ cases should utilize more selective FGFR1 inhibitors."

Increased utilization of next-generation sequencing (NGS),  particularly with cell-free circulating tumor DNA, facilitates reevaluation of this premise. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of actionable alterations in 2 distinct LUSC cohorts totaling 492 patients. A total of 410 consecutive patients with stage 3B or 4 LUSC were tested with a targeted cell-free circulating DNA NGS assay, and 82 patients with LUSC of any stage were tested with a tissue NGS cancer panel. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, 467 patients (94.9%) had a diagnosis of LUSC, and 25 patients (5.1%) had mixed histology with a squamous component. A total of 10.5% of the LUSC subgroup had somatic alterations with therapeutic relevance, including in EGFR (2.8%), ALK/ROS1 (1.3%), BRAF (1.5%), and MET amplification or  exon 14 skipping (5.1%). Sixteen percent of patients with mixed histology had an  actionable alteration. In the LUSC subgroup, 3 evaluable patients were treated with targeted therapy for an actionable alteration; all of them experienced partial response. CONCLUSION: In this large, real-world LUSC cohort, we observed a clinically significant prevalence of actionable alterations. Accurate local histopathologic  assessment in advanced-stage LUSC can be challenging. Further evaluation of the genomic landscape in this setting is warranted to potentially identify underappreciated treatment options."

However, small biopsy samples pose a challenge to testing all relevant biomarkers. The present study characterized clinician-ordered single-gene lung cancer testing and evaluated tissue stewardship and the ability to successfully determine mutation status with single-gene testing or investigational use of the Oncomine Dx Target Test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinician-submitted orders for 3659 single-gene tests (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, ERBB2, MET, RET, FGFR1) across 1402 samples at a large US-based commercial reference laboratory and 169 investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were retrospectively evaluated. The testing success rates and tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of single-gene tests per sample. RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations). With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1 biomarker  for 88.4% of the clinical samples. The success rates decreased and tissue consumption increased with testing of additional biomarkers. Investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were permitted 1 tissue slide each and demonstrated success rates similar to single-gene testing for ≥ 5 biomarkers on core needle biopsies, ≥ 4 biomarkers on fine needle aspirations, and ≥ 2 biomarkers on surgical resection specimens. CONCLUSION: Tissue stewardship is important to enable successful completion of genetic testing and informed NSCLC treatment decisions. Preliminary assessment of the investigational Oncomine Dx Target Test suggests it could facilitate access to multiple biomarker testing using small tissue samples to support therapy decisions for patients with advanced NSCLC."

METHODS: We searched electronic databases from inception to Dec. 2016. Clinical trials and retrospective studies regarding crizotinib and crizotinib versus chemotherapy in treatment of NSCLC were eligible. The primary outcomes were the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). RESULTS: Nine studies (five clinical trials and four retrospective studies) including 729 patients met the inclusion criteria. Crizotinib treatment revealed  1-year OS of 77.1% and PFS of 9.17 months. And crizotinib had a better performance than chemotherapy in ORR (OR: 4.97, 95%CI: 3.16 to 7.83, P<0.00001, I2=35%). DCR revealed superiority with crizotinib than chemotherapy (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.33 to 5.01, P<0.00001, I2=0%). PR (partial response) were significant superior to that of chemotherapy through direct systematic review. No statistically significant difference in CR (complete response) was found between  crizotinib-treated group and chemotherapy-treated group. Regarding SD (stable disease), chemotherapy-treated group had a better performance than crizotinib-treated group. Common adverse events associated with crizotinib were visual disorder, gastrointestinal side effects, and elevated liver aminotransferase levels, whereas common adverse events with chemotherapy were fatigue, nausea, and hematologic toxicity. CONCLUSION: This systematic review revealed improved objective response rate and  increased disease control rate in crizotinib group comparing with chemotherapy group. Crizotinib treatment would be a favorable treatment option for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. ALK inhibitors may have future potential applications in other cancers driven by ALK or c-MET gene mutations."

However, the prevalence of these mutations in various populations in India has not been studied. Furthermore, the correlation of histologic pattern with the mutation is  not clear. Materials and Methods: A total of 64 biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinomas were selected. In 51 of these, EGFR mutational analysis was performed using Qiagen EGFR pyrosequencing kit and in 56 cases of these ALK1 immunohistochemistry (IHC)  was done using ALK (D5F3) antibody and the Ventana Benchmark® XT automated IHC slide staining system for the detection of overexpression. The adenocarcinomas were classified into well, moderate, and poorly differentiated, and the histological pattern was recorded according to the WHO 2014 classification. Results: EGFR mutation was positive in 23 cases (45.10%) and positive ALK1 expression by IHC in 12 cases (21.43%). Both mutations were positive in two cases. Both mutations were seen in well-differentiated and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the expression was highest in tumors with a predominant acinar pattern. Conclusions: The incidence of both EGFR and ALK1 mutations is higher in the population studied and seem to correlate with a well differentiated, acinar pattern on morphology."

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of all cases with assessable baseline TP53 status and/or ALK fusion variant treated at our institutions (n = 102). TP53 mutations were present in 17/87 (20%) and the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK variant 3 (V3) in 41/92 (45%) patients. The number of metastatic sites at diagnosis was affected more by the presence of V3 than by TP53 mutations, and highest with both factors  (mean 5.3, p < 0.001). Under treatment with ALK TKI, progression-free survival (PFS) was shorter with either TP53 mutations or V3, while double positive cases appeared to have an even higher risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.9, p = 0.015). The negative effect of V3 on PFS of TKI-treated patients was strong already in the first line (HR = 2.5, p = 0.037) and decreased subsequently, whereas a trend for  PFS impairment under first-line TKI by TP53 mutations became stronger and statistically significant only when considering all treatment lines together. Overall survival was impaired more by TP53 mutations (HR = 4.9, p = 0.003) than by V3 (HR = 2.4, p = 0.018), while patients with TP53 mutated V3-driven tumors carried the highest risk of death (HR = 9.1, p = 0.02). Thus, TP53 mutations and  V3 are independently associated with enhanced metastatic spread, shorter TKI responses and inferior overall survival in ALK+ lung adenocarcinoma. Both markers could assist selection of cases for more aggressive management and guide development of novel therapeutic strategies. In combination, they define a patient subset with very poor outcome."

Increasing understanding of the molecular changes that drive tumor progression has transformed the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless, various countries differ in the degree of implementation of genetic tests and the availability of innovative drugs. The LungCARD consortium created a questionnaire to collect information about the local research and clinical practices related to lung cancer diagnosis and therapy. METHODS: A survey composed of 37 questions related to specific lung cancer pharmacogenomics and therapy, was distributed among 18 countries. RESULTS: All together 36 responses were gathered, answered mainly by clinicians.  The majority attends 50-200 cancer cases per month, 20-50% of all cancer cases are lung cancer patients, and more than 80% are with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapy is applied to 50% on average of all NSCLC patients. Forty five percent of participating medical oncologists are treating their patients with immunotherapy. More than 90% of the respondents are guided by results of genetic tests in introducing targeted treatment. As expected, the majority orders EGFR gene testing (85%), followed by ALK (58%) and KRAS testing (32%). Almost all (96%) agreed that more biomarkers should be included in routine genetic testing (ROS1, anti-PDL1, KRAS, MET, HER2, BRAF...), and that blood test  is useful in pharmacogenomic testing. CONCLUSION: There is a great variation between countries with respect to all discussed topics. However, the majority recognized a necessity of introducing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics and potential of testing from  blood. The biggest problem in the treatment of NSCLC is still an access to innovative drugs."

This study elucidated the prevalence and prognostic significance of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) and rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) in patients with surgically resected primary LAC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 675 consecutive patients who underwent radical resection at a single institution. We concurrently analyzed mutations in EGFR and the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog gene (KRAS)  by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and investigated ALK rearrangements by immunohistochemistry. LAC with or without various oncogenic mutations was studied for clinicopathological features and their association with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULT: ALK rearrangements and EGFR mutations were detected in 75 and 312 patients, respectively, with coexistence in 5 cases. ALK rearrangements and mutations in EGFR and KRAS were mutually exclusive. Compared with patients with EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements were more common in younger patients, and those with advanced tumors, lymph node metastases, and higher rates of postoperative adjuvant therapy. Histologically, EGFR mutations were more common than ALK rearrangements in patients with the acinar predominant subtype and the lepidic predominant subtype of LAC, whereas ALK rearrangements were more frequent in the solid predominant subtype with mucin production and invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas. ALK-positive patients had a significantly worse DFS than those with EGFR mutations and wild-type (WT) patients. The mean OS after surgical procedures was significantly longer in EGFR-mutated versus WT patients. No significant differences were found in patients with ALK-positive tumors compared  with EGFR-mutated and WT patients. CONCLUSION: Clinicopathological features of LAC with ALK rearrangements differ from those of LAC with EGFR mutations. Patients with ALK rearrangements had a significantly worse DFS than those harboring EGFR mutations. Thus, ALK rearrangements are an adverse prognostic factor in surgically-resected LAC patients, while EGFR mutations are associated with a better prognosis."

In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors. Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction  with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib. These ALK mutations have significant influences on the flexibility of P-loop region and DFG sequences, but do not impair the hydrogen bonds between brigatinib and the residue Met1199 of hinge region. And mutations (L1196M, G1269A, F1174L, and R1275Q) induce diverse conformational changes of brigatinib and the obvious energy variation of residues Glu1167, Arg1209, Asp1270, and Asp1203. Together, the detailed explanation of mechanisms of those mutations with brigatinib further provide several guidelines  for the development of more effective ALK inhibitors."

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement are commonly found in patients of adenocarcinoma lung against, which targeted therapy is available. In this era of  personalized medicine, it is a rationale to detect these molecular alterations in cases of lung carcinomas. Aims: The objectives were to compare the diagnostic efficacy of cytological samples for the detection of EGFR and ALK protein expression using immunocytochemistry in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. Materials and Methods: We compared 22 cell blocks and biopsies for the detection  of EGFR and ALK protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). EGFR IHC was performed using EGFR Receptor (E746-A750 del Specific) (6B6) monoclonal antibody  and ALK IHC was done using Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) monoclonal primary antibody. Results: Two cases were found to be positive; 20 cases were negative for EGFR IHC both in biopsies and cell blocks. ALK IHC was positive in one case; negative in 21 cases. The results of IHC were also concordant for biopsies and cell blocks. The sensitivity and specificity were 100% for immunocytochemical detection of ALK and EGFR in cell blocks with respect to biopsies. Conclusion: We conclude that cell blocks can serve as a potential substitute for  biopsies for detection of EGFR and ALK protein by immunocytochemistry, whenever patient presents with effusion and biopsy cannot be done or when tissue is not adequate."

Age, marital status, educational level, annual household income, occupation, histology of lung cancer, tumor stage, smoking status, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) level, drive gene mutations, sleep quality, and patient personality were assessed. Physical nicotine dependence was assessed by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). RESULTS: In total, 202 smokers were included in this study. Univariate analysis showed that marital status and pain were significantly correlated with nicotine dependence. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that age at the initiation of smoking, attempts to quit, NSE level, and sleep quality were significantly correlated with FTND scores. CONCLUSIONS: Pain, more attempts to quit, and poorer sleep quality were significantly associated with nicotine dependence. These risk factors could help  to prevent smoking in Chinese patients with lung cancer."

New promising therapies have emerged based on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunity checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including anti-PD-1, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab. The  prescription of pembrolizumab has been approved by FDA and EMA for advanced stages non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), restricted for first-line setting to patients whose tumor presents ≥50% of PD-L1 positive tumor cells (TC), and ≥1% for second-line and beyond, leading to consider PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic tool for pembrolizumab. Very recently, the EMA has approved durvalumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC not progressing after chemoradiotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 on ≥1% of TC. Four standardized PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays have been used in clinical trials; 22C3 and 28-8 PharmDx assays on Dako/Agilent platforms, and SP142 and SP263 assays on Ventana platforms, each test having been developed initially for a specific ICI. They differ in terms of primary monoclonal antibody, platform, detection system and scoring methods with different thresholds of positivity validated in clinical trials. Several studies have shown a close analytical performance of the 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 assays regarding TC staining in NSCLC, with poor concordance with SP142 assay and for immune cells. However, as dedicated platforms are not available in all pathology laboratories and because of the high cost of these assays, laboratory developed tests are widely used in many countries. Their validation must guarantee the same sensitivities and specificities as compared to standardized assays. Overall, PD-L1 test is of great help to select patients who could benefit for ICI and most pathologists have included this test in their daily practice for advanced stages NSCLC, besides ALK and ROS1 IHC."

The impact of sequential ICI and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy on the risk of hepatotoxicity has not been described. METHODS: Patients with advanced ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)-driven, ROS1-driven, or MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET)-driven NSCLC treated with crizotinib, with or without preceding ICI therapy, were identified.  The cumulative incidences of crizotinib-associated grade 3 or higher increases in transaminase level (per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) were compared. RESULTS: We identified 453 patients who had NSCLC with an oncogenic alteration in ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK), ROS1, or MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase gene (MET) and were treated with crizotinib (11 with and 442 without prior ICI therapy). Among the 11 patients treated with an ICI followed by crizotinib, five (cumulative incidence 45.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 14.9-72.2]) experienced development of a grade 3 or 4 increase in alanine transaminase level and four (cumulative incidence 36.4% [95% CI: 10.0-64.2]) experienced development of a grade 3 or 4 increase in aspartate transaminase level. In comparison, among the 442 patients who received crizotinib only, a grade 3 or 4 increase in alanine transaminase level occurred in 34 patients (cumulative incidence 8.1% [95% CI: 5.7-11.0, p < 0.0001]) and a grade 3 or 4 increase in aspartate transaminase level occurred in 14 (cumulative incidence 3.4% [95% CI: 1.9-5.5, p < 0.0001]). There were no grade 5 transaminitis events.  All cases of hepatotoxicity after sequential ICI and crizotinib use were reversible and nonfatal, and no case met the Hy's law criteria.

RESULTS: As of December 1, 2017, the median follow-up time was 23.9 months. The ORR was 56.7% with pembrolizumab plus PC versus 30.2% with PC alone (estimated difference 26.4% [95% CI: 8.9%‒42.4%, p = 0.0016]). PFS was significantly improved with pembrolizumab plus PC versus PC alone (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33‒0.86, p = 0.0049). A total of 41 patients in the PC-alone group received subsequent anti‒programmed death 1/anti‒programmed death ligand 1 therapy. The HR for OS was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.32‒0.95, p = 0.0151). Forty-one percent of patients in the pembrolizumab plus PC group and 27% in the PC-alone group had grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The significant improvements in PFS and ORR with pembrolizumab plus  PC versus PC alone observed in the primary analysis were maintained, and the HR for OS with a 24-month median follow-up was 0.56, favoring pembrolizumab plus PC."

We sought to extend the use of broad panel sequencing results to survival stratification and clinical outcome prediction. Patients and Methods: Using sequencing results from a cohort of 1,054 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas, we developed OncoCast, a machine learning tool for survival risk stratification and biomarker identification. Results: With OncoCast, we stratified this patient cohort into four risk groups based on tumor genomic profile. Patients whose tumors harbored a high-risk profile had a median survival of 7.3 months (95% CI 5.5-10.9), compared to a low  risk group with a median survival of 32.8 months (95% CI 26.3-38.5), with a hazard ratio of 4.6 (P<2e-16), far superior to any individual gene predictor or standard clinical characteristics. We found that co-mutations of both STK11 and KEAP1 are a strong determinant of unfavorable prognosis with currently available  therapies. In patients with targetable oncogenes including EGFR/ALK/ROS1 and received targeted therapies, the tumor genetic background further differentiated  survival with mutations in TP53 and ARID1A contributing to a higher risk score for shorter survival. Conclusion: Mutational profile derived from broad-panel sequencing presents an effective genomic stratification for patient survival in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. OncoCast is available as a public resource that facilitates the incorporation of mutational data to predict individual patient prognosis and compare risk characteristics of patient populations."

Systemic therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy should be provided to patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Applications of targeted therapy, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase  (ALK) inhibitors, in patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement has enabled dramatic improvements in efficacy and tolerability. Despite advances in research and a better understanding of the molecular pathways of NSCLC, few effective therapeutic options are available for most patients with  NSCLC without druggable targets, especially for patients with squamous cell NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 or anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have demonstrated durable response rates across a broad range of solid tumors, including NSCLC, which has revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors. Here, we review the current status and future approaches of immune checkpoint inhibitors that are being investigated for NSCLC with a focus on pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab."

It has remained unclear, however, whether cytotoxic chemotherapy affects the immune microenvironment in NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated changes in programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density in NSCLC patients who underwent rebiopsy at the site of recurrence after postoperative platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, or in those who underwent rebiopsy after one or more chemotherapeutic regimens at the advanced stage. The PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) and CD8+ TIL density were determined by immunohistochemistry. TMB was estimated by next-generation sequencing with a cancer gene panel (409 genes). RESULTS: Seventeen patients with NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK were enrolled.  Although PD-L1 TPS tended to be increased in rebiopsy samples compared with initial biopsy tissue, this difference was not significant (P =  0.113). Seven patients showed an increase in PD-L1 TPS, with this change being pronounced in four. Two cases in which PD-L1 TPS increased from 0 to 90% or from 0 to 95% after cytotoxic chemotherapy also showed a durable response to subsequent treatment with an ICI. No substantial correlation between PD-L1 TPS and TMB was apparent either before (R = 0.112) or after (R = 0.101) chemotherapy. A moderate correlation was detected between PD-L1 TPS and CD8+ TIL density before chemotherapy (R = 0.517) and a negligible correlation after (R = 0.0219). CONCLUSION: Cytotoxic chemotherapy may change the biological characteristics of tumors including PD-L1 expression level and TMB."

This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus SoC platinum-based chemotherapy from the French healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A three-state partitioned-survival model was adapted to project outcomes and costs of squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients respectively, over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical and utility data were collected from the trial. A  network meta-analysis was performed to consider platinum-based triplets also used for non-squamous NSCLC. Direct medical costs were considered based on ressources  identified from the trial and literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per Life Year (LY) and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: For squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.93 LY (11 months), and 0.74 QALY (9 months) for an incremental cost of €62,032 compared with platinum-based doublets. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based doublets was €66,825/LY and €84,097/QALY. For non-squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.85-1.32 LYs (10.2-15.8 months) and 0.64-1.02 QALYs (7.7-12.2 months) for an incremental cost varying from €-14,947-+47,064 depending on the specific comparator. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was €62,846/LY and €78,729/QALY; regimens including pemetrexed were dominated. Results were most sensitive to extrapolations of survival outcomes and assumptions for continued effectiveness and treatment duration of pembrolizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab appears cost-effective versus SoC chemotherapy for first-line treatment of PD-L1-positive (50%) metastatic NSCLC patients in France, assuming willingness-to-pay under 100,000€/QALY (OECD threshold in the discussion section)."

However, resistance mechanisms following multiple TKI treatments in ALK-positive NSCLC are not fully elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mutation profiles of 422 cancer-relevant genes in 52 patients with post-TKI biopsy samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS), and compared between patients receiving crizotinib alone (n = 35) and multi-TKIs (n = 17). RESULTS: EML4-ALK variant 3 is the most frequent ALK variants in this cohort, followed by EML4-ALK variant 1. Half of the patients harbored ALK activating mutations upon progression on crizotinib treatment. After multi-TKIs treatment, 59% of the cases developed resistant ALK mutations, and concomitant ALK activating mutations were more commonly observed in this cohort (P = 0.031). Specifically, ALK G1269 A, L1196 M, and C1156Y substitutions were more common in  crizotinib-alone samples, while ALK G1202R was significantly more enriched post-multi-TKIs (P = 0.009). Activated bypass signaling tended to be more prevalent in patients post-multi-TKIs. Furthermore, dual activation of ALK and bypass signaling was more frequently found in the multi-TKIs group (5/17, 29%) in contrast to crizotinib-alone (2/35, 6%) (P = 0.031). Additionally, concurrent TP53 mutation demonstrated significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS)  compared with TP53 wildtype in crizotinib-alone group (median PFS: 8 vs 13 months, Hazard Ratio = 1.494, P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Concurrent ALK activating mutations and/or upregulated bypass signaling are more enriched in patients undergoing multiple ALK TKI treatments compared to crizotinib alone. Concomitant TP53 mutation correlated to unfavorable survival when receiving a single TKI crizotinib."

In this era of cancer immunotherapy, humanized mouse models which recapitulate human immune system, are needed for predicting immunotherapy response in patients. We established a Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which can be used as a preclinical testing platform for assessing efficacy of different immunotherapeutic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model was established by engrafting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into NOD/scid/IL-2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice. Cytokine array was performed to assess serological similarity between patient and the Hu-PBL-NSG mouse, and microscopic immune cell infiltration was observed in various organs mouse model. Human anti-PD-1 therapy was treated for assessing drug efficacy in patient-derived tumor. RESULTS: hCD3+hCD45+ T-cells and antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and MDSC) increased in the serum of Hu-PBL-NSG mouse 24 h after the  transfusion of human PBMCs, and CD3 + T cells were observed in lung, liver, kidney, spleen sections. Cytokine arrays of human and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse revealed high similarity of Th1, Th2, Th17-related cytokines. A tumor xenograft was engrafted from an EML4-ALK patient, and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse was sacrificed for histological analyses. hCD3+ T cells were infiltrated within the tumor, and CD11c + cells, which represent antigen-presenting capability, were seen in spleen, lung, liver and kidney. When anti-PD-1 Ab was treated intraperitoneally,  xenograft tumor showed significant reduction in volume after day 6, and increased expression of immune response-related genes on microarray analysis in the tumor.  Mostly IFN-gamma and its related gene sets were significantly changed (FDR < 0.25, GSEA). CONCLUSION: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which highly resembles human immune system was successfully established. This model could be a strong preclinical model for testing efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents, and also for pursuing novel immunotherapy treatment strategies in advanced NSCLC."

EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 are 3 major driver genes that play an important role in lung cancer development and precision management. Additionally, rare genetic alterations continue to be discovered and may become novel targets for therapy. The RET gene is one of such  rare genetic alteration of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this report, we present a RET-positive case that benefited from cabozantinib treatment. PATIENT CONCERN: A 50-year-old male patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma 2 years ago, at that time he received palliative surgery of pulmonary carcinoma and completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Six months later, he was hospitalized in our cancer center due to the  disease recurrence, presenting with pleural metastasis. DIAGNOSIS: Gene alteration was examined using the intraoperative specimen by PCR  method, and KIF5B/RET gene fusion was detected. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with late-stage lung adenocarcinoma with RET gene mutation. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received treatment with cabozantinib from June 2017. OUTCOMES: Cabozantinib was administered (140 mg orally, once daily) for approximate 9 months, and his disease achieved stable disease (SD). During that period, there were no severe adverse events (AE), except for a grade II rash (CTCAE 4.0). LESSONS: We found that the RET fusion gene is a novel driver molecular of lung adenocarcinoma in patients without common mutations in such genes as EGFR, ALK, and ROS1. This case report supports a rationale for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients with a RET fusion and provides alternative treatment options for these types of NSCLC patients."

AIM: Activation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene has been found in several human cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, novel drugs targeting ALK gene have been extensively investigated in NSCLC. However, concerns about ALK inhibitors-induced liver toxicities have been increasing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible prospective clinical studies have been searched in several databases. Primary outcomes of interest were incidence rates of liver  toxicities, relative risks (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Data from 2418 patients (1873 in the experimental arm; 545 in the control arm) were included. The incidences of all-grade alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation were 26.0% (95% CI: 17.4%-37%), and 23.2% (95% CI, 16.7%-31.4%), respectively. The incidences of high-grade ALT and AST elevation were 8.4% (95% CI, 5.1%-13.4% and 7.0% (95% CI:  5.4%-9.0%), respectively. Sub-group analysis according to the ALK inhibitors found that pooled incidence of liver toxicities associated with ceritinib was higher than that of crizotinib and alectinib. In comparison with chemotherapy, ALK inhibitors significantly increased the all-grade and high-grade ALT elevation (RR 2.37, 95% CI, 1.97-2.86; P < .001; RR 7.34, 95% CI, 3.95-13.63; P < .001) and AST elevation (RR 3.27, 95% CI, 2.47-4.34; P < .001; RR 11.54, 95% CI, 4.33-30.7; P < .001), respectively. No publication bias was detected for RR of ALT and AST. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study offer substantial evidence that ALK inhibitors treatment in advanced NSCLC significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade and high-grade liver toxicities in comparison with controls. Clinicians should recognize liver toxicities promptly as early interventions may  alleviate future complications."

To identify the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to alectinib, two patient-derived cell lines were established from an alectinib-naïve ALK-rearranged lung cancer and then after development of alectinib resistance. The properties acquired during treatments were detected by comparisons of the two cell lines, and then functional analyses were performed. Coactivation of c-Src and MET was identified after the development of alectinib resistance. Combinatorial therapy against Src and MET significantly restored alectinib sensitivity in vitro (17.2-fold). Increased apoptosis, reduction of tumor volume, and inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling molecules for proliferation and survival were observed when the three kinases (Src, MET, and ALK) were inhibited. A patient-derived xenograft from the alectinib-resistant cells indicated that combination therapy with a saracatinib and crizotinib significantly decreased tumor size in vivo. To confirm the generality, a conventional alectinib-resistant cell line model (H2228-AR1S) was established from NCI-H2228 cells (EML4-ALK variant 3a/b). In H2228-AR1S, combination inhibition of Src and MET also restored alectinib sensitivity. These data reveal that dual salvage signaling from MET and Src is a potential therapeutic target in alectinib-resistant patients. IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility to elucidate personalized drug-resistance mechanisms from individual patient samples."

Four patients operated for primary lung carcinoma and unisite N2 mediastinal involvement were consecutively  selected. Samples (tumour and paired LN) were analysed for PD1, PD-L1 and CD8 immunostaining.

A total of 9 primary lung cancer samples and 10 LN stations were analysed. For each cancer, we found 2 mutations, with allelic ratios from 3% to 72%. Mutational patterns were heterogeneous for 2 primary tumours. In 3 cases, mutations observed in the primary tumour were not found in LN metastases (ALK, FGFR3, MET). Inversely, in 1 case, a KRAS mutation was found in LN but not in the primary tumour. All primary tumours were found PD-L1 positive while CD8+ T cells  infiltrate varied. In the different examined LN samples, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ and PD1+ T cells infiltrate were not similar to the primary tumour. This preliminary prospective study shows the diversity of intra-tumour and LN mutations using routinely-used targeted NGS, concerning both mutated gene and allelic ratio. Further studies are needed to evaluate its prognostic impact."

Alectinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor and was shown to be effective for a broad spectrum of ALK rearrangements and ALK mutations. It was also shown to have high intracranial efficacy. In this article, we review clinical trial evidence of alectinib efficacy as well as publications reporting the experience of alectinib in daily practice, with a focus on brain metastases."

METHODS: Reflex simultaneous genotypic screening for EGFR by peptide nucleic acid clamping, and ALK and ROS1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on consecutive NSCLC cases at the time of initial pathologic diagnosis. We evaluated genetic aberrations, clinicopathologic characteristics, and PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) using a PD-L1 22C3 assay kit. RESULTS: In 407 consecutive NSCLC patients, simultaneous genotyping identified 14 (3.4%) ROS1 and 19 (4.7%) ALK rearrangements, as well as 106 (26%) EGFR mutations. These mutations were mutually exclusive and were found in patients with similar clinical features, including younger age, a prevalence in women, adenocarcinoma, and advanced stage. The PD-L1 assay was performed on 130 consecutive NSCLC samples. High PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50%) was observed in 29 (22.3%) tumors. PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 1%) was significantly associated with wild type EGFR, while ROS1 rearrangement was associated with high PD-L1 expression. Of the 14 cases with ROS1 rearrangement, 12 (85.7%) showed PD-L1 expression and 5 (35.7%) showed high PD-L1 expression. CONCLUSION: In the largest consecutive routine Asian NSCLC cohort analyzed to date, we found that high PD-L1 expression frequently overlapped with ROS1 rearrangement, while it negatively correlated with EGFR mutations."

However, the development of acquired resistance often limits the duration of these therapies. While several mechanisms of secondary resistance have been already identified, little is known about molecular determinants of primary resistance. In our brief report we investigated the tumor molecular profile of a patient who failed to respond to Crizotinib. METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were run on tumor specimen as well as search and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood. Confirmation of clinical findings was achieved using a translational cell-line in vitro model. RESULTS: We identified the amplification of MYC as a potential new mechanism of primary resistance to ALK inhibition. Human EML4-ALK rearranged cells infected with a lentiviral vector carrying full-length human MYC cDNA were treated in vitro with crizotinib and alectinib. Overexpression of MYC overexpression was associated with a reduced sensitivity to both ALK-inhibitors. MYC-overexpressing  clones displayed also increased levels of both cyclin D and E and their growth was reduced by using Cdk4/6 inhibitors such as Palbociclib. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that the MYC gene may be implicated in the mechanism of primary resistance to ALK inhibitors. We also suggest potential MYC-directed inhibition strategies to overcome primary resistance in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC."

A 54-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma harboring ALK rearrangement previously treated with first-line alectinib and second-line cisplatin/pemetrexed showed poor performance status (PS) with rapid progression.  She was treated with ceritinib as salvage treatment, upon which tumor shrinkage was demonstrated on CT and her PS gradually improved. The best supportive care is recommended for patients with advanced NSCLC with poor PS due to lower treatment  efficacy and more toxicities than those with good PS. In this case, rapid progression led to a poor PS; however, ceritinib achieved a breakthrough in this  case. The optimal treatment sequence and key drugs in ALK-positive NSCLC remain controversial."
