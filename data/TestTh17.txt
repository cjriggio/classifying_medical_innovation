Innate immunity activates the adaptive immunity, and both act highly regulated together  to establish and maintain tissue homeostasis. Any dysregulation of this interaction can result in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity and is thought to be a major underlying cause in the initiation and progression of highly prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases among others, and periodontitis. Th1 and Th2 cells of the adaptive immune system are the major players in the pathogenesis of IMIDs. In addition, Th17 cells, their key cytokine IL-17, and IL-23 seem to play pivotal roles. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge about the differentiation of Th17 cells and the role of the IL-17/IL-23 axis in the pathogenesis of IMIDs. Moreover, it aims to review the association of these IMIDs with periodontitis and briefly discusses the therapeutic potential of agents that modulate the IL-17/IL-23 axis."

Recently, a new CARD14 -associated phenotype defined as CAPE (CARD14-associated papulosquamous eruption) with clinical features of both psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris was reported. We describe a family carrying a novel heterozygous mutation in CARD14 gene, with childhood-onset erythrodermic psoriasis requiring an unusual extremely high dose (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab to achieve disease remission. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a large family with three pairs of twins presenting a clinical phenotype characterized by childhood-onset erythrodermic psoriasis; in some family members is also reported psoriatic arthritis. The two probands presented poor clinical response to topic and systemic therapy with antihistamine, steroid, retinoids, cyclosporine and etanercept. After exclusion of the most common genes associated to autoinflammatory diseases (IL36RN, IL1RN,  MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NLRP12, MEFV, NOD2, PSMB8, PSTPIP1, LPIN2) we approached a  new gene search by subjecting to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis five members of the family. A novel heterozygous mutation (c.446 T > G, leading to the missense amino acid substitution p.L149R) in the exon 4 of the CARD14 gene was identified in all affected members. Increasing dosages (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), allowed the complete control of the clinical  manifestations, with an evident reduction of circulating Th17 and Th22 CD4+ T cell subsets. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the association of mutations of the CARD14 gene with an  erythrodermic psoriasis pedigree, underlying the necessity to investigate CARD14  mutations in childhood-onset psoriasis cases and confirming the presence of CARD14 causative mutations also in erythrodermic psoriasis form, as recently reported. Also in pediatric age, ustekinumab represents a powerful therapeutic option for this rare condition, that is usually refractory to other treatments. In young children, high and frequent dosages allowed a complete control of the clinical manifestations without any severe side effects, with a long-term follow-up."

These fuel a self-amplifying loop where these products  act on T cells to perpetuate cutaneous inflammatory processes. Among the various  inflammatory mediators involved, interleukin (IL)-36 cytokines are important for  the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and Th17 cells in psoriatic skin. In particular, IL-36s induce chemokines and cytokines interfere with differentiation/cornification programs in the epidermis, as well as promote pathological angiogenesis and endothelial cell activation. IL-36 cytokines belong to the IL-1 family, and comprise IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ agonists as well as IL-36 receptor antagonist and IL-38 antagonists. IL-36 cytokines are up-regulated in psoriatic epidermis, and their expression is strongly induced by TNF-α and IL-17. Contrarily, IL-38 antagonist is downregulated, and its impaired expression may be relevant to the dysregulated inflammatory processes induced by IL-36. Here, we discuss on the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the altered balance of IL-36 agonists/antagonists and the significance of this dysregulation in psoriasis. Collection of the information will provide a theoretical basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on IL-36 agonist/antagonist manipulation in psoriasis."

[Epub ahead of print]","Physiological and pathological roles of kallikrein-related peptidases in the epidermis.","Identifying the function of kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) in the epidermis has elicited great interest over recent decades. KLKs comprise 15 serine proteases, and their activities are regulated by complex and fine-tuned mechanisms involving the proteolytic activation cascade, endogenous inhibitors, and environmental factors. When the balance is disrupted, excessive or insufficient protease activity can impair epidermal barrier homeostasis. KLKs are involved in various events, such as skin inflammation, wound healing, pruritus, anti-bacterial activity, and viral susceptibility. One of the primary roles of KLKs, mainly KLK5 and KLK7, is physiological desquamation. Both proteases are also involved in the development of inflammatory skin diseases with barrier abnormalities, e.g., Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis (AD). In Netherton  syndrome, unrestricted activity of KLK5 due to loss of the major endogenous inhibitor, lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI), destroys the component molecules of corneodesmosome, leading to Th2 and Th17 inflammation. Meanwhile, the increased activity of KLK7 in the hyperkeratotic lesions of chronic AD is suppressed by upregulated LEKTI. The functions and implications of  other KLKs including KLK6 and KLK8 in healthy and diseased skin such as psoriasis represent an exciting but relatively unexplored area. Clarifying the function of  epidermal KLKs will enable development of disease-specific biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies."

It is associated with a number of comorbidities, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and myocardial infarction. In addition, the severity of psoriasis seems to be related to the severity of obesity. Patients with higher levels of obesity show poorer response to systemic treatments of psoriasis. Several studies have demonstrated that white adipose tissue is a crucial site of  the formation of proinflammatory adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin and classical cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-) 6 and tumour necrosis factor-α. In psoriasis, due to the proliferation of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells, IL-22, among others, is produced in addition to the abovementioned cytokines. With respect to leptin and resistin, both of these adipokines are present in high levels in obese persons with psoriasis. Further, the plasma levels of leptin and  resistin are related to the severity of psoriasis. These results strongly suggest that obesity, through proinflammatory pathways, is a predisposing factor to the development of psoriasis and that obesity aggravates existing psoriasis. Different inflammatory biomarkers link psoriasis and obesity. In this paper, the  most important ones are described."

In spite of the importance of TSP-1 not only as anti-angiogenic factor but also as an immunomodulatory molecule, studies on the role of TSP-1 in psoriasis have been neglected. TSP-1 and CD47 expression were analyzed in skin samples from psoriasis patients and control subjects using RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Expression of these molecules was also evaluated in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells, moDCs, and circulating primary DCs. The functional role of TSP-1/CD47 signaling axis in psoriasis was assessed in Th17 and Treg differentiation assays. Additionally, small interfering RNA assays specific to TSP-1 were performed in CD4+ T cells and monocyte derived DC to specifically evaluate the function of this protein. Lesional skin of psoriasis patients expressed lower TSP-1 and CD47 mRNA levels compared to non-lesional skin or skin from controls. Immunofluorescence staining revealed decreased expression  of CD47 in CD45+ dermal cells from psoriasis samples compared to control subjects. Peripheral CD4+ T cells and circulating primary DCs from psoriasis also expressed lower levels of CD47 compared to controls. Although no significant differences were detected in TSP-1 expression in CD4+ T cells and moDCs between patients and controls, TSP-1 expression in psoriasis patients inversely correlated with disease activity evaluated by the Psoriasis Area and Index Activity. Furthermore, exogenous TSP-1 inhibited Th17 differentiation and stimulated the differentiation of CD4+ T cells toward Treg cells. Furthermore, RNA interference specific for TSP-1 confirmed the role of this molecule as a negative regulator of T cell activation. Because of the impact of TSP-1/CD47 signaling axis in Th17 and Treg differentiation, a dysregulated expression of these molecules in the immune cells from psoriasis patients may favor the exacerbated inflammatory response in this disease."

[Epub ahead of print]","Long-term Western diet intake leads to dysregulated bile acid signaling and dermatitis with Th2 and Th17 pathway features in mice.","BACKGROUND: Dietary interventions are implicated in the development of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and acne. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of diet and the bile acid (BA) receptors, such as TGR5 (Takeda G protein receptor 5) and S1PR2 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2) in the development of dermatitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (CD) or Western diet (WD) since weaning until they were 10 months old followed by analyzing histology, gene expression, and BA profiling. RESULTS: Mice developed dermatitis as they aged and the incidence was higher in females than males. Additionally, WD intake substantially increased the incidence of dermatitis. Cutaneous antimicrobial peptide genesS100A8, S100A9, and Defb4 were reduced in WD-fed mice, but increased when mice developed skin lesions. In addition, Tgr5 and TGR5-regulated Dio2 and Nos3 were reduced in WD intake but induced in dermatitic lesions. Trpa1 and Trpv1, which mediate itch, were also increased in dermatitic lesions. The expression of S1pr2 and genes encoding sphingosine kinases, S1P phosphatases, binding protein, and transporter were all  reduced by WD intake but elevated in dermatitic lesions. Furthermore, dermatitis  development increased total cutaneous BA with an altered profile, which may change TGR5 and S1PR2 activity. Moreover, supplementation with BA sequestrant cholestyramine reduced epidermal thickening as well as cutaneous inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: In summary, activation of TGR5 and S1PR2, which regulate itch, keratinocyte proliferation, metabolism, and inflammation, may contribute to WD-exacerbated dermatitis with Th2 and Th17 features. In addition, elevated total BA play a significant role in inducing dermatitis and cutaneous inflammation."

[Epub ahead of print]","Apremilast increases IL-10-producing regulatory B cells and decreases proinflammatory T cells and innate cells in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.","OBJECTIVES: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis are immune-mediated inflammatory diseases sharing common immunological mechanisms. Regulatory B cells (Breg cells) producing IL-10 (B10 cells), a critical anti-inflammatory B-cell subset, were found to be decreased in both PsA and psoriasis. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4(PDE4) inhibitor, increases IL-10 and therefore, we examined the effect of apremilast on Breg cells. METHODS: Fifty patients, including 20 with PsA and 30 with psoriasis, were included in the study. The effect of apremilast on Breg cells at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment, was examined by flow cytometry in ODN2006 (TLR9)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and magnetically-isolated cells. Th1 cells, Th17 cells and NKT were also measured. RESULTS: Ex vivo stimulated cell analysis identified that post-apremilast (IL-10+CD19+) B10 cells were increased in all PsA and psoriasis patients and correlated with psoriatic skin and joint clinical improvement. Apremilast decreased IFNγ(+) T and NKT cells and IL-17(+)NKT cells. B10 cells also inversely correlated with Th1 cells, and IFNγ(+)NKT cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Breg cells are a major target of apremilast in PsA and psoriasis and that apremilast-induced increase of Breg cells is associated with a decrease of Th1 cells, IFNγ-producing NKT cells and IL-17-producing NKT cells."

The relationships between IL-23 blockade,  serum markers downstream of IL-23 signaling, and withdrawal were explored with guselkumab in VOYAGE 2. METHODS: At week 28, patients with ≥90% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index improvement from baseline (PASI 90) were re-randomized to withdrawal and received placebo (n=182), or maintenance therapy (n=193). The guselkumab withdrawal group  reinitiated guselkumab upon loss of ≥50% of week 28 PASI improvement or by week 72. Cytokines changes associated with psoriasis recurrence (serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-23) following withdrawal were evaluated. RESULTS: Efficacy in the guselkumab maintenance group was sustained through week  72, while efficacy diminished in the guselkumab withdrawal group (PASI 90: 86.0%  vs. 11.5%). After 20 weeks of retreatment, 80.4% of guselkumab withdrawal patients achieved PASI 90 responses versus baseline. Maintenance of response following withdrawal was associated with suppression of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22. Increases in cytokine levels had poor predictive power for psoriasis reoccurrence as these increases lagged behind increases in PASI scores CONCLUSION: Upon guselkumab withdrawal, most patients lost clinical response and regained responses with retreatment. Correlation of IL-23 signaling serum cytokines increased with disease recurrence, supporting the role of IL-23 in expansion and  maintenance of CD4+ Th17, Th22, and related CD8+ Tc cell subsets producing IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22."

IL-17A has been shown to signal through IL-17 receptor A/IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RA/IL-17RC) complex to  drive inflammatory responses. However, in a psoriasis model, we found that Il17rc deficiency did not completely ameliorate the disease, suggesting another receptor. In search for another IL-17A-interacting receptor, we found that IL-17RD directly bound IL-17A but not IL-17F or IL-17A/F heterodimer and formed a heterodimer with IL-17RA. IL-17A-, but not IL-17F- or IL-17A/F-, mediated gene expression was defective in Il17rd-deficient keratinocytes. Il17rd deficiency in  nonhemopoietic cells attenuated imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Although IL-17RC and IL-17RD differentially activated IL-17A-dependent signaling and gene expression, their compound mutation led to complete deficits in keratinocytes. IL-23 was found induced by IL-17A in keratinocytes, dependent on both IL-17RC and IL-17RD, suggesting feed-forward regulation of IL-23/IL-17 axis in psoriasis. Together, IL-17RD constitutes a second functional receptor for IL-17A and, together with IL-17RC, mediates the proinflammatory gene expression downstream of IL-17A."

Epidemiologic studies suggest a substantial genetic contribution to PsA. There is a strong need for genome-wide association studies on patients with PsA, including PsA-weighted or specific variants, and a  need for a better understanding of the relevance of HLA alleles in disease expression. Interferon signaling and the nuclear factor-κB cascade are involved in PsA, and there are genetic differences between purely cutaneous psoriasis (PsC) and PsA. Psoriasis susceptibility genes for which putative functional coding variants in TYK2 and TRAF3IP2 are strongly associated with PsC and PsA, and neutrophil extracellular traps promote Th17 induction in an Act1 D10N-dependent fashion. Genomics and serological factors may also predict treatment response in tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in PsA, and genetics may play a role in treatment response to TNFi. Collaborations through the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) are essential to increase study population size, which will enhance the  ability to detect the genetic variants that create a predisposition to psoriatic  disease and to predict response to biological therapy."

They are typically composed of various long-chain fatty acids which include saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). UFAs are further classified into several groups, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and omega-6 PUFAs, depending on their chemical structure. Epidemiological studies have suggested the involvement of dietary lipids in the progression or regulation of psoriasis, a common chronic inflammatory skin disease induced via the IL-23/IL-17 axis. Although the underlying mechanisms by which dietary lipids regulate psoriasis have remained unclear, with the advancement of experimental techniques  and the development of psoriasis mouse models, various possible mechanisms have been proposed. For example, SFAs may facilitate psoriatic dermatitis by causing activation of the inflammasome in keratinocytes and macrophages or by inducing IL-17-producing cells, such as Th17 and IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the skin, while omega-3 PUFAs may play inhibitory roles by suppressing Th17 differentiation. In this review, we summarize current data on the roles of dietary lipids in the development of psoriasis as revealed by mouse studies, and  we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for psoriasis from the perspective of dietary lipids."

Current treatment for psoriasis  relies on conventional immunosuppressive agents. However, long-term treatment with global immunosuppression may cause various side effects. Thus, it is compelling to seek alternative drugs for treating psoriasis with potentially less side effects. Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene, an ingredient that originally exists in natural plants and lacks systemic toxicity. BA can regulate immunity with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it's unknown whether BA has a therapeutic effect on psoriasis. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether BA  attenuates psoriatic skin inflammation and to identify its mechanisms of action.  A murine model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis was utilized to evaluate skin lesion while flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed for immunoassays. We found that BA treatment alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammatory skin lesion. BA lowered  the PASI scores, decreased epidermal thickness and reduced T cell infiltration in the skin lesion. Moreover, BA reduced the frequency of IL-17A-expressing CD4+ and γδ T cells in psoriatic mice, but did not alter CD4+FoxP3+ Treg frequency. BA also reduced IL-17A production but increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in serum of the psoriatic mice. Furthermore, BA inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in skin lesions, including RORγt, IL-17A, IL-6 and  TNFα. Importantly, it suppressed NFκB signaling in the skin lesion. Finally, BA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-17A production by CD4+ T-Cells in vitro. Thus, BA attenuates psoriasis and inhibits Th17 development."

The function of TRPA1, however, in psoriasiform dermatitis (PsD) is uncertain. Herein, we found that expression of TRPA1 is highly up-regulated in human psoriatic lesional skin. To study the role  of TRPA1 in PsD, we assessed Psoriasis Severity Index (PSI) scores, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin thickness and pathology, and examined dermal inflammatory infiltrates, Th17-related genes and itch-related genes in c57BL/6 as wild-type (WT) and TRPA1 gene knockout (KO) mice following daily application of topical IMQ cream for 5 days. Compared with WT mice, clinical scores, skin thickness change and TEWL scores were similar on day 3, but were significantly decreased on day 5 in IMQ-treated TRPA1 KO mice (vs WT mice), suggesting reduced inflammation and skin barrier defects. Additionally, the relative area of epidermal Munro's microabscesses and mRNA levels of neutrophil inducible chemokines (S100A8, S100A9 and CXCL1) were decreased in the treated skin of TRPA1 KO mice, suggesting that neutrophil recruitment was impaired in the KO mice. Furthermore, mast cells, CD31+ blood vascular cells, CD45+ leukocytes and CD3+ T cells were all reduced in the treated skin of TRPA1 KO mice. Lastly, mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were decreased in TRPA1 KO mice. In summary, these results suggest a key role for TRPA1 in psoriasiform inflammation and raising its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention."

The role of the adaptive immune system, particularly of Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes, has been regarded as prominent in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis, as well as decreased Tregs function. Immunobiological drugs were administered in therapeutic pulses and a few studies  evaluate their effects on the immune repertoire. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adaptive immune profile of patients with severe psoriasis under immunobiological treatment in two time points. Thirty-two psoriasis patients and  10 control patients were evaluated. In the group of psoriasis patients, 10 patients were on anti-TNF and 14 patients on methotrexate treatment, while 8 individuals were not treated. IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-2, and IL-10 were analyzed. CD4 T cell intracellular cytokines were analyzed. It was observed that  stimulation could significantly increase the production of IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 only before anti-TNF pulse therapy. The activation of Th1 and Treg cells after stimulation was significantly higher before anti-TNF pulse. Patients  on methotrexate or anti-TNF therapy produced significantly lower levels of TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-6. Furthermore, these patients showed a significant decrease in the activated CD4+ T cells. The treatment with immunomodulator or methotrexate modulates the activation of CD4+ T cells, and anti-TNF treatment appears to have  a modulating effect on the activation and production of Th1, Th17, and Treg cells."

Alopecia is also an IL-17-mediated autoimmune  disease, and IL-17 inhibitors have been expected to be the gold standard for the  treatment of alopecia; therefore, the complication of alopecia while using IL-17  may be regarded as an unexpected paradoxical reaction. T helper (Th)17 cells are not cytotoxic enough by themselves to undermine the hair follicle under normal circumstances, they need the coexistence of CD8+ cytotoxic Th1 cells. Th17 cells may be the initiator of the damage of the hair follicle, but CD8 T cells or more powerful Th1 cells are required as followers. The Th17/Th1 axis might convert into a Th1-dominant immune status using IL-17 inhibitors, and the destruction of the hair follicle might result in alopecia. An accumulation of cases is to be expected."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study recruited 70 patients with psoriasis and 76 healthy controls. Cytokine profiles were evaluated, including pro-inflammatory M1 (IL-1 + IL-6 + TNF-α), Th1 (IL-2 + IL-12 + IFN-γ), Th17 (IL-6 + IL-17), and immune-inflammatory response system (IRS = M1 + Th1 + Th17) profiles. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory potential included Th2 (IL-4), Th2 + T regulatory (Th2 + Treg, namely IL-4 + IL-10 + TGF-β), anti-inflammatory (Th2 + Treg + adiponectin), and the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory index. RESULTS: There was a highly significant association between psoriasis and cytokine levels with an effect size of 0.829 and a particularly strong impact on  IL-2 (0.463), IL-12 (0.451), IL-10 (0.532) and adiponectin (0.401). TGF-β and adiponectin were significantly lower while all other cytokines (except IFN-γ) were significantly higher in psoriasis than in controls. In addition, M1, Th1, Th17, Th2 + Treg, and IRS/Anti-inflammatory index were significantly higher in psoriasis patients than in controls. The IRS index, Th2 + Treg, and adiponectin predicted psoriasis with 97.1% sensitivity and 94% specificity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, psoriasis is characterized by increased M1, Th1, Th2 and Th17 profiles together with lowered TGF-β and adiponectin. In addition, we propose a model based on a higher IRS and Th2 + Treg index coupled with lower adiponectin values, which may be used to externally validate the diagnosis of psoriasis. The most important single biomarker of psoriasis is adiponectin. Because the latter may play a role in the modulation of the chronic inflammatory  response in psoriasis, adiponectin could be a new drug target to treat psoriasis."

Dual-secreting Th17 T cells presumably are the predominant sources of the psoriasis phenotype-driving cytokines, IL-17A and IL-22. We thus conducted a meta-analysis of independently acquired RNA-seq psoriasis datasets to explore the relationship between the expression of IL17A and IL22. This analysis failed to support the existence of dual secreting IL-17A/IL-22 Th17 cells as a major source of these cytokines. However, variable relationships amongst the expression of psoriasis susceptibility genes and of IL17A, IL22, and IL23A were identified. Additionally, to shed light on gene expression relationships in psoriasis, we applied a machine learning nonlinear dimensionality reduction strategy (t-SNE) to display the entire psoriasis transcriptome as a 2-dimensonal image. This analysis revealed a variety of gene clusters, relevant to psoriasis pathophysiology but failed to support a relationship between IL17A and IL22. These results support existing theories on alternative sources of IL-17A and IL-22 in psoriasis such as a Th22 cells and non-T cell populations."

Helper T cells (TH), plasmoid, and dermal dendritic cells play a prominent role in the development of  classical psoriatic lesions. Interleukin stimulation is another important process in the pathogenesis of the disease that directly influences keratinocytes and leading to the formation of psoriatic pattern in the skin. Tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) α which releases from keratinocytes activates dendritic cells in the early  stages of complex pathogenesis of psoriasis. Activated keratinocytes also produce other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b and IL-6), antimicrobial peptides, and various chemokines. TNF activates dendritic cells that produce IL-23, leading to  TH17 differentiation. TH17 cells secrete IL-17A, which has been shown to promote  psoriatic skin changes. Consequently, after clarification of these main pathological mechanisms, anti-IL therapies have been accepted as a major treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Here, actual information will be presented about biological agents currently in clinical use or being tested for clinical application for treatment of patients with psoriasis."

Dysregulated Th17 immune responses have been associated with the pathogenesis of  several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. In this article, we describe the in vitro  pharmacology of a potent and selective low molecular weight RORγt inhibitor identified after a structure-based hit-to-lead optimization effort. The compound  interfered with co-activator binding to the RORγt ligand binding domain and impaired the transcriptional activity of RORγt as evidenced by blocked IL-17A secretion and RORE-mediated transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene. The inhibitor effectively reduced IL-17A production by human naive and memory T-cells and attenuated transcription of pro-inflammatory Th17 signature genes, such as IL17F, IL22, IL26, IL23R, and CCR6. The compound selectively suppressed the Th17/IL-17 pathway and did not interfere with polarization of other T helper cell lineages. Furthermore, the inhibitor was selective for RORγt and did not modify the transcriptional activity of the closely related family members RORα and RORβ. Using human keratinocytes cultured with supernatants from compound treated Th17 cells we showed that pharmacological inhibition of RORγt translated to suppressed IL-17-regulated gene expression in keratinocyte cell cultures. Furthermore, in ex vivo immersion skin cultures our RORγt inhibitor suppressed IL-17A production by  Th17-skewed skin resident cells which correlated with reduced human β defensin 2  expression in the skin. Our data suggests that inhibiting RORγt transcriptional activity by a low molecular weight inhibitor may hold utility for the treatment of Th17/IL-17-mediated skin pathologies."

Moreover, several genome wide association studies (GWAS) pinpointing a key genetic association between the HLA-DR locus and RA have led to the generally agreed hypothesis that CD4+ T cells are directly implicated in the disease. Still, RA is a heterogeneous disease and  much effort has been made to understand its different facets. T cell differentiation is driven by mechanisms including antigen stimulation, co-stimulatory signals and cytokine milieu, all of which are abundant in the rheumatic joint, implying that any T cells migrating into the joint may be further affected locally. In parallel to the characterization and classification  of T-cell subsets, the contribution of different effector T cells to RA has been  investigated in numerous studies though sometimes with contradictory results. In  particular, the frequency of Th1 and Th17 cells has been assessed in the synovial joints with various results that could, at least partly, be explained by the stage of the disease. For regulatory T cells, it is largely accepted that they accumulate in RA synovial fluid and that the equilibrium between regulatory T cells and effector cells is a key factor in controlling inflammation processes involved in RA. Recent phenotypic studies describe the possible implication of a  novel subset of peripheral T helper cells (Tph) important for T-B cell cross talk and plasma cell differentiation in the RA joint of ACPA+ (autoantibodies against  citrullinated proteins) RA patients. Finally, cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, historically described as increased in the peripheral blood of RA patients have attracted new attention in the last years.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether topical administration of our novel RORγt inhibitor, S18-000003 has therapeutic potential for psoriasis with low risk of thymic aberrations. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of topical S18-000003 on psoriasis-like skin inflammation and influence on the thymus in a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced K14.Stat3C mouse psoriasis model. RESULTS: S18-000003 markedly inhibited the development of psoriatic skin inflammation via suppression of the IL-17 pathway.

Notably, neither reduction of CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes nor dysregulation of cell cycling was observed in S18-000003-treated mice, even at a  high dose.

Aggravating factors have been identified that initiate and maintain inflammation, including expression of Th1-, Th17-, and Th22-cell derived cytokines. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved damage-associated molecular  pattern molecule high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is significantly increased in the serum of PV patients with disease progression and is decreased under standard therapies. Materials and methods: To better understand the role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of PV, we recruited 22 untreated psoriatic patients with either mild or severe disease, defined by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index. We assessed HMGB1 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression in the skin by immunohistochemistry and analyzed the immune-phenotype of Treg and Th17 cells by  flow cytometry. Results: We found increased staining for HMGB1 in the dermis of psoriatic plaques in comparison to uninvolved skin of patients with PV. In addition, the major histocompatibility complex class III-encoded DNA and HMGB1 RAGE, induced by HMGB1, were highly expressed on psoriatic CD8+ T cells and CD4+ Treg. High expression of HMGB1 in the lesional skin was associated with even higher expression of its receptor, RAGE, on the cell surface of keratino-cytes in patients with severe PV. Conclusion: The presence of HMGB1 and RAGE signaling may impact orchestration of  chronic inflammation in PV which might have implications for Treg and Th17 cells."

Accordingly, the migration of DCs to CCR7 ligands was increased, while migration to pro-inflammatory chemokines was decreased. Of note, the action of CHF6001 was apparently mediated by a promoter-specific decrease in NF-κB p65 recruitment, independent of perturbation of LPS signalling or NF-κB nuclear translocation. Our results indicate that CHF6001 can modulate DC pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 polarizing potential by fine tuning the transcriptional activity of the  master inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB.

In this study, using an experimental mouse model of psoriasis induced by imiquimod (IMQ), we show that oral treatment with a broad spectrum of antibiotics (MIX) or metronidazole (MET) alone mitigates the severity of skin inflammation through downregulation of Th17 immune response in conventional mice. Since some antibiotics, including MET, can influence immune system reactivity, we also evaluated the effect of MIX in the same model under germ-free (GF) conditions. GF mice treated with MET did not show milder signs of imiquimod-induced skin inflammation (IISI) which supports the conclusion that the therapeutic effect is  mediated by changes in microbiota composition. Moreover, compared to controls, mice treated with MIX had a significantly higher abundance of the genus Lactobacillus in the intestine and on the skin. Mice treated with MET had a significantly higher abundance of the genera Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus both on the skin and in the intestine and of Parabacteroides distasonis in the intestine. Additionally, GF mice and mice monocolonized with either Lactobacillus plantarum or segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) were more resistant to IISI than conventional mice. Interestingly, compared to GF mice, IMQ induced a higher  degree of systemic Th17 activation in mice monocolonized with SFB but not with L. plantarum. The present findings provide evidence that intestinal and skin microbiota directly regulates IISI and emphasizes the importance of microbiota in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

Methods: We generated hE-MSCs from embryonic stem cell lines, SNUhES3, and analyzed immune properties of these cells.

Moreover, IMQ-induced inflammatory cytokines; Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ,and IL-27) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23), in the serum and skin showed marked inhibition by hE-MSCs. Conclusion: These results suggested that hE-MSCs have a potency of immune modulation in psoriasis, which might be the key factor for the improved psoriasis."

It has been suggested that distinct affected tissues could exhibit different immune-inflammatory pathways so complicating the  understanding of the physiopathology of psoriatic disease as well as its treatment. Despite of the key pathogenic and clinical relevance that enthesitis has in PsA, peripheral arthritis is more easily perceived. At the macroscopic level, PsA synovitis has predominantly tortuous, bushy vessels, whereas rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by mainly straight, branching vessels  so reflecting prominent neo-angiogenesis in PsA. Synovial biopsies have demonstrated a similar cellular and molecular picture in PsA and RA, although some differences have been reported at the group level, as higher density of vessels, CD163+ macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells in PsA. In fact, synovial IL-17+ mast cells are significantly increased in PsA and produce more IL-17A compared with RA, and a proof of concept study supports its relevant role in the  synovitis of SpA, included PsA. As firstly reported in RA, synovial lymphoid neogenesis is found also in the same proportion of PsA as in RA patients, despite the lack of autoantibodies in PsA. These lymphoid structures are associated with  activation of the IL-23/Th17 pathway in RA and seemly in PsA, which could be useful to stratify RA patients. Immunohistochemical and transcriptomic methodologies have still not found synovial biomarkers useful to distinguish psoriatic from rheumatoid synovitis at the patient level. However, modern methodologies, as MALDI-Mass Spectrometry Imaging, applied to the study of synovial tissue have revealed metabolic and lipid signatures which could support  clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of PsA and RA and to go further toward  the personalized medicine."

In the majority of these conditions, either autoreactive immune cells or the autoantibodies are generated  against self-antigens of the skin. Although the etiology of these diseases remains elusive, biochemical, genetic, and environmental factors such as infectious agents, toxins damage the skin tissue leading to self-antigen generation, autoantibody attack and finally results in autoimmunity of skin. Immune dysregulation, which involves predominantly T helper 1/17 (Th1/Th17) polarization and the inability of regulatory T cells to regress immune response,  is implicated in autoimmune skin diseases. The emerging roles of immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines in the pathogenesis of common autoimmune skin diseases  like pemphigus, vitiligo, and psoriasis are discussed in this review. The main focus is on the interplay between immune cell network including the innate and adaptive immune system, regulatory cells, immune checkpoints and recently identified tissue-resident memory cells (TRMs) in disease pathogenesis and relapse. We also attempt to highlight on the immune mechanisms common to these diseases which can be targeted for designing novel therapeutics."

These effects are mainly mediated by activation of the JAK/STAT, MAPK and PI3K pathways. Some IL-21 target genes, such as B lymphocyte induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), CXCR5 and Bcl-6, play important roles in the immune response. Therefore, IL-21 has been linked to autoimmune diseases. Indeed, IL-21 levels are increased in the peripheral blood and tissues of patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and psoriasis. This increased IL-21 even positively associates with Tfh cells, plasma cells, autoantibodies and disease activity in SLE and RA.  Additionally, IL-21 has been utilized as a therapeutic target in SLE, RA, T1D and psoriatic mouse models. Profoundly, clinical trials have shown safety and improvement in RA patients. However, tolerance and long-term pharmacodynamics effects with low bioavailability have been found in SLE patients. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the latest progress on IL-21 function and its signaling  pathway and discuss the role of IL-21 in the pathogenesis of and therapy for autoimmune diseases, with the hope of providing potential therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for clinical use."

Previously, we showed that exopolysaccharides (EPS-Ca) secreted by Cyanobacterium aponinum, a dominating organism in the Blue Lagoon, increased IL-10 secretion by  human dendritic cells (DCs). In addition, co-culturing allogeneic CD4+ T cells with DCs matured in the presence of EPS-Ca increased differentiation of T cells into T regulatory cells at the cost of the disease inducing Th17 cells. In the present study, EPS-Ca increased the proportion of DCs expressing CD141, a surface molecule linked to regulatory DCs, and the CD141+ cells secreted more IL-10 than  the CD141- cells. EPS-Ca decreased T cell secretion of IL-17, IL-13 and IL-10 and the proportion of T cells expressing the activation marker CD69 that has also been linked to lymphocyte retention. In addition, EPS-Ca reduced keratinocyte secretion of CCL20 and CXCL10, chemokines implicated in recruitment of inflammatory cells. EPS-Ca decreased DC expression of Dectin-1/CLEC7A and SYK, keratinocyte expression of CLEC7A, SYK and CAMP (the gene for LL37), and T cell expression of phosphorylated Zap70. These results indicate that EPS-Ca may induce a regulatory phenotype of DCs, T cells that are less active/inflammatory and less prone to being retained in the skin, and keratinocytes that induce less recruitment of inflammatory cells to the skin and that these effects may be mediated by the effects of EPS-Ca on CLEC7A and SYK. Overall the results indicate that EPS-Ca may be involved in the beneficial effects psoriasis patients experience when bathing in the Blue Lagoon."

Even though psoriasis is one of the most studied dermatological conditions, the pathogenesis of the disease is still not completely elucidated. The complex interactions between keratinocytes, dendritic  cells, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils and mast cells are responsible for the histopathological changes seen in psoriasis. The pathogenic model leading to the  formation of psoriatic plaques has however evolved a lot over the years.

A Systematic Review of Available Evidence.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, appearance of Lewy bodies and presence  of neuroinflammation. No treatments currently exist to prevent PD or delay its progression, and dopaminergic substitution treatments just relieve the consequences of dopaminergic neuron loss. Increasing evidence points to peripheral T lymphocytes as key players in PD, and recently there has been growing interest into the specific role of T helper (Th) 17 lymphocytes. Th17 are a proinflammatory CD4+ T cell lineage named after interleukin (IL)-17, the main cytokine produced by these cells. Th17 are involved in immune-related disease such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and drugs targeting Th17/IL-17 are currently approved for clinical use in such disease. In  the present paper, we first summarized current knowledge about contribution of the peripheral immune system in PD, as well as about the physiopharmacology of Th17 and IL-17 together with its therapeutic relevance. Thereafter, we systematically retrieved and evaluated published evidence about Th17 and IL-17 in PD, to help assessing Th17/IL-17-targeting drugs as potentially novel antiparkinson agents. Critical appraisal of the evidence did not allow to reach definite conclusions: both animal as well as clinical studies are limited, just a few provide mechanistic evidence and none of them investigates the eventual relationship between Th17/IL-17 and clinically relevant endpoints such as disease progression, disability scores, intensity of dopaminergic substitution treatment. Careful assessment of Th17 in PD is anyway a priority, as Th17/IL-17-targeting therapeutics might represent a straightforward opportunity for the unmet needs of PD patients."

Lesional skin of AD contains elevated levels of Th2, Th17, Th22 and Th1-citokines. With a growing movement toward use of targeted therapies, parallel to psoriasis, JAK inhibitors are an important focus of therapeutic research for AD. METHODS: We review current evidence on the efficacy and safety of oral and topical JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AD. RESULTS: Several JAK inhibitors are in phase II and III clinical trials as oral therapies for moderate-to-severe AD or as topical treatments for mild-to-moderate AD. Results thus far are encouraging, with the majority of the patients achieving the primary outcome of their trial as well as a favorable safety profile. DISCUSSION: JAK inhibitors will most certainly be the first oral targeted option  when topical therapy fails. With good oral bioavailability and lack of immunogenicity, they address some of the limitations of biologics. Yet to be defined is whether selective JAK 1 inhibitors or nonselective JAK inhibitors will provide the best equilibrium of efficacy versus side effects. Less clear is the position in the therapeutic ladder for topical JAK inhibitors; although, an unmeet need exists in the topical treatment of AD."

The immune dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of PSO. However, the detail of immune regulation in  PSO is still not very clear. Gαq, the alpha subunit of the Gq protein, played important role in the immune regulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether Gαq was involved in the pathogenesis of PSO. We detected the Gαq expression level and analyzed its relationship with test parameters of PSO patients. Furthermore, we used imiquimod to induce PSO mouse model in Gnaq -/- bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice. The inflammatory cytokines and its correlation with Gαq expression were analyzed both in PSO patients and mice. The results showed that the Gαq expression in PSO patients was much lower and negatively correlated with PSO Area and Severity Index (PASI), CRP, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. In PSO mice models, the skin lesion and keratinocyte proliferation were much more serious in Gnaq -/- BM chimeric mice. Also, the proportions of Th17 cells in Gnaq -/- BM chimeric mice were much higher than WT mice. Furthermore, the IL-17A and TNF-α in Gnaq -/- chimeric mice were also higher. Moreover, IL-17A and TNF-α in PSO patients were negatively associated with the Gαq expression. Our results indicated that Gαq was involved in the pathogenesis of PSO, and its regulation on Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine production might contribute to part of the mechanism of immune dysfunction of PSO."

Innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), perform a critical role in the pathophysiology of  psoriasis by presenting inflammatory/costimulatory signals for differentiation of Th17 cells. Recent studies point to the involvement of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) in inflammatory signaling cascade of DCs. However, it is yet to be determined whether SYK inhibition in DCs would lead to diminishment of psoriatic  inflammation. Therefore, our study evaluated the effects of SYK inhibitor, R406 on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation, expression of costimulatory/inflammatory molecules in DCs and their relationship with Th17/Treg cells. Our data show that R406 causes attenuation of IMQ-induced dermal inflammation as shown by reduction in ear/back skin thickness, acanthosis and myeloperoxidase activity. This was concurrent with reduction in inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in CD11c + DCs such as IL-6, IL-23, MHCII, and CD40. This favoured the suppression of Th17 cells and upregulation of Treg cells in R406-treated mice with psoriasis-like inflammation. Direct activation of TLR7 by IMQ in splenocytic cultures led to increased SYK expression in CD11c + DCs and release of IL-23/IL-6. IMQ-induced IL-6/IL-23 levels were significantly diminished by SYK inhibitor, R406 in splenocytic cultures. In essence, our study shows that SYK inhibition supresses psoriasis-like inflammation by modifying DC function in mice. Further, it implies that SYK inhibition could be a prospective therapeutic approach for the treatment of psoriasis-like inflammation."

IL-23p19 inhibition with risankizumab resulted in superior clinical responses in patients  with psoriasis compared with ustekinumab (dual IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor), but comparative molecular effects have not been established. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the similarities and differences in molecular and histopathologic profiles in skin lesions from patients with psoriasis receiving risankizumab versus ustekinumab at an early time point. METHODS: Lesional skin biopsy samples from 81 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis participating in 2 different studies (a phase I risankizumab study and a phase II study of risankizumab vs ustekinumab) were analyzed by using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Risankizumab induced a rapid decrease in levels of proteins and transcriptomic biomarkers associated with the IL-23 pathway, which were maintained through 8 weeks. At week 4, risankizumab decreased histopathologic expression of biomarkers, including K16, Ki67, CD3, lipocalin-2, CD11c, dendritic cell lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein, β-defensin 2, and S100A7; global  histopathologic scoring revealed that 54% and 69% of patients treated with 90 or  180 mg of risankizumab, respectively, were graded as experiencing excellent improvement versus 29% of patients treated with ustekinumab. At week 4, there was a common decrease in expression of 2645 genes expressed in lesional skin between patients receiving risankizumab and ustekinumab and a significant decrease in 2682 genes unique to risankizumab treatment. Risankizumab more strongly downregulated expression of genes associated with keratinocytes, epidermal cells, and monocytes, versus ustekinumab.

However, blood phenotyping across these subsets is not yet available in patients  with vitiligo. OBJECTIVE: We sought to measure cytokine production by circulating skin-homing (CLA+) versus systemic (CLA-) polar CD4+/CD8+ ratio and activated T-cell subsets in patients with vitiligo compared with patients with AA, AD, or psoriasis and control subjects. METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to measure levels of the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-13, IL-9, IL-17, and IL-22 in CD4+/CD8+ T cells in the blood of 19 patients with moderate-to-severe nonsegmental/generalized vitiligo, moderate-to-severe AA (n = 32), psoriasis (n = 24), or AD (n = 43) and control subjects (n = 30). Unsupervised clustering differentiated subjects into groups based on cellular frequencies. RESULTS: Patients with Vitiligo showed the highest CLA+/CLA- TH1/type 1 cytotoxic T-cell polarization, with parallel TH2/TH9/TH17/TH22 level increases to levels often greater than those seen in patients with AA, AD, or psoriasis (P < .05). Total regulatory T-cell counts were lower in patients with vitiligo than in control subjects and patients with AD or psoriasis (P < .001). Vitiligo severity  correlated with levels of multiple cytokines (P < .1), whereas duration was linked with IFN-γ and IL-17 levels (P < .04). Patients and control subjects grouped into separate clusters based on blood biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Vitiligo is characterized by a multicytokine polarization among circulating skin-homing and systemic subsets, which differentiates it from other  inflammatory/autoimmune skin diseases. Future targeted therapies should delineate the relative contribution of each cytokine axis to disease perpetuation."

Our results showed that administration of MDSCs (1 × 106 or 2 × 106  cells) suppressed the development of IMQ-induced skin inflammation in mice as exemplified by a significant reduction in clinical severity scores and was associated with a reduction of histopathological changes, including inflammatory infiltration, epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. The immunosuppressive effect of MDSCs (1 × 106 or 2 × 106  cells) corresponded to the production of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23) in the serum and dorsal skin. Administration of MDSCs (1 × 106 or 2 × 106  cells) also inhibited splenomegaly.  Moreover, an increased percentage of CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells  and decreased percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells were found in mice treated with MDSCs.

Here we sought to clarify whether and how PSORI-CM02 regulates T cell differentiation and functions in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like BALB/c mouse model. Mice pre-treated 3 days with PSORI-CM02 significantly alleviated skin inflammation, as reduced in PASI score and classic  psoriatic characteristics in pathological sections. CD3 and CD4 positive T cells  were also fewer in the skin lesions of PSORI-CM02 groups, comparing to control group. PSORI-CM02 also decreased pro-inflammatory IFNγ mRNA and IL-17 A mRNA, while increased IL-4 mRNA in mouse skin lesions. In skin draining lymph nodes (DLN), PSORI-CM02 reduced the ratio of γδT cells and inhibited their function of  producing IL-17 A. Nevertheless PSORI-CM02 had no effects on the ratio of total TCRβ+T cells and CD4 + T cells. But it regulated CD4 + T helper cells differentiation, and resulted in the decreasing percentage of IFNγ producing Th1  cells and IL-17 A producing Th17 cells, while increasing the ratio of IL-4 producing Th2 cells in DLN. Further data showed that PSORI-CM02 promote expression of Th2 specific transcript factor GATA3, but had no effects on T-bet and RORγ.

However, the immune landscape in T1D is extremely complex, and the roles played by individual cytokines during disease progression are incompletely understood, making the development of immunotherapies very difficult. In this review, we discuss the complex auxiliary role played by IL-17, both around the islet and in  peripheral tissues such as the gut and kidney, which might influence T1D progression. Through our re-analysis of the key factors involved IL-17 signaling  in recently published single-cell sequencing and sorted-cell bulk sequencing datasets, we find supporting evidence for the general existence of the signaling  apparatus in islet endocrine cells. We also explore the emerging evidence of IL-17 serving as an influential factor in diabetic complications that affect distal tissues. While anti-IL-17 therapies are emerging as an option for psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders, we highlight here a number of questions that would need to be addressed before their potential applicability to treating  T1D can be fully evaluated."

We speculated that an anti-IL-23 receptor mAb might have greater efficacy than an anti-IL-23 mAb in the treatment of local inflamed lesions with high IL-23 levels. We previously generated an anti-human IL-23 receptor mAb, AS2762900-00, which potently blocked IL-23-induced cell proliferation, regardless of the concentration of IL-23. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of AS2762900-00 in the treatment of psoriasis. Compared with untreated control, AS2762900-00 significantly reduced the epidermal thickness of lesions in a clinically relevant psoriatic human skin xenograft model. The expression of inflammatory genes including genes downstream of IL-23 signaling in the lesion tended to be lower in the AS2762900-00 group than the untreated group, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of AS2762900-00 in the psoriatic human skin xenograft model might occur via blockade of IL-23 signaling pathways. Further, AS2762900-00 showed an inhibitory effect on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation as a downstream signal of IL-23 receptor activation in whole blood from patients with psoriasis. We also confirmed that AS2762900-00 inhibited IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner using whole blood from healthy donors. These data suggest that AS2762900-00 is a  promising drug candidate for the treatment of psoriasis. In addition, STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood may be a useful biomarker for the evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effects of AS2762900-00 in healthy volunteers in clinical development."

Among skin-derived  pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-36 family members are highly upregulated in PV patients and play a critical role in general pustular psoriasis. However, there is limited data showing crosstalk between the IL-23 and IL-36 pathways in PV. Herein, potential attenuation of skin inflammation in the IL-23-induced mouse model of psoriasiform dermatitis by functional inhibition of IL-36 receptor (IL-36R) was interrogated. Anti-mouse IL-36R monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated and validated in vitro by inhibiting IL-36α-induced secretion of CXCL1  from NIH 3T3 cells. Antibody target engagement was demonstrated by inhibition of  CXCL1 production in a novel acute model of IL-36α systemic injection in mice. In  addition, anti-IL-36R mAbs inhibited tissue inflammation and inflammatory gene expression in an IL-36α ear injection model of psoriasiform dermatitis demonstrating engagement of the target in the ear skin. To elucidate the possible role of IL-36 signalling in IL-23/Th17 pathway, the ability of anti-IL-36R mAbs to inhibit skin inflammation in an IL-23 ear injection model was assessed. Inhibiting the IL-36 pathway resulted in significant attenuation of skin thickening and psoriasis-relevant gene expression. Taken together, these data suggest a role for IL-36 signalling in the IL-23/Th17 signalling axis in PV."

Extravascular low-density lipoprotein undergoes receptor uptake, whereas high-density lipoprotein (HDL) interacts with cells to acquire cholesterol and then recirculates to plasma. We developed photoactivatable apoA-I to understand how HDL passage through tissue is regulated. We focused on skin and arteries of healthy mice versus those with psoriasis, which carries cardiovascular risk in man. Our findings suggest that psoriasis-affected skin lesions program interleukin-17-producing T cells in draining lymph nodes to home to distal skin and later to arteries. There, these cells mediate thickening of the collagenous matrix, such that larger molecules including lipoproteins become entrapped. HDL transit was rescued by depleting CD4+ T cells, neutralizing interleukin-17, or inhibiting lysyl oxidase that crosslinks collagen. Experimental psoriasis also increased vascular stiffness and atherosclerosis via this common pathway. Thus, interleukin-17 can reduce lipoprotein trafficking and increase vascular stiffness by, at least in part, remodeling collagen."

On the other hand, Th17 cells have a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In this study, we evaluated redox status in memory CD4 + T cells and plasma of patients with psoriasis and its correlation with IL-17 response. To this end, memory T cells were isolated from 10 patients with psoriasis and 10 controls. Intracellular Glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide as well as IL-17  were measured using flow cytometry. Plasma total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) was  quantified by ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay. The expression of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1(SOD1), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2) and cytochrome b-245 beta chain (CYBB) genes were analysed using real-time PCR. Our results showed an increased intracellular ROS production in memory CD4 + T cells of patients compared to controls, (P = 0.04). Furthermore, a significant decrease in expression of catalase gene was found in patients, (P = 0.02). However, no significant differences were observed for intracellular GSH, IL-17 and TAC levels between patients and controls. Also, no correlation was seen between the intracellular IL-17 level and intracellular ROS, GSH and catalase gene expression levels. Collectively, we found an increased ROS production in stimulated memory T cells of patients that could be due to reduced expression of catalase gene. However, it seems that these redox abnormalities have no relationship with IL-17 response in  memory T cells."

Therefore RhoH plays critical roles in the differentiation of T cells; however, the function of RhoH in the effecter phase of the T-cell response has not been fully characterized. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the role of RhoH in inflammatory immune responses and investigated the involvement of RhoH in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. METHODS: We analyzed effector T-cell and systemic inflammation in wild-type and RhoH-null mice. RhoH expression in T cells in human PBMCs was quantified by using RT-PCR. RESULTS: RhoH deficiency in mice induced TH17 polarization during effector T-cell differentiation, thereby inducing psoriasis-like chronic dermatitis. Ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 5 (Ubr5) and nuclear receptor subfamily 2  group F member 6 (Nr2f6) expression levels decreased in RhoH-deficient T cells, resulting in increased protein levels and DNA binding activity of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt. The consequential increase in IL-17 and IL-22 production induced T cells to differentiate into TH17 cells. Furthermore, IL-22 binding protein/Fc chimeric protein reduced psoriatic inflammation in RhoH-deficient mice. Expression of RhoH in T cells was lower in patients with psoriasis with very severe symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that RhoH inhibits TH17 differentiation and thereby plays a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Additionally, IL-22 binding protein has therapeutic potential for the treatment of psoriasis."

METHODS: We conducted a search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases on  22 January 2018 for case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies examining the association between psoriasis and vitiligo. A customized Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for case-control and cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: Of 2453 citations identified from the literature search, 10 case-control/cross-sectional studies with a total of 120,866 psoriasis cases and  79,907 vitiligo cases were included in our study. Four of these studies were rated as high risk of bias. We found a significantly increased odds for vitiligo  in psoriasis patients (summary OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.56-3.37, studies = 7), as well as a significantly elevated odds for psoriasis in vitiligo patients (summary OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.86-6.33, studies = 4). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis showed that psoriasis and vitiligo are associated  with each other. Several studies had a high risk of bias, and further investigation is needed to confirm this association and amplify treatment options."

There is an increased population of Th cells in skin lesions and peripheral circulation of patients with psoriasis. Systemic methotrexate (MTX) is an effective treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis; however, its effect on different T-cell subsets is not yet clear. AIM: To study the effect of MTX monotherapy on the psoriatic T-cell profile in the peripheral circulation of patients with psoriasis. METHODS: This was a follow-up study involving 50 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated with systemic MTX for 12 weeks. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected from participants, from which PBMCs were isolated, and T-cell phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Following 12 weeks of MTX treatment, there was an increase in the percentages of Th2/Treg cells, and a relative decrease in the percentages of Th1/Th17 cells, along with a significant reduction in the median Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). CONCLUSION: MTX helps in the restoration of the immune balance by decreasing the  numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells and increasing the numbers of Th2 and Treg cells, thus resulting in a significant reduction in disease severity. MTX converts a proinflammatory T-cell phenotype to a protective anti-inflammatory phenotype, thus significantly suppressing the inflammation in psoriasis."

It has proven high efficacy for moderate to severe psoriasis but data on its long-term toxicities are limited. We describe two patients who received secukinumab for clinically presumed psoriasis, but were subsequently diagnosed with mycosis fungoides (MF) following skin biopsies triggered by skin deterioration while on secukinumab. Previous studies suggested  decreased numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) with increasing stage of MF, which may lead to the shift in the Treg/Th17 balance towards the Th17 pathway. Theoretically, the use of IL-17 monoclonal antibodies to inhibit Th17 pathway may lead to further immunosuppression and disease progression in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) by shifting the balance towards Tregs, although this hypothesis has not been proven. With uncertainty over the role of IL-17 and Treg/Th17 as well as diagnostic challenges in CTCL, we recommend that patients should have a confirmatory skin biopsy prior to the commencement of biologic therapy."

Gene expression studies in human contact allergy focusing on immune responses revealed nickel being an inducer of T helper (Th)1/Th17 and some Th22 immune polarization, whereas fragrances were found to promote a Th2-dominated immune activation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiological association between contact allergy and psoriasis in a large multicentre cohort and to analyse the sensitization profile to specific allergens in these patients. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patch-tested patients from 56 departments of dermatology (1996-2015), including 2387 patients with psoriasis and 161 989 control patients. All patients with atopic dermatitis were excluded from both groups. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) for contact allergy was calculated to be 0·55 in patients with psoriasis (95% confidence interval 0·50-0·59). Logistic regression  analyses with several independent variables indicated a 'protective effect' of having psoriasis for most allergens, independently of age, sex, affected body site and patch test indication. Fragrance mix II (OR 0·36) and lanolin alcohols (OR 0·38) were found to be among the least common allergens in patients with psoriasis. In contrast, the frequency of contact dermatitis to nickel was only marginally affected in patients with psoriasis compared with controls (OR 0·75). CONCLUSIONS: The inverse association between psoriasis and allergic contact sensitization is likely to be not exclusively mediated by psoriasis itself. The polarization of the activated immune response by specific allergens may influence the occurrence and significance of contact allergies in underlying immune-mediated diseases, eventually even beyond the skin."

However, how IL-23 generates pathogenic TH17 cells remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the involvement, molecular mechanisms, and clinical implications of prostaglandin (PG) E2-EP2/EP4 signaling in induction of  IL-23-driven pathogenic TH17 cells. METHODS: The role of PGE2 in induction of pathogenic TH17 cells was investigated  in mouse TH17 cells in culture in vitro and in an IL-23-induced psoriasis mouse model in vivo. Clinical relevance of the findings in mice was examined by using gene expression profiling of IL-23 and PGE2-EP2/EP4 signaling in psoriatic skin from patients. RESULTS: IL-23 induces Ptgs2, encoding COX2 in TH17 cells, and produces PGE2, which acts back on the PGE receptors EP2 and EP4 in these cells and enhances IL-23-induced expression of an IL-23 receptor subunit gene, Il23r, by activating  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1, and nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) through cyclic AMP-protein kinase A signaling. This PGE2 signaling also induces expression of various inflammation-related genes, which possibly function in TH17 cell-mediated pathology. Combined deletion of EP2 and EP4 selectively in T cells suppressed accumulation of IL-17A+ and IL-17A+IFN-γ+ pathogenic Th17 cells and abolished skin inflammation in an IL-23-induced psoriasis mouse model. Analysis of human psoriatic skin biopsy specimens shows positive correlation between PGE2 signaling and the IL-23/TH17 pathway.

Although genetic mutations are progressively delineated, comprehensive molecular phenotyping of ichthyotic skin could suggest much-needed  pathogenesis-based therapy. OBJECTIVE: We sought to profile the molecular fingerprint of the most common orphan ichthyoses. METHODS: Gene, protein, and serum studies were performed on skin and blood samples from 29 patients (congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, n = 9; lamellar  ichthyosis, n = 8; epidermolytic ichthyosis, n = 8; and Netherton syndrome, n = 4), as well as age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 14), patients with psoriasis (n = 30), and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD; n = 16). RESULTS: Using criteria of a fold change of greater than 2 and a false discovery  rate of less than 0.05, 132 differentially expressed genes were shared commonly among all ichthyoses, including many IL-17 and TNF-α-coregulated genes, which are considered hallmarks of psoriasis (defensin beta 4A, kynureninase, and vanin 3).  Although striking upregulation of TH17 pathway genes (IL17F and IL36B/G) resembling that seen in patients with psoriasis was common to all patients with ichthyoses in a severity-related manner, patients with Netherton syndrome showed  the greatest T-cell activation (inducible costimulator [ICOS]) and a broader immune phenotype with TH1/IFN-γ, OASL, and TH2/IL-4 receptor/IL-5 skewing, although less than seen in patients with AD (all P < .05). Ichthyoses lacked the  epidermal differentiation and tight junction alterations of patients with AD (loricrin, filaggrin, and claudin 1) but showed characteristic alterations in lipid metabolism genes (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3 and galanin), with parallel reductions in extracellular lipids and corneocyte compaction in all ichthyoses except epidermolytic ichthyosis, suggesting phenotypic variations. Transepidermal water loss, a functional barrier measure, significantly correlated with IL-17-regulated gene expression (IL17F and IL36A/IL36B/IL36G). CONCLUSION: Similar to patients with AD and psoriasis, in whom cytokine dysregulation and barrier impairment orchestrate disease phenotypes, psoriasis-like immune dysregulation and lipid alterations characterize the ichthyoses. These data support the testing of IL-17/IL-36-targeted therapeutics for patients with ichthyosis similar to those used in patients with psoriasis."

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by immune and barrier abnormalities and is additionally a risk factor for acquiring ICD and ACD. New work on allergic sensitization to common allergens (e.g., nickel and fragrance) in human skin has shown that different allergens have distinct molecular fingerprinting. For example, nickel promotes strong Th1/Th17 polarization, whereas fragrance allergy causes Th2/Th22 skewing,  which is similar to the phenotype of AD. While ACD has previously been considered to be constant across all allergens, largely based on mouse models involving strong sensitizers, these new data suggest that ACD differs mechanistically according to allergen. Further, ACD in the setting of concurrent AD shows a different and attenuated phenotype as compared to healthy individuals with ACD, which influences the way AD patients respond to vaccination and other treatment modalities. As in contact sensitization, skin challenged by food patch testing shows that common food allergens (e.g., peanut and barley) also cause distinct immune polarizations in the skin. Additionally, house dust mite reactions in human skin have been profiled to show unique Th2, Th9, and Th17/22 activation as  compared to controls, which are similar to the phenotype of psoriasis and contact responses to nickel. Given this information, ACD patients should be treated based on their unique allergen polarity. Refined understanding of the molecular behavior of contact dermatitis and related diseases translates to improved methods of inducing tolerance in sensitized allergic patients, such as with targeted drug therapy and epicutaneous immunotherapy."

The efficacies of this strategic treatment and the standard treatment administered to the other 38 patients were evaluated at 6 months. Results: The 26 patients with PsA in the strategic treatment group were classified into the following four types based on peripheral blood analysis: (i)  CXCR3+CCR6-CD38+HLA-DR+ activated Th1 cell-predominant type, (ii) CXCR3-CCR6+ CD38+HLA-DR+ activated Th17 cell-predominant type, (iii) Th1/Th17-high type and (iv) Th1/Th17-low type.

Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory compound able to induce the expression and production of IL-10 and enhancing its action on a large number of tissues. In vitro and in pre-clinical models curcumin is able to modulate the disease pathophysiology of conditions such as pain and neurodegenerative diseases, bowel inflammation, and allergy, but also of infections and cancer through its effect on IL-10 secretion.
