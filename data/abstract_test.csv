Epub 2018 Apr 18.,Lung adenocarcinoma during pregnancy: clinical case and literature review.,"Lung cancer during pregnancy is a very rare disease with less than 70 cases published to date. Information about specific lung cancer as adenocarcinoma is even more limited. Genetic techniques can detect oncogene mutations which seem to be more frequent among cases of lung cancer in pregnant women and could determine both the treatment and prognosis. We present a recent case seen at our hospital and a literature review.   ""2. Int J Cancer. 2019 Aug 1;145(3):649-661. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32133. Epub 2019 Feb 19.""",ALK,1

This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and robustness of using EBUS-EBNA samples to perform capture-based targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: Tissue samples from patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer were collected by EBUS-TBNA and were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. Three representative genes, EGFR, ALK, and ROS1, were examined by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The remaining samples were processed with NGS assay with a 56-gene panel. Classic driver mutations detected by NGS were verified by conventional methods. RESULTS: Of the 85 samples from patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, 77 were performed successfully with all assays. Forty-one mutations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 were detected in both conventional methods and NGS, representing a 100% concordance. In contrast, four EGFR mutations detected by NGS were not covered in the targeted regions of amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction, leading to a negative call in these patients. Altogether, NGS detected 12 additional variants, including six KRAS mutations, one BRAF mutation, one RET fusion, one MET amplification concurrent with EGFR L858R, one KRAS amplification together with EGFR 19del, and one ERBB2 amplification. The mean number of needle passes per lymph node was 5.2 in samples successfully applied in all assays. CONCLUSIONS: NGS assay can be successfully conducted with limited tissue samples  obtained from EBUS-TBNA. Compared with conventional methods, NGS assay provides more comprehensive information on genetic alterations in tumors, which greatly assists therapeutic decision making for advanced lung cancer.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 May 24.,Clinical implications of an analysis of pharmacokinetics of crizotinib coadministered with dexamethasone in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.,"PURPOSE: Dexamethasone is a systemic corticosteroid and a known cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A inducer. Crizotinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and MET and a substrate of CYP3A. This post hoc analysis characterized the  use of concomitant CYP3A inducers with crizotinib and estimated the effect of dexamethasone use on crizotinib pharmacokinetics at steady state. METHODS: This analysis used data from four clinical studies (PROFILE 1001, 1005,  1007, and 1014) including 1690 patients with non-small cell lung cancer with ALK  or ROS1 rearrangements treated with crizotinib at 250 mg twice daily. Frequency and reasons for use of concomitant CYP3A inducers, including dexamethasone, with  crizotinib were characterized. Multiple steady-state trough concentrations (Ctrough,ss) of crizotinib were measured for each patient. A linear mixed-effects model was used for within-patient comparison of crizotinib Ctrough,ss between dosing of crizotinib alone and crizotinib coadministered with dexamethasone consecutively for ≥ 21 days. RESULTS: Dexamethasone was the most commonly used CYP3A inducer (30.4%). A total  of 15 patients had crizotinib Ctrough,ss for both crizotinib dosing with and without dexamethasone. The adjusted geometric mean ratio of crizotinib Ctrough,ss following coadministration with dexamethasone relative to crizotinib without dexamethasone, as a percentage, was 98.2% (90% confidence interval, 79.1-122.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib plasma exposure following coadministration with dexamethasone was similar to that when crizotinib was administered without dexamethasone, indicating dexamethasone has no effect on crizotinib exposure or efficacy. Other CYP3A inducers with similar potency would likewise have no clinically relevant effect on crizotinib exposure.",ALK,1

Chemotherapy outcomes are little known in this population. METHODS: The French Cooperative Thoracic Intergroup (IFCT) Biomarkers France study was a national prospective cohort study aiming to describe the molecular characteristics and clinical outcome of all consecutive NSCLC patients (N = 17,664) screened for molecular alterations. We used this data set to set up  a case-control analysis. Cases had stage IV BRAF-mutated (BRAF-MT) NSCLC, whereas controls had NSCLC that was wild-type for EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, PIK3CA and ALK. Each case was matched for sex, age at diagnosis and smoking status to two controls randomly selected. RESULTS: Overall, 83 cases with BRAF mutant disease (66.3% V600E) were matched to 166 controls. Five cases received tyrosine kinase inhibition in the first-line and 16 in the second-line. All others were treated with standard chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in first-line and second-line progression-free survival (PFS) between the groups, as well as in the disease control rate, BRAF mutation was not found to be prognostic of overall survival. We found no significant difference in outcome between the treatment types used in first-line or second-line in patients with BRAF-MT disease compared with controls nor between BRAF V600E or non-V600E compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF mutation is not a strong prognostic factor in NSCLC. Although taxan-based therapy shows poorest PFS in first-line, no chemotherapy regimen was  associated with prognosis.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 May 23.,Anaplastic lymphoma kinase expression in small-cell lung cancer.,"AIMS: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) immunohistochemistry has shifted from being a screening tool to being a sole determinant for ALK-targeted therapy. Recent articles have referred to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation as  a resistance mechanism after ALK inhibitor treatments, but few reports have addressed ALK expression in treatment-naive SCLC in a comprehensive manner. Therefore, we examined ALK expression and the mechanisms in treatment-naive SCLCs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined ALK expression in a consecutive series of SCLC tumours, and the expression mechanism was analysed regarding gene rearrangement,  copy number changes, and point mutations. We also examined whether SCLC with ALK  expression can be suppressed by crizotinib treatment in vitro. Immunohistochemical results revealed that ALK was expressed in 16 of 142 (11.3%)  SCLCs. The expression was focal and less intense, which is in contrast to strong  and uniform expression in adenocarcinoma with ALK rearrangement. Two combined SCLCs showed a positive reaction restricted to the SCLC component. None of the known genetic alterations, including rearrangement, amplification, copy number gain, or point mutations, were associated with ALK expression. A SCLC cell line,  SKLC2, which expressed ALK without known genetic alterations, was not inhibited by a practically achievable serum concentration of crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase immunohistochemistry for treatment-naive  SCLCs should not be used as a predictive biomarker for ALK inhibitor therapy, because the positive reactions were due to intrinsic expression of normal ALK transcript.",ALK,1

Methods: The Kaplan-Meier rwToT was estimated from electronic health record data for adults who initiated first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for stage IV, PD-L1 TPS ≥50% NSCLC, with negative/unknown EGFR/ALK aberrations, and ≥6 months' follow-up until database cutoff. Results: A total of 386 patients with ECOG 0-1 had a median rwToT of 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6-8.3) and 12-month on-treatment rate of 36.4% (31.2-41.6) versus 40.3% (32.5-47.9) and 37.6% (31.9-43.4) in KEYNOTE-024 (KN024) and KN042 (stage IV/TPS ≥50% subpopulation), respectively. The 24-month restricted-mean rwTOT (extrapolated) was 10.5 months (9.4-11.7), versus 11.0 (9.5-12.5) and 10.4 (9.3-11.5) in KN024 and KN042, respectively. Conclusion: First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy rwToT in metastatic PD-L1 TPS ≥50% NSCLC for trial-matched patients is similar to treatment duration in KN024 and KN042.",ALK,1

However, the optimal technique for maximizing yield continues to vary in the real-world setting. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA with capillary sampling compared with complete stylet removal for molecular testing. METHODS: Retrospective study, data from patients between January to May 2017 with indication of EBUS-TBNA whom ancillary testing, that is, next-generation sequencing, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and programed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression was reviewed. The yield of 2 techniques, stylet retracted halfway (group 1) versus complete retraction (group 2), was compared. RESULTS: A total of 24/27 (88.88%) samples were adequate for next-generation sequencing analysis in group 1 and 21/23 (91.30%) in group 2. For other molecular analyses, 24/27 (88.88%) samples in group 1 and 20/23 (86.95%) samples in group 2 were adequate for ALK analysis. 23/27 (85.18%) samples for group 1 and 20/23 (86.95%) samples for group 2 were adequate for PD-L1 analysis. Positive expression of PD-L1>50% was achieved in 9/23 (39.13%) of group 1 and 5/20 (25%) of group 2. There was no statistical difference in the yield between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: EBUS-TBNA using either capillary sampling or complete stylet removal  are effective and has a high proportion of satisfactory results for ancillary testing.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Jun 20.,A case report: Pharmacology and resistance patterns of three generations of ALK inhibitors in metastatic inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma.,"BACKGROUND: Little exists currently in research about the mechanisms of resistance of ALK inhibitors in inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma. It is known, however, that ALK gene rearrangements are common in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, similar to non-small cell lung cancer. In roughly 50% of  inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, gene rearrangement has been found to occur on chromosome 2 at band 2p23. In non-small cell lung cancer, it has been shown that about a third of patients who progress on the first generation ALK inhibitor, crizotinib develops mutations in the ALK kinase domain. The remaining  two-thirds of patients tend to develop amplification of ALK or activation of alternative signaling pathways. Chromoplexy has also been described as a mechanism of resistance, where multiple closed chain rearrangements cause loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes and gain-in-function of oncogenic fusions. Partner genes that have been identified in IMTs are tropomyosin 3 (TPM3), tropomyosin 4 (TPM4), clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), Ran-binding protein 2  (RANBP2), cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS), 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), and SEC31L1. All are  active promoters for the fusion gene, in response to NPM binding. Several inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor case reports indicated that fusion of ALK and  RANBP2 led to a more aggressive clinical course. Although the majority of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor case reports have utilized first and second generation ALK inhibitors, all generations of ALK inhibitors have demonstrated some ability to impair disease progression and extend life expectancy. However, at some point in the course of therapy with each generation of ALK inhibitor, resistance ultimately developed. In order to better understand the pharmacology and resistance patterns behind three generations of ALK inhibitors, we sought to  examine a patient with metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1-rearranged inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma to the brain. We also explored the similarities and differences of this clinical case to other inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma case reports involving the use of ALK inhibitors. CASE REPORT: A rare case of pulmonary IMS with ALK-1 gene rearrangement and multiple brain metastases responded to three generations of ALK inhibitors. However, similar to other case reports, due to the development of resistance and  recurrence, the patient eventually succumbed to the disease. CONCLUSIONS: ALK inhibitors are beneficial in the temporary prevention of progression of disease in patients with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. In this case, due to the inability to reveal the fusion partner in this patient via  DNA sequencing, it is unknown exactly if that partner was RANBP2 or another ALK partner gene. Brain biopsy tissue was also unobtainable during sequence of ALK due to risk versus benefit, which would have provided insight as which type of ALK resistance mutations the patient was developing. It is likely that this patient had some form of chromoplexy occurring.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Apr 9.,The Landscape of Actionable Molecular Alterations in Immunomarker-Defined Large-Cell Carcinoma of the Lung.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with pulmonary large-cell carcinoma (LCC) have poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The identification of clinically actionable molecular alterations helps to guide personalized cancer treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A consecutive cohort of 789 resected NSCLC cases were reviewed. Fifty-nine NSCLC cases lacking morphologic differentiation, accounting  for 7.5% of all resected NSCLCs, were identified and further characterized by immunohistochemistry according to the 2015 WHO lung tumor classification. Molecular alterations were investigated by multiple technologies including target capture sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridizations. RESULTS: Of 59 NSCLC cases lacking morphologic differentiation, 20 (33.9%) were reclassified as adenocarcinoma (LCC-AD), 14 (23.7%) as squamous cell carcinoma (LCC-SqCC), and 25 (42.4%) as LCC-Null. Approximately 92% of LCC-Null, 95% of LCC-AD, and 86% of LCC-SqCC harbored clinically relevant alterations. Alterations characteristic of adenocarcinoma (EGFR, KRAS, ALK receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK], ROS1, and serine/threonine kinase 11 [STK11]) were detected in the LCC-AD subgroup but not in LCC-SqCC, whereas squamous-lineage alterations (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha [PIK3CA],  SRY-box 2 [SOX2], fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 [FGFR1], and AKT1) were detected in the LCC-SqCC subgroup but not in the LCC-AD group. Although some LCC-Null tumors displayed a genetic profile similar to either adenocarcinoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, more than half of the LCC-Null group were completely devoid of recognizable lineage-specific genetic profiles. High programmed death ligand 1 expression and high frequency of cell cycle regulatory gene alterations  were found in the LCC-Null group offering alternative options of targeted therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive molecular study provided further insight into the genetic architecture of LCC. The presence of clinically actionable alterations in a majority of the tumors allowed personalized treatment to emerge.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Mar 20.,Updated Efficacy and Safety Data and Impact of the EML4-ALK Fusion Variant on the Efficacy of Alectinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Global Phase III ALEX Study.,"INTRODUCTION: At the prior data cutoff (February 9, 2017) the ALEX trial showed superior investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) for alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001). The median PFS in the alectinib arm was not reached versus 11.1 months with crizotinib. Retrospective analyses suggest that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-ALK variant (EML4-ALK) may influence ALK-inhibitor treatment benefit. We present updated analyses, including exploratory subgroup analysis by EML4-ALK variant, after an additional 10 months' follow-up (cutoff December 1, 2017). METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib, 600 mg, or crizotinib, 250 mg, until disease progression, toxicity, death, or withdrawal. PFS was determined by the investigators. Baseline plasma and tissue biomarker samples were analyzed by using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing to determine EML4-ALK variant. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were balanced. Investigator-assessed PFS was prolonged with alectinib (stratified hazard ratio = 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.58). The median PFS times were 34.8 months with alectinib and 10.9 months with crizotinib. EML4-ALK fusions were detectable in 129 patient  plasma samples and 124 tissue samples; variants 1, 2, and 3/ab did not affect PFS, objective response rate, or duration of response. Investigator-assessed PFS  was longer for alectinib than for crizotinib across EML4-ALK variants 1, 2, and 3a/b in plasma and tissue. Despite longer treatment duration (27.0 months in the  case of alectinib versus 10.8 months in the case of crizotinib), the safety of alectinib compared favorably with that of crizotinib. CONCLUSION: Alectinib continues to demonstrate superior investigator-assessed PFS versus crizotinib in untreated ALK-positive NSCLC, irrespective of EML4-ALK variant.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 May 20.,"Atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment for metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (IMpower130): a multicentre, randomised,  open-label, phase 3 trial.","BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab (a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1), which restores anticancer immunity, improved overall survival in patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer and also showed clinical benefit when combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. IMpower130 aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy for non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: IMpower130 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done in 131 centres across eight countries (the USA, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Israel). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1,  and received no previous chemotherapy for stage IV disease. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1; permuted block [block size of six] with an interactive voice or web response system) to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (carboplatin [area under the curve 6 mg/mL per min every 3 weeks] plus nab-paclitaxel [100 mg/m2 intravenously every week]) or chemotherapy alone for four or six 21-day cycles followed by maintenance therapy. Stratification factors were sex, baseline liver metastases, and PD-L1 tumour expression. Co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat wild-type (ie, EGFRwt and ALKwt) population. The safety population included patients who received at least  one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02367781. FINDINGS: Between April 16, 2015, and Feb 13, 2017, 724 patients were randomly assigned and 723 were included in the intention-to-treat population (one patient  died before randomisation, but was assigned to a treatment group; this patient was excluded from the intention-to-treat population) of the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group (483 patients in the intention-to-treat population and 451 patients in the intention-to-treat wild-type population) or the chemotherapy group (240 patients in the intention-to-treat population and 228 patients in the  intention-to-treat wild-type population). Median follow-up in the intention-to-treat wild-type population was similar between groups (18·5 months [IQR 15·2-23·6] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 19·2 months [15·4-23·0] in the chemotherapy group). In the intention-to-treat wild-type population, there were significant improvements in median overall survival (18·6  months [95% CI 16·0-21·2] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 13·9 months [12·0-18·7] in the chemotherapy group; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·79 [95% CI 0·64-0·98]; p=0·033) and median progression-free survival (7·0 months [95% CI 6·2-7·3] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 5·5 months [4·4-5·9] in the chemotherapy group; stratified HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·54-0·77]; p<0·0001]). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (152 [32%] of 473 in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group vs 65 [28%] of 232 in the chemotherapy group), anaemia (138 [29%] vs 47 [20%]), and  decreased neutrophil count (57 [12%] vs 19 [8%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 112 (24%) of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 30 (13%) of 232 patients in the chemotherapy group. Treatment-related (any treatment) deaths occurred in eight (2%) of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and one (<1%) of 232 patients in the  chemotherapy group. INTERPRETATION: IMpower130 showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival and a significant improvement in progression-free survival with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment of patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and no ALK or EGFR mutations. No new safety signals were identified. This study supports the benefit of atezolizumab, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, as first-line treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.",ALK,1

Although ROS1-rearranged tumors are known to have characteristic histologic features, only a few studies have investigated the histologic features of advanced-stage ROS1-rearranged tumors. METHODS: We analyzed the histopathologic features of ROS1-rearranged tumors in advanced-stage NSCLC patients and assessed the ROS1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining patterns of ROS1-rearranged cases. RESULTS: A total of 37 ROS1 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-positive cases and 64 ROS1 FISH-negative cases were analyzed, and all tumors were EGFR-, ALK-, and RET-negative. Solid pattern, round nuclei with macronucleoli, solid signet-ring cells, extracellular mucin, and a close relation with adjacent bronchioles were significantly associated with ROS1 rearrangement, and the solid  signet-ring cell feature was exclusively identified in ROS1-rearranged tumors. ROS1 IHC showed a 97.3% sensitivity when weak to strong protein expression was considered positive. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight distinct histologic features of ROS1-rearranged tumors, including their nuclear features. A thorough understanding of ROS1 rearrangement-related histologic features would be helpful  to identify ROS1-rearranged tumors in advanced-stage NSCLC",ALK,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of 106 patients (pts) from five Institutions treated with RT concomitant to TKI were retrospectively revised. Overall survival (OS) and toxicities were analyzed as endpoints of the study. RESULTS: Median age of pts was 65 years. TKIs were given for EGFR (81%)- or ALK (19%)-mutated metastatic NSCLC. Stereotactic RT (SRT) was delivered to 49 pts (46%). Patients with four or less metastasis were defined as oligometastatic/oligoprogressive (OM/OP); sites of RT were brain, bone, lung or others in 46%, 27%, 14% and 13%, respectively. Median OS was 23 months. At univariate analysis SRT, ECOG PS 0-1, OM/OP disease, lung sites and a TKI duration longer than median favorably affected OS (all p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed SRT (HR 0.355, CI 95% 0.212-0.595; p < 0.001) and median duration of TKI > 14 months (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.10-0.30; p < 0.001) as independent factors related to better OS. Toxicities were rare. CONCLUSIONS: SRT seems to positively affect OS with limited toxicity in selected  patients.",ALK,1

Epub 2019  Jun 18.,The prognostic implications of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement for the long-term outcomes of patients with resected lung adenocarcinomas.,"BACKGROUND: To investigate the prognostic impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement for the overall survival (OS) of patients with surgically treated lung adenocarcinomas. METHODS: A total of 689 patients with stage I-III lung adenocarcinomas (male:female = 334:355; median age, 64 years) underwent complete surgical resection between 2007 and 2013. The prognostic impact of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement on OS was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Certain clinicopathological prognostic factors (i.e., age, sex, smoking status, nodule type, solid portion size, pathologic stage, adenocarcinoma subtype, and history of adjuvant chemotherapy) were included for adjustments of the hazard ratio (HR). RESULTS: EGFR mutation was observed in 438 patients (64%) and ALK rearrangement was seen in 28 patients (4%). Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression demonstrated  that the prognostic effect of EGFR mutation on OS differed by age (HR, exp.[-5.199 + 0.064* age]). The adjusted HR for EGFR mutation was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.05-0.36; P < 0.001) at 50 years, 0.26 (95% CI: 0.15-0.46; P < 0.001) at 60 years, and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.31-0.81; P = 0.005) at 70 years. However, the effect of ALK rearrangement on OS was without statistical significance (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EGFR mutation was independently prognostic of the long-term outcomes of patients with surgically treated lung adenocarcinomas. A more favorable prognostic effect was seen in younger than in older patients. ALK rearrangement was not associated with OS.",ALK,1

However, the real-world evaluation status of ALK/EGFR in China remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study including 1134 patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC (stage IIIb-IV) at 12 Chinese hospitals. RESULTS: The most common evaluation methods were amplification-refractory mutation system for EGFR status and immunohistochemistry targeting D5F3 for ALK status. Among patients with non-squamous, the EGFR mutation rate was 44.1% and the ALK rearrangement rate was 10.0%. Among patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the EGFR mutation rate was 8.3% and the ALK rearrangement rate was 3.7%. Among all patients, gender (HR = 1.7, 95%CI = 1.2-2.4, P = 0.006), smoking  history (HR = 1.8, 95%CI = 1.3-2.7, P = 0.001), histology (HR = 5.0, 95%CI = 2.4-10.1, P < 0.001), and brain metastases (HR = 1.5, 95%CI = 1.1-2.2, P = 0.017) were independent predictors of EGFR mutation, while age (HR = 2.6, 95%CI = 1.7-4.1, P < 0.001) was an independent predictor of ALK rearrangement. The median time from tumor diagnosis to EGFR or ALK status confirmation was 7 and 5 days, respectively. Targeted therapy rate was 73.8% in EGFR-positive patients and 51.4% in ALK-positive patients. There was a negative correlation between the first-line targeted therapy rate and the EGFR mutation detection period (r = -0.152, P = 0.02), while no significant correlation among patients with ALK rearrangement (r  = -0.179, P = 0.076). CONCLUSION: Squamous NSCLC patients should also be routinely tested to determine  their EGFR/ALK statuses. The first-line targeted therapy rate remains low in Chinese patients with NSCLC.",ALK,1

Currently, different targeted therapies and ROS1 inhibitors have been discovered, but all are in different investigational phases, with only one (crizotinib) which is FDA approved. Crizotinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which was discovered to actively inhibit ALK, MET, and ROS1. Crizotinib has shown to be remarkably efficacious against ROS1 lung cancer, prompting ROS1 detection in lung cancer to be quite significant. Sadly, crizotinib resistance in ROS1 is a frequent occurrence which poses a major clinical challenge in the successful treatment of ROS1 lung cancer; hence, the discovery of the second and third generation ROS1 inhibitors is of utmost importance. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms through which ROS1 tumor cells acquire resistance to crizotinib-the first-line drug for ROS1-positive NSCLC, and summarize various new potent drugs which can overcome this resistance and serve as viable alternatives.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],"Design, synthesis and biological evaluations of 2-amino-4-(1-piperidine) pyridine derivatives as novel anti crizotinib-resistant ALK/ROS1 dual inhibitors.","ALK and ROS1 kinases have become promising therapeutic targets since Crizotinib was used to treat non-small-cell lung cancer clinically. Aiming to explore new potent inhibitors, a series of 2-amino-4-(1-piperidine) pyridine derivatives that stabilized a novel DFG-shifted conformation in the kinase domain of ALK were designed and synthesized on the base of lead compound A. Biological evaluation highlighted that most of these new compounds could also potently inhibit ROS1 kinase, leading to the promising inhibitors against both ROS1 and ALK. Among them, the representative compound 2e stood out potent anti-proliferative activity against ALK-addicted H3122 and ROS1-addicted HCC78 cell lines (IC50 = 6.27 μM and 10.71 μM, respectively), which were comparable to that of Crizotinib. Moreover, 2e showed impressive enzyme activity against clinically Crizotinib-resistant ALKL1196M with an IC50 value of 41.3 nM, which was about 2-fold more potent than  that of Crizotinib. 2e also showed potent inhibitory activity in about 6-fold superior to Crizotinib (IC50: 104.7 nM vs. 643.5 nM) in Ba/F3 cell line harboring ROS1G2032R. Furthermore, molecular modeling disclosed that all the representative inhibitors could dock into the active site of ALK and ROS1, which gave a probable explanation of anti Crizotinib-resistant mutants. These results indicated that our work has established a path forward for the generation of anti Crizotinib-resistant ALK/ROS1 dual inhibitors",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of  print],Converting EORTC QLQ-C30 scores to utility scores in the brigatinib ALTA study.,"Aims: Health utilities summarize a patient's overall health status. This study estimated utilities based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQ-C30), a widely used measure  of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in oncology, using published mapping algorithms. Materials and methods: Data were from the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase  (ALK) in Lung Cancer Trial of brigatinib (ALTA; NCT02094573), an open-label, international, phase 2 study. ALTA evaluated the efficacy and safety of two randomized dosing regimens of brigatinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK + non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed on prior  therapy with crizotinib. QLQ-C30 scores were mapped to European Quality-of-Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) utility scores using two published algorithms (Khan et al. for EQ-5D-5L; Longworth et al. for EQ-5D-3L). The impact of brigatinib treatment on health utilities over time was assessed. Results: The analysis included 208 subjects. Mean baseline utility scores for both algorithms ranged between 0.60 - 0.71 and increased to 0.78 by cycle 5. Utility improvements were sustained during most of the treatment, before disease progression. Minor variations were observed between utility scores; Khan et al. estimates were approximately 0.01 or 0.02 points lower than Longworth et al. estimates. Limitations: Algorithms considered were limited to those available in the published literature at the time of the study. This utility analysis was exploratory, and the ALTA trial did  not include an internal control group (i.e. standard of care) and was not powered to detect differences in QoL/utility outcomes between treatment arms. Conclusions: Converting QLQ-C30 scores into utilities in trials using established mapping algorithms can improve evaluation of medicines from the patient perspective. Both algorithms suggested that brigatinib improved health utility in crizotinib-refractory ALK + NSCLC patients, and improvements were maintained during most of the treatment.

Here we present our experience on pneumonic-type lung carcinoma in an attempt to investigate the clinical, radiological and pathological features, diagnostic procedures, treatment, and prognosis of this type of tumor. METHODS: Pathologically confirmed lung cancer with a chest CT characterized by ground glass opacity or consolidation was defined as pneumonic-type lung carcinoma. Cases with advanced pneumonic-type lung carcinoma admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) from January 1, 2013 to August 30, 2018 were enrolled. Retrospective analysis of clinical data and survival follow-up of  these patients was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 46 cases were enrolled, all of which were adenocarcinoma. Cough (41/46, 89.1%) and expectoration (35/46, 76.1%) were the most prominent symptoms. The most frequent chest CT findings were ground glass attenuation (87.0%), patchy consolidation (84.8%), and multiple ground-glass nodules (84.8%). Multiple cystic changes (40%) and cavitation (13%) were also quite frequent. Ipsilateral and contralateral intrapulmonary metastasis were noted in 95.3% and 84.8% of cases respectively. The median duration from symptom onset to diagnosis  was 214 days (95%CI: 129-298). Both surgical lung biopsy and CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy had a diagnostic yield of 100%. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) combined with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) had a diagnostic yield of 80.9% (17/21). Sputum cytology had a diagnostic yield of 45% (9/20). Twenty-six cases were invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (26/46, 56.5%) and the remainder were unable to identify pathological subtypes due to lack of adequate biopsy sample size. EGFR mutation was detected in 15.8% (6/38) of patients and ALK rearrangement was detected in 3.0% (1/33) of patients. The median overall survival for these patients was 522 d (95%CI: 424-619). In patients without EGFR  mutation or ALK rearrangement, chemotherapy significantly improved survival (HR=0.155, P=0.002,2). The median overall survival was 547 d (95%CI: 492-602 d) with chemotherapy and 331 d (95%CI: 22-919) without chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of pneumonic-type carcinoma is usually delayed due to clinical and radiological features mimicking pulmonary infection. TBLB combined with BAL has a quite high diagnostic yield. The most frequent histological type is invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma. The incidence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement is low in pneumonic-type carcinoma. For patients without cancer driver genes, chemotherapy is recommended to improve overall survival.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of  print],Validation of a Next-Generation Sequencing Assay Targeting RNA for the Multiplexed Detection of Fusion Transcripts and Oncogenic Isoforms.,"CONTEXT.—: Next-generation sequencing is a high-throughput method for detecting genetic abnormalities and providing prognostic and therapeutic information for patients with cancer. Oncogenic fusion transcripts are among the various classifications of genetic abnormalities present in tumors and are typically detected clinically with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, FISH probes only exist for a limited number of targets, do not provide any information about fusion partners, cannot be multiplex, and have been shown to be limited in  specificity for common targets such as ALK. OBJECTIVE.—: To validate an anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based panel for the detection of fusion transcripts in a university hospital-based clinical molecular diagnostics laboratory. DESIGN.—: We used 109 unique clinical specimens to validate a custom panel targeting 104 exon boundaries from 17 genes involved in fusions in solid tumors.  The panel can accept as little as 100 ng of total nucleic acid from PreservCyt-fixed tissue, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens with as  little as 10% tumor nuclei. RESULTS.—: Using FISH as the gold standard, this assay has a sensitivity of 88.46% and a specificity of 95.83% for the detection of fusion transcripts involving ALK, RET, and ROS1 in lung adenocarcinomas. Using a validated next-generation sequencing assay as the orthogonal gold standard for the detection of EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) in glioblastomas, the assay is 92.31% sensitive and 100% specific. CONCLUSIONS.—: This multiplexed assay is tumor and fusion partner agnostic and will provide clinical utility in therapy selection for patients with solid tumors.",ALK,1

Cancer cell heterogeneity and primary or acquired resistance mechanisms cause the elusive behaviour of this cancer and new biomarkers and active drugs are urgently needed to overcome these limitations. p65BTK, a novel isoform of the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase may represent a new actionable target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: p65BTK expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 382 NSCLC patients with complete clinico-pathological records including smoking habit, ALK  and EGFR status, and in metastatic lymph nodes of 30 NSCLC patients. NSCLC cell lines mutated for p53 and/or a component of the RAS/MAPK pathway and primary lung cancer-derived cells from Kras/Trp53 null mice were used as a preclinical model.  The effects of p65BTK inhibition by BTK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) (Ibrutinib, AVL-292, RN486) and first-generation EGFR-TKIs (Gefitinib, Erlotinib) on cell viability were evaluated by MTT. The effects of BTK-TKIs on cell growth and clonogenicity were assessed by crystal violet and colony assays, respectively. Cell toxicity assays were performed to study the effect of the combination of non-toxic concentrations of BTK-TKIs with EGFR-TKIs and standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Gemcitabine, Pemetrexed). RESULTS: p65BTK was significantly over-expressed in EGFR-wild type (wt) adenocarcinomas (AdC) from non-smoker patients and its expression was also preserved at the metastatic site. p65BTK was also over-expressed in cell lines mutated for KRAS or for a component of the RAS/MAPK pathway and in tumors from Kras/Trp53 null mice. BTK-TKIs were more effective than EGFR-TKIs in decreasing cancer cell viability and significantly impaired cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Moreover, non-toxic doses of BTK-TKIs re-sensitized drug-resistant NSCLC cell lines to both target- and SOC therapy, independently from EGFR/KRAS status. CONCLUSIONS: p65BTK results as an emerging actionable target in non-smoking EGFR-wt AdC, also at advanced stages of disease. Notably, these patients are not  eligible for EGFR-TKIs-based therapy due to a lack of EGFR mutation. The combination of BTK-TKIs with EGFR-TKIs is cytotoxic for EGFR-wt/KRAS-mutant/p53-null tumors and BTK-TKIs re-sensitizes drug-resistant NSCLC to SOC chemotherapy. Therefore, our data suggest that adding BTK-TKIs to SOC chemotherapy and EGFR-targeted therapy may open new avenues for clinical trials in currently untreatable NSCLC.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 May 30.,Tracing Oncogene Rearrangements in the Mutational History of Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"Mutational processes giving rise to lung adenocarcinomas (LADCs) in non-smokers remain elusive. We analyzed 138 LADC whole genomes, including 83 cases with minimal contribution of smoking-associated mutational signature. Genomic rearrangements were not correlated with smoking-associated mutations and frequently served as driver events of smoking-signature-low LADCs. Complex genomic rearrangements, including chromothripsis and chromoplexy, generated 74% of known fusion oncogenes, including EML4-ALK, CD74-ROS1, and KIF5B-RET. Unlike other collateral rearrangements, these fusion-oncogene-associated rearrangements  were frequently copy-number-balanced, representing a genomic signature of early oncogenesis. Analysis of mutation timing revealed that fusions and point mutations of canonical oncogenes were often acquired in the early decades of life. During a long latency, cancer-related genes were disrupted or amplified by  complex rearrangements. The genomic landscape was different between subgroups-EGFR-mutant LADCs had frequent whole-genome duplications with p53 mutations, whereas fusion-oncogene-driven LADCs had frequent SETD2 mutations. Our study highlights LADC oncogenesis driven by endogenous mutational processes.",ALK,1

In patients with oncogenic addiction, targeted therapy remains clearly the best option, and the place of immunotherapy in this population has not been clearly defined yet.Based on available data, we suggest that (i) immunotherapy single agent should be proposed only after exhaustion of more validated treatments, (ii) combinations of immunotherapy with targeted therapies are of interest provided that we can manage toxicity and find the best  sequence, (iii) a combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy may be appealing in patients pretreated with targeted agents. The best way to opt in for the best  strategy will depend upon the identification of adequate biomarkers. New basic and clinical research is awaited in this field.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Impact of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Starting Dose on Outcomes in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can cause intolerable adverse events in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and may be prescribed  at a lower dose. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyze the starting doses of oral EGFR and ALK TKIs in patients diagnosed with NSCLC at our institution. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review with patients on EGFR and ALK  TKIs for NSCLC. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: patients initiated on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standard dose (SD) and patients initiated on a reduced dose (RD). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and other treatment outcomes were compared between both groups. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included for analysis. The median time-to-progression for the SD group (n = 67) and RD group (n = 23) were 13.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]:8.9-15.6) and 15.1 months (95%CI: 5.6-21.5), respectively. Median time-to-death was not estimable for OS. The predicted OS probability at approximately 15 months post treatment initiation for the SD group and RD group was 81.8% and 80.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients who initiated TKI therapy at a RD did not have different PFS and 15-month survival outcomes than patients who initiated TKI therapy at the FDA SD.",ALK,1

Print 2019 Jun.,Targeting SLMAP-ALK-a novel gene fusion in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Assessment of ALK gene rearrangements is strongly recommended by the Molecular Testing Guideline for Selection of Lung Cancer Patients proposed by IASLC, AMP, and CAP at the time of diagnosis for patients with advanced stage disease. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ALK gene rearrangements or the resulting  fusion proteins have been, for the most part, successfully targeted with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The most frequent rearrangement, the EML4-ALK  oncogenic fusion, has more than 10 distinct variants, each with a discrete breakpoint in EML4 Recent studies have suggested that EML4-ALK variants may have  differential responses to TKIs. Additionally, non-EML4-ALK fusions that result from ALK rearrangements with diverse 5' partners could possibly have varied biologic and clinical implications in their therapeutic responses and outcomes of patients with NSCLC. Existing literature documents at least 20 non-EML4 fusion partners for ALK, and the clinical responsiveness to crizotinib ranges from increased sensitivity to resistance. This underscores the importance of identifying the precise 5' fusion partner to ALK before initiation of therapy. Herein we report the identification of a novel SLMAP-ALK fusion in a patient with NSCLC.",ALK,1

METHODS: We evaluated 173 specimens obtained from patients with lung adenocarcinoma in northeastern Brazil. Expression of PD-L1 and ALK was evaluated  by immunohistochemistry; EGFR mutation status was evaluated by sequencing. We categorized the histological subtypes in accordance with the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification. RESULTS: The most common histological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma were solid  predominant (in 46.8%), acinar predominant (in 37.0%), and lepidic predominant (in 9.8%). ALK expression was detected in 10.4% of the samples, and 22.0% of the  tumors harbored EGFR mutations. The most common EGFR mutation was an exon 21 L858R point mutation (in 45.5%), followed by an exon 19 deletion (in 36.3%). The  tumor proportion score for PD-L1 expression was ≥ 50% in 18.2% of the samples, 1-49% in 32.7%, and 0% in 49.5%. The solid predominant subtype was significantly  associated with wild-type EGFR status (p = 0.047). Positivity for PD-L1 expression was not found to be significantly associated with ALK expression or EGFR mutation status. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the molecular profile of non-small cell lung cancer in northeastern Brazil differs from those of populations in other regions of the country, with ALK positivity being higher than the other biomarkers. Further studies including clinical and genetic information are required to confirm these differences, as well as studies focusing on populations living in different areas of the country.",ALK,1

Epub 2019  Jan 30., [Detection of ALK and ROS1 rearrangements by immunocytochemistry on cytological,"The identification of ALK and ROS1 rearrangements has become essential for the theranostic management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, especially in stage IV or inoperable patients. These testings are now performed by immunohistochemistry on histological samples and confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization in case of positive or doubtful results. The diagnosis of lung cancer is often performed at an advanced or metastatic stage and cytological sample could be the only material containing malignant cells available at these stages. Therefore, the detection of ALK and ROS1 rearrangement by immunocytochemical analysis on cytological specimens is needed. We performed this test on 27 cytological samples of lung adenocarcinomas, and we compared our results with several other techniques: on the same sample or on biopsy in another laboratory, on the same sample by fluorescent in situ hybridization and/or immunochemistry. We found a very good concordance between all these techniques, thus validating our immunocytochemical method on cytological samples according to the ISO 15189 norm",ALK,1

DATA SOURCES: A literature search using PubMed was conducted using the terms brigatinib and ALK positive NSCLC from January 2013 to November 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles evaluating brigatinib were analyzed for this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Brigatinib was granted approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. It is administered at a dose of 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days then, if tolerated, increased to a dose of 180 mg orally once daily. Common adverse effects include nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, increased creatine phosphokinase levels, headache, dyspnea, and hypertension. Serious treatment-emergent adverse effects were pulmonary related. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This article discusses the clinical trials that led to the accelerated approval of brigatinib for its ability to overcome crizotinib-resistant mutations and for its increased central nervous system penetration properties. CONCLUSION: Brigatinib was granted accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. In a subset of NSCLC patients, brigatinib increases survival for approximately 1 year; however, side effects were detected.",ALK,1

A  41-year-old never-smoking man who presented with asthma attack was found to have  a suspicious lesion on chest X-ray after. Pathological examination was consistent with ALK(+), the signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma. Surgery was not performed because of mediastinal invasion of the mass. After 4 weeks of crizotinib treatment, a major response was achieved and the tumor became completely cavitary. Short-term neoadjuvant therapy with crizotinib for 4 weeks might be a promising therapy in locally advanced ALK-positive NSCLC and might provide a chance for resectability.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Apr 24.,"Clinical features and therapeutic options in non-small cell lung cancer patients  with concomitant mutations of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS or BRAF.","BACKGROUND: Although oncogenic driver mutations were thought to be mutually exclusive in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), certain tumors harbor co-occurring mutations and represent a rare molecular subtype. The evaluation of  the clinical features and therapeutic response associated with this NSCLC subtype will be vital for understanding the heterogeneity of treatment response and improving the management of these patients. METHODS: This retrospective study included 3774 samples from patients diagnosed with NSCLC. All samples were screened for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, and BRAF mutation using the amplification-refractory mutation system. The relationship between concomitant driver mutations and clinicopathologic characteristics, and patient clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty-three (1.7%) samples had more than one driver gene mutation. Among these, 43 were coalterations with an EGFR mutation, 20 with an ALK rearrangement, and eight with an ROS1 rearrangement. Except for ROS1 concomitant mutations that  were more frequent in male patients (87.5%, P = 0.020), the clinicopathological features of the concomitant mutation patients were not significantly different from those harboring a single EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 mutation. Furthermore, first-line EGFR-TKI treatment did not significantly improve the progression-free  survival (PFS) of patients harboring EGFR concomitant mutation, compared to patients harboring a single EGFR mutation. However, for EGFR concomitant mutation patients, TKI therapy was more effective than chemotherapy (median PFS of 10.8 vs 5.2 months, P = 0.023). Lastly, KRAS mutations did not influence the EGFR-TKI therapy treatment effect. CONCLUSION: In this study, concomitant mutations were found in 1.7% of the NSCLC. EGFR-TKI therapy was more effective than chemotherapy for patients harboring EGFR concomitant mutation, and ROS1 concomitant mutations were more frequent in male patients. For patients harboring coalterations with an ALK or ROS1 rearrangement, we should be cautious when considering the therapeutic options.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Apr 16.,The clinical characteristic and prognostic factors of leptomeningeal metastasis in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer-a retrospective study from one single cancer institute.,"BACKGROUND: Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is a detrimental complication of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the optimal therapeutic approach for LM patients is in shortage. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical features and prognostic factors of NSCLC patients with LM. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of NSCLC patients with LM at the Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute between July 2014 and March 2018. Identified cases had pathology-proven NSCLC with either positive cerebrospinal fluid cytology or leptomeningeal enhancement by MRI. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six NSCLC patients (58 men, 78 women) with LM were enrolled in the retrospective study; median age was 55 years (range, 29-89 years). Fifty-one patients harbored EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangement was detected in 6 patients. Treatment for LM consisted of EGFR-TKIs alone in 11 patients, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) alone in 19 patients, Chemotherapy (ChT) alone in 12 patients, EGFR-TKIs plus WBRT in 30 patients, WBRT plus ChT in  25 patients, and EGFR-TKIs plus ChT in 24 patients. The median progression-free survival was 3.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.178-4.622), and the median overall survival (OSLM ) was 9.8 months (95% CI:7.5-12.1). Thirty patients who received WBRT plus EGFR-TKIs achieved longer survival than those who only received WBRT (median 13.6 vs 8.8 months; P = 0.027), but did not add any survival benefit than those only received EGFR-TKIs (median 13.6 vs 13.9 months;  P = 0.352). A multivariate analysis indicated that KPS ≥ 80 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.592, 95% CI:0.369-0.95; P = 0.03) and EGFR-TKIs (HR = 0.507, 95% CI:0.283-0.908; P = 0.022) after LM diagnosis were independent favourable predictors of survival, whereas smoking (HR = 1.181, 95% CI:1.009-3.246; P = 0.047) was an independent predictor of poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that patients with good performance statuses, non-smoking patients, and the administration of EGFR-TKIs might improve clinical  outcomes in NSCLC patients with LM.",ALK,1

A cohort of 785 Chinese patients with NSCLC who underwent resection from March 2016 to November 2017 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University was investigated. The specimens were subjected to hybridization capture and sequence of 8 important NSCLC-related driver genes. In addition, the  slides were tested for PD-L1, excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), ribonucleotide reductase subunit M1 (RRM1), thymidylate synthase (TS) and β-tubulin III by immunohistochemical staining. A total of 498 (63.4%) patients had at least 1 driver gene alteration. Wild-type, EGFR rare mutation (mut), ALK fusion (fus), RAS mut, RET fus and MET mut had relatively higher proportions of lower ERCC1 expression. EGFR 19del, EGFR L858R, EGFR rare mut, ALK fus, HER2 mut, ROS1 fus and MET mut were more likely to have TS low expression. Wild-type, EGFR L858R, EGFR rare mut and BRAF mut were associated with lower β-tubulin III expression. In addition, wild-type, RAS mut, ROS1 fus, BRAF and MET mut had higher proportion of PD-L1 high expression. As a pilot validation, 21 wild-type patients with advanced NSCLC showed better depth of response and response rate to taxanes compared with pemetrexed/gemcitabine (31.2%/60.0% vs 26.6%/45.5%).

The recent association of four oncogenic driver genes, ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1, as lung tumor predictive biomarkers has increased the need for precision medicine. We used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of non-small cell lung cancer from 150 EGFR mutation-negative cases and 10 fusion status-known cases and compared the performance of the Oncomine Dx Fusion Transcript Test (ODxFT) with FISH break-apart for the detection of ALK, RET, and ROS1 fusion genes. RNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue samples with or without macrodissection under hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the ALK fusion  gene was independently determined using these assays. Fusion detection analyses were successfully carried out using ODxFT in 150 cases, with only one invalid case. ALK fusion genes were detected at a frequency of 7.3% (11/150) in the lung  cancer specimens. Concordance rate between the ODxFT and ALK-FISH analyses was 99.3% (148/149). Sensitivity and specificity were 91.7% and 99.3%, respectively.  All the samples with a known fusion status were accurately matched between the two assays. Our results show a high concordance rate between the ODxFT and ALK-FISH analyses. ODxFT was thus validated as an effective method for detecting  clinically significant ALK fusion genes in paraffin-embedded tissue samples.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Apr 20.,NK92-CD16 cells are cytotoxic to non-small cell lung cancer cell lines that have acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved the outcomes for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring targetable driver mutations. However, acquired resistance to TKIs invariably develops within approximately 1 year of treatment by various mechanisms, including gatekeeper mutations, alternative pathway activation and histological transformations. Because immunotherapy is an option for patients with drug-resistant cancers, we generated several TKI-resistant NSCLC cell lines in vitro, and then evaluated the cytotoxicity of NK92-CD16 cells to these resistant  cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TKI-resistant NSCLC cells (H3122CR1, H3122LR1, H3122CR1LR1, PC-9GR, PC-9ER, EBC-CR1 and EBC-CR2) were established from NCI-H3122 (EML4-ALK fusion), PC-9 (EGFR exon19 deletion) and EBC-1 (MET amplification) after continuous exposure to crizotinib, ceritinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and capmatinib. Expression of ligands for natural killer (NK) cell receptors and total EGFR were analyzed using flow cytometry. NK cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) using anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) cetuximab were measured using NK92-CD16 as effectors and detected  using the 51Chromium-release assay. RESULTS: We found that NK92-CD16 cells preferentially killed TKI-resistant NSCLC  cells when compared with their parental NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was up-regulated in the TKI-resistant  NSCLC cells and patients' tumors, and the ICAM-1 up-regulated cancer cells lines  were less susceptible to NK cytotoxicity by blocking ICAM-1. Moreover, NK92-CD16  cell-induced cytotoxicity toward TKI-resistant NSCLC cells was enhanced in the presence of cetuximab, an EGFR-targeting mAb. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that combinational treatment with NK cell-based immunotherapy and cetuximab may be promising for patients with TKI-resistant NSCLC.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print], Feasibility of liquid biopsy using plasma and platelets for detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements in non-small cell lung cancer.,"PURPOSE: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using tumor tissue is the gold standard for detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, this method often is not repeatable  due to difficulties in the acquisition of tumor tissues. Blood-based liquid biopsy using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is expected to be useful to overcome this limitation. Here, we investigated the feasibility of liquid biopsy using plasma and platelets for detection of ALK rearrangement and prediction of ALK inhibitor treatment outcomes. METHODS: ALK-FISH assays were performed in 1128 tumor specimens of NSCLC between  January 2015 and June 2018. We retrospectively analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from previously confirmed FISH-positive (n = 199) and -negative (n = 920) cases. We recruited patients who had available  tissue specimens and agreed to venous sampling. RNA was extracted from FFPE blocks, plasma, and platelets. Fusion RNA of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK was detected by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Thirty-three FISH-positive and 28 FISH-negative patients were enrolled.  In validation, data compared with FISH, RT-PCR using FFPE tissues showed 54.5% sensitivity, 78.6% specificity, and 75.5% accuracy. Liquid biopsy had higher sensitivity (78.8%), specificity (89.3%) and accuracy (83.6%). Higher positivity  for liquid biopsy was shown in subgroups with delayed (≥ 6 months from diagnosis) blood sampling (plasma, 85.7%; platelets, 87.0%). In 26 patients treated with crizotinib, the platelet-positive subgroup showed longer median duration of treatment (7.2 versus 1.5 months), longer median progression-free survival (5.7 months versus 1.7 months), a higher overall response rate (70.6% versus 11.1%), and a higher disease control rate (88.2% versus 44.4%) than the platelet-negative subgroup. CONCLUSION: Liquid biopsy could have applications in the diagnosis of ALK-positive NSCLC, even when using RT-PCR, and platelets can be useful for predicting treatment outcomes of ALK inhibitors.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Mar 25., Comprehensive analysis of the characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with anti-PD-1 therapy in real-world practice.,"PURPOSE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown marked responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in clinical trials. However, because such trials comprise cohorts selected based on specific criteria, it is unclear if their results represent routine clinical practice. METHODS: We examined 155 patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea between March 2014 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, EGFR/ALK mutation status, metastatic locations, response to ICIs, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years and 72.9% of patients were male; former or current smokers constituted 67.1% of the subjects. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (67.7%), and 50.3% of the patients underwent ≥ 2 previous treatments. Twenty-three patients (14.8%) were EGFR mutation- or ALK rearrangement-positive.  The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.4-31.4%]; the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.06 (95% CI 1.893-4.21) and 10.25 (95% CI 5.39-15.11) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG performance status, EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement status, liver metastasis and PD-L1 proportion as independent predictors of OS. Furthermore, 61.9% of the patients had adverse events of any grade; 38.1% had immune-related adverse events that were associated with PFS and  OS on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world ORR, PFS, OS, and adverse event profiles were comparable to previous clinical trials despite the patients' different baseline characteristics.

Molecular determinants of response to lorlatinib have not been established, but preclinical data suggest that ALK resistance mutations may represent a biomarker of response in previously treated  patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline plasma and tumor tissue samples were collected from 198 patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer from the registrational phase II study of lorlatinib. We analyzed plasma DNA for ALK mutations using Guardant360. Tumor tissue DNA was analyzed using an ALK mutation-focused next-generation sequencing assay. Objective response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival were evaluated according to ALK mutation status. RESULTS: Approximately one quarter of patients had ALK mutations detected by plasma or tissue genotyping. In patients with crizotinib-resistant disease, the efficacy of lorlatinib was comparable among patients with and without ALK mutations using plasma or tissue genotyping. In contrast, in patients who had failed 1 or more second-generation ALK TKIs, objective response rate was higher among patients with ALK mutations (62% v 32% [plasma]; 69% v 27% [tissue]). Progression-free survival was similar in patients with and without ALK mutations  on the basis of plasma genotyping (median, 7.3 months v 5.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.81) but significantly longer in patients with ALK mutations identified by tissue genotyping (median, 11.0 months v 5.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.47). CONCLUSION: In patients who have failed 1 or more second-generation ALK TKIs, lorlatinib shows greater efficacy in patients with ALK mutations compared with patients without ALK mutations. Tumor genotyping for ALK mutations after failure  of a second-generation TKI may identify patients who are more likely to derive clinical benefit from lorlatinib.",ALK,1

We sought to identify prognostic factors of both intracranial progression (IC-PFS) and overall survival (OS) in a surgical cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1015 patients treated surgically for BM at Brigham and Women's Hospital (2007-2017). Kaplan-Meier curves were used for OS and IC-PFS and Cox proportional hazards models were built to assess for predictive factors. RESULTS: Common origins were lung (43.9%), breast (14.4%), and melanoma (13.8%).  Median OS for the cohort was 15.4 months (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 14.1-17.1). Breast cancer (22.1 months, 95%CI 17.8-30.3) and colorectal cancer (10.6 months, 95%CI 7.2-15.4) had the longest and shortest OS, respectively. On multivariable Cox regression, significant prognostic factors of shorter OS were age (HR 1.01, 95%CI 1.01-1.02), number of lesions (HR 1.56, 95%CI 1.28-1.89), extracranial spread at BM diagnosis (HR 1.26, 95%CI 1.05-1.52), and KPS (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.98-0.99). Regarding molecular factors, all driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma had a favorable effect (EGFR, HR 0.53, 95%CI 0.31-0.89; ALK, HR 0.28, 95%CI 0.12-0.66; KRAS, HR 0.65, 95%CI 0.47-0.92), triple negative status predicted poor prognosis in breast adenocarcinoma (HR 2.04, 95%CI 1.13-3.69), while no effect of BRAF/NRAS mutations was demonstrated in melanoma BMs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results corroborate the role of tumor origin and systemic as well as intracranial spread in OS. Heterogeneity within histologies was further explained by molecular alterations.",ALK,1

METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE search up to 1/30/18 using the keywords, alectinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, brigatinib, and lung cancer, resulting in a total  of 20 eligible cohorts with 2261 patients treated with ALK inhibitor monotherapy  for advanced NSCLC. The pooled incidences of all-grade, high-grade, and grade 5 pneumonitis were calculated. Subgroup analyses were conducted with meta-regression using study-level covariates. RESULTS: The overall pooled incidence of pneumonitis was 2.14% (95% CI: 1.37-3.34) for all grade, 1.33% (95% CI: 0.80-2.21) for high grade, and 0.22% (95% CI: 0.09-0.52) for grade 5 pneumonitis. The incidence was significantly higher in studies from Japan compared to studies of non-Japan origin, for all-grade (6.25% vs 1.14%, p < 0.001) and high-grade pneumonitis (3.31% vs 0.39%, p < 0.001). Multivariate meta-regression demonstrated the cohorts from Japanese studies had significantly higher odds of pneumonitis for all-grade (odds ratio [OR]: 4.329 [95% CI: 1.918, 9.770], p < 0.001) compared to those of non-Japan origin, after adjusting for types of ALK inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of ALK inhibitor pneumonitis was 2.14% in patients with advanced NSCLS. The patients from Japanese cohorts had a higher incidence of ALK-inhibitor pneumonitis, which indicates the need for increased awareness and caution for pneumonitis in Japanese patients treated with ALK inhibitors",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Apr 3.,The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer harboring driver mutations.,"The present retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of immune  checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring driver mutations. Patients with NSCLC harboring driver mutations who received ICIs (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) were reviewed in Hirosaki University and Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital. There were 139 patients who received molecular targeted drugs, including 24 patients treated with ICIs. Patient characteristics were as follows: Male/female, 5/19; median age 68 (range 39-82); smoking/non-smoking, 6/18; PS 0-1/2, 20/4; driver mutation status, EGFR/ALK/RET/ROS1: 21/1/1/1. The overall response rate was 16.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.0-37.1%] and the disease control rate was 33.4% (95%  CI, 18.9-55.1%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 62 days (95% CI 52-81 days). In the patients who had been treated by the preceding tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for >1 year, the PFS time was 110 days. On the other hand, in the patients who had received a TKI for less than a year, the PFS time was 56  days, which was significantly shorter (P=0.012). To conclude, some of the patients with NSCLC harboring driver mutation could benefit from ICIs, and the duration of previous TKI treatment may be associated with the efficacy.",ALK,1

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore the status of ALK in non-small-cell lung  cancer (NSCLC) specimens, to explore the relationships between ALK status and clinicopathological features and to identify genomic rearrangements via capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). METHODS: We tested 9889 NSCLC specimens for ALK status using the Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) antibody. Clinicopathological features were analyzed and genomic rearrangements identified using capture-based NGS in 76 ALK-positive cases. RESULTS: In total, 485 specimens (4.90%) tested positive for ALK. The positivity  rate was higher for adenocarcinoma samples than for non-adenocarcinoma samples (6.03 vs. 1.47%; p < 0.001) and for biopsies/cell blocks than for surgical specimens (7.00 vs. 4.16%; p < 0.001). Patient age, patient sex, specimen type, specimen histotype, and patient smoking history were all significantly correlated with ALK status. Genomic rearrangements were detected in 98.68% (75/76) of the ALK-positive samples; 89.33% (67/75) carried the canonical EML4-ALK, and the remaining samples carried only noncanonical ALK rearrangements. Four of these noncanonical ALK fusion samples were identified as carrying EML4-ALK transcripts  at the RNA level. A novel fusion variant, SRD5A2-ALK, was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients with NSCLC, especially those aged < 30 years, were  more likely to test positive for ALK. Positive ALK test results were more common  in patients with invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and solid-predominant invasive  adenocarcinoma than in patients with other histotypes. Samples that carried only  noncanonical ALK rearrangements may also have carried the canonical EML4-ALK, which was not detected by capture-based NGS. EML4-ALK transcripts might result from rare splicing mechanisms without genomic rearrangements.",ALK,1

Real-world research data are needed as further evidence. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study to explore how crizotinib affects the control of brain metastasis and the survival outcomes among Chinese patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of unselected ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib at five hospitals in China  from January 1, 2013 to November 30, 2017. Patients developing brain metastasis either before or during crizotinib treatment were included. Survival outcomes were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients were included in the analysis; 95 of these patients had baseline brain metastasis, while 79 patients developed brain metastasis during crizotinib treatment. Among patients with baseline brain metastasis, the median intracranial time to progression was 19.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.5-26.2) and the median overall survival (OS) was 53.4 months (95% CI not reached). A total of 135 patients experienced intracranial progression, and 94 of these patients continued crizotinib beyond progressive disease (CBPD). There was no significant difference in the median OS  between patients with CBPD and without CBPD (48.3 months vs 53.4 months; p = 0.296). CONCLUSIONS: ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC patients with baseline brain metastasis can still achieve OS benefits from crizotinib treatment. However, patients with intracranial progression may not obtain a long-term survival benefit from continuation of CBPD.",ALK,1

Crizotinib, an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), MET, and ROS1, has shown marked antitumor activity in patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to analyze the efficacy and safety of crizotinib treatment in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement in real-world clinical practice. METHODS: We included 35 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC in this retrospective analysis. All received crizotinib 250 mg twice daily between March 2016 and April 2018 at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. All had histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangements, which were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or next-generation sequencing. The main outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival  (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 51.0 years; 23 (65.7%) were female and 28 (80.0%) were never smokers. All were diagnosed as having adenocarcinoma; eight patients (22.9%) had brain metastases at baseline. The ORR and DCR were 71.4% and 94.3%, respectively. The estimated median PFS was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.8-14.2). The estimated median OS was 41.0 months (95%  CI 22.5-59.5). Elevated transaminases (54.3%), vision disorder (25.7%), elevated  blood creatinine (22.9%), diarrhea (20.0%), and vomiting (20.0%) were the most commonly reported adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Crizotinib was effective and well tolerated in Chinese patients with  ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC in real-world clinical practice. The progression sites and patterns, as well as treatments after first disease progression on crizotinib were diverse. Crizotinib beyond progressive disease and local therapy  after failure of crizotinib treatment were feasible and effective in clinical practice.",ALK,1

Although TC2N has proven to be an oncogene in lung cancer, its biological function and molecular mechanisms in other cancer still remains unclear. Here, we investigate in breast cancer that TC2N expression is sharply overexpressed in breast cancer specimens compared with normal breast specimens, and the low TC2N expression was associated with advanced stage, lymphatic metastasis, larger tumors and shorter survival time. Upregulation of TC2N significantly restrains breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, TC2N blocks AKT signaling in a PI3K dependent and independent way through weakening the interaction between ALK and p55γ or inhibiting the binding of EBP1 and AKT. To sum up, these results unmask an ambivalent role of TC2N in cancer, providing a promising inhibitor for PI3K-AKT signaling.",ALK,1

Furthermore, biomarkers identified from gene analysis can be used to detect early lung cancer, determine patient prognosis, and monitor response to therapy. In the present study we analyzed the molecular profile of seventy-three Tunisian patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). Mutational analyses for EGFR and KRAS were performed using direct sequencing, immunohistochemistry or MassARRAY. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the D5F3 clone, and p53 expression was also assessed. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 61 years (range 23-82 years). Using different methodologies, EGFR mutations were found in 5.47% of patients and only exon 19 deletions E746-A750 del were detected. KRAS mutations were present in 9.58% of cases, while only one patient was ALK-positive. Moreover, abnormal immunostaining of p53 was detected in 56.16% of patients. In conclusion, the detected rates of EGFR and KRAS mutation and ALK rearrangement were lower than those found in European and Asian  countries, whereas, abnormal p53 expression was slightly more frequent. Furthermore, given the small sample size of this study, a more comprehensive analysis of this patient set is warranted.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print], Amplifying Outcomes: Checkpoint Inhibitor Combinations in First-Line Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, resulting in approximately 1.8 million deaths worldwide. Immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors has become standard of care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and there is increasing interest in further improving outcomes through combination with other therapeutics. This systematic review evaluates emerging phase III data on the efficacy and safety of checkpoint inhibitor combinations as first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published and presented literature was searched using the  key search terms non-small cell lung cancer AND checkpoint-inhibitors (OR respective aliases) AND phase III trials. Seven randomized phase III clinical trials reporting outcomes on checkpoint inhibitor combinations in first-line advanced NSCLC were identified. RESULTS: Four first-line trials reported outcomes for checkpoint inhibitor combinations in nonsquamous NSCLC. Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy, atezolizumab-chemotherapy, and atezolizumab-bevacizumab-chemotherapy showed significantly improved overall survival compared with controls in patients with advanced nonsquamous epidermal growth factor receptor-negative (EGFR-)/ anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK)- NSCLC. Two trials reported outcomes for squamous NSCLC, with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy reporting significantly improved  overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy. The combination of nivolumab-ipilimumab in all-comer histology failed to improve OS compared with histology appropriate chemotherapy in patients regardless of their tumor mutational burden status. Based on improved survival and safety, either pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab-chemotherapy administered based on PD-L1 status and histology is a preferred treatment option. Outcomes for atezolizumab-bevacizumab-chemotherapy in EGFR+/ALK+ patients are promising and require further exploration. CONCLUSION: First-line checkpoint inhibitors added to standard therapies improve  overall survival for nonsquamous EGFR-/ALK- and squamous advanced NSCLC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors are now standard of care for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and emerging data show that combining these agents with established chemotherapy further improves outcomes. The phase III KEYNOTE-189 and IMPower-130 trials showed significantly improved survival using this strategy for nonsquamous NSCLC, and the phase III KEYNOTE-407 trial showed similar results in squamous disease. Checkpoint inhibitor combinations are therefore an important new treatment option for first-line NSCLC. Programmed death ligand-1 expression may inform the use of  checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy, and overall tumor mutation burden is also an emerging biomarker for this new treatment strategy.",ALK,1

The patient developed follicular lymphoma during treatment with the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor afatinib. Standard immunochemotherapy for follicular lymphoma was introduced in addition to continuing treatment with afatinib for lung cancer. Immunochemotherapy was effective and improved the patient's performance status while afatinib controlled the progression of lung cancer. Our case study suggests that it is safe to introduce standard immunochemotherapy for patients who develop malignant lymphoma while continuing treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for lung adenocarcinoma expressing mutant EGFR.,ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print], Immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with advanced lung cancer and oncogenic driver alterations: results from the IMMUNOTARGET registry.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-PD1/PD-L1 directed immune-checkpoint-inhibitors (ICI) are widely used to treat patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The activity of ICI across NSCLC harboring oncogenic alterations is poorly characterized. The aim of our study was to address the efficacy of ICI in the context of oncogenic addiction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study for patients receiving ICI monotherapy for advanced NSCLC with at least one oncogenic driver alteration. Anonymized data were evaluated for clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes for ICI therapy: best response (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and  overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was PFS under ICI. Secondary endpoints were best response (RECIST 1.1) and overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. RESULTS: We studied 551 patients treated in 24 centers from 10 countries. The molecular alterations involved KRAS (n = 271), EGFR (n = 125), BRAF (n = 43), MET (n = 36), HER2 (n = 29), ALK (n = 23), RET (n = 16), ROS1 (n = 7), and multiple drivers (n = 1). Median age was 60 years, gender-ratio was 1:1, never/former/current smokers were 28/51/21% respectively, and the majority of tumors were adenocarcinoma. The objective response rate by driver alteration was: KRAS=26%, BRAF=24%, ROS1=17%, MET=16%, EGFR=12%, HER2=7%, RET=6%, ALK=0%. In the  entire cohort, median PFS was 2.8 months, OS 13.3 months and the best response rate 19%. In a subgroup analysis, median PFS (in months) was 2.1 for EGFR, 3.2 for KRAS, 2.5 for ALK, 3.1 for BRAF, 2.5 for HER2, 2.1 for RET, and 3.4 for MET.  In certain subgroups, PFS was positively associated with PD-L1 expression (KRAS,  EGFR) and with smoking status (BRAF, HER2). CONCLUSIONS: ICI induced regression in some tumors with actionable driver alterations, but clinical activity was lower compared to the KRAS group and the lack of response in the ALK group was notable. Patients with actionable tumor alterations should receive targeted therapies and chemotherapy before considering immunotherapy.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print], Entrectinib resistance mechanisms in ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.,"Entrectinib is a pan-tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that targets oncogenic rearrangements in NTRK, ROS1 and ALK. The combined results of two clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of entrectinib in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. Because the development of drug resistance is inevitable, it would be helpful to determine the mechanisms of entrectinib resistance in a ROS1-rearranged tumor model so that future therapeutic strategies can be developed. Here, we characterized the molecular basis of resistance in entrectinib-resistant ROS1-rearranged HCC78 cells (HCC78ER cells). These cells were analyzed by next-generation sequencing and genetic profiling, which revealed the acquisition of KRAS G12C and the amplification of KRAS and FGF3. However, there were no secondary mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain. We also found that sustained ERK activation was involved in entrectinib resistance, and that combined treatment with selumetinib resensitized HCC78ER cells to entrectinib in cell viability and colony formation assays. Our data suggest that activation of the RAS signaling pathway can cause entrectinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, and is unlikely to be overcome by sequential single agent ROS1-targeting strategies against such tumors. Instead, co-targeting ROS1 and MEK may be an effective strategy for overcoming entrectinib resistance in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.",ALK,1

Alterations of these two genes were traditionally considered to be mutually exclusive, but recent studies have suggested that they  can occur concomitantly. Here, we investigated the prevalence, clinical features  and outcomes in response to the treatment of NSCLC patients who harbor EGFR and ALK co-alterations. Methods: We reviewed the genomic profiles of 419 ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients with the intent of investigating the EGFR kinase domain (exon 18-21) and ALK co-alterations. The genomes of these patients were sequenced in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory. Results: The overall frequency of concomitant EGFR (exon 18-21) and ALK alterations was 5.01% (21/419) in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. The concomitant  rate of EGFR alterations in patients with EML4-ALK co-alterations (3.06%, 11/359) was dramatically lower than that in patients with non-EML4-ALK co-alterations (16.67%, 10/60, p<0.01). EML4-ALK/EGF R co-alterations were more prone to occur in females than in males, and non-EML4-ALK/EGFR co-alterations were more common in males than in females (p=0.02). Before the detection of EGFR-ALK co-alterations, some patients were treated with EGFR-TKIs (n=16) according to previously detected EGFR alterations; Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that EML4-ALK/EGFR co-altered patients (n=7) had a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) after EGFR-TKI treatment than that of non-EML4-ALK/EGFR co-altered patients (n=8; mPFS, 6.0 vs 15.0 months, p=0.046). In addition, we demonstrated the subsequent clinical outcomes of co-altered patients after previous EGFR-TKI treatment. Five EGFR/ALK co-altered patients treated with single TKIs (EGFR-TKIs or ALK-TKIs) displayed diverse clinical outcomes. Three patients who received dual-TKI treatment (EGFR-TKI plus ALK-TKI)  all achieved a PFS of more than 5 months (8.4 months, 8.6 months, >5.2 months). Conclusion: EML4-ALK/EGFR and non-EML4-ALK/EGFR co-alterations displayed distinct clinical features and responses to EGFR-TKIs, suggesting that non-EML4-ALK co-alterations are likely to occur as a resistance mechanism to EGFR-TKI. In addition, dual-TKI therapy might be a better choice than single-TKI treatments for these co-altered patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest  dual-positive EGFR/ALK cohort study in People's Republic of China.",ALK,1

Relative risk (95% CI) of developing grade 3-4 neutropenia with ALK inhibitor versus chemotherapy was 0.27 (0.07-1.06). Probabilities of developing grade 3-4 neutropenia were 6.56 and 14.19%, respectively; no significant difference was found. Conclusion: In patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia with ALK-targeted therapy is not significantly different compared with chemotherapy.",ALK,1

Involvement of mutated Anaplasic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)positive fusion protein in progression of NSCLC has made itself a propitious target to inhibit and treat NSCLC. In present study, the main motive is to screen the most effective inhibitor against ALK protein with potential pharmacological profile. METHODS: The selected ligands were docked with Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD). With reference to the obtained compound with highest score, PubChem database was virtually screened to retrieve a large set of similar compounds which were docked to find the compound with higher affinity. Further comparative studies and In silico prediction included Pharmacophore studies, proximity energy parameters, ADMET and BOILED-egg plot analysis. RESULTS: CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) was best docked pre-established compound with preferable pharmacological profile and PubChem compound CID-123449015 came out as the most efficient virtually screened inhibitor. Interestingly, the contours of the virtual screened compound PubChem CID- 123449015 fall within our desire high volume cavity of protein having admirable property to control the ALK regulation to prevent carcinogenesis in NSCLC. BOILED-Egg plot analysis depicts that both the compounds have analogous characteristics in the divergent aspects. Moreover, in the evaluations of Blood Brain Barrier, Human Intestinal Absorption, AMES toxicity, and LD50 the virtual screened compound (PubChem CID- 123449015)was found within high optimization. CONCLUSION: These investigations denotes that virtual screened compound (PubChem  CID- 123449015) is more efficient to be a better prospective candidate for NSCLC  treatment having good pharmacological profile than the pre-established compound CEP-37440 (PubChem CID- 71721648) with low rerank score. The identified virtual screened drug have a high potential to act as ALK inhibitors and can show promising results in the research of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",ALK,1

INTRODUCTION: Several studies have suggested that non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement might  have different imaging features compared with those without the rearrangement. The goal of this work was to systematically investigate the computed tomography (CT) imaging features of ALK-rearranged NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched published studies that investigated CT imaging features of ALK-rearranged NSCLC compared with ALK-negative, including epidermal  growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant and ALK/EGFR-negative, NSCLC. We extracted clinicopathologic characteristics and CT imaging features of patients in the included studies. Features were compared and tested in the form of odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences at a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Twelve studies with 2210 patients with NSCLC were included. Compared with ALK-negative NSCLC, ALK-rearranged NSCLC was more likely to be solid (OR, 2.37; P < .001) and less likely to have cavitation (OR, 0.45; P = .002). In advanced stages, patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC, compared with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, were more likely to have lymphadenopathy (OR, 3.47; P < .001), pericardial metastasis (OR, 2.18; P = .04), pleural metastasis (OR, 2.07; P = .004), and lymphangitic carcinomatosis (OR, 3.41; P = .02), but less likely to have lung metastasis (OR, 0.52; P = .003). Compared with ALK/EGFR-negative NSCLC, ALK-rearranged NSCLC was more likely to have lymphangitic carcinomatosis (OR, 3.88; P = .03), pleural metastasis (OR, 1.89; P = .02), and pleural effusion (OR, 2.94; P = .003). CONCLUSION: ALK-rearranged NSCLC has imaging features that are different compared with EGFR-mutant and ALK/EGFR-negative NSCLC.

Here, we characterized the fusion gene, VAPA-Rab31, discovered from RNA-sequencing data of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who did not harbor activating mutations in EGFR, KRAS and ALK. This fusion gene encodes a protein comprising the N-terminal region of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) fused to the C-terminal region of Ras-related protein 31 (Rab31). Exogenous expression of  VAPA-Rab31 in immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated the potential transforming effects of this fusion gene, including increased colony formation and cell proliferation in vitro. Also, enhanced tumorigenicity upon VAPA-Rab31 was confirmed in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Metastatic tumors were also detected in the liver and lungs of xenografted mice. Overexpression of  VAPA-Rab31 upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and phosphorylated CREB both  in cells and xenograft tumors. Reduced apoptosis and increased phosphorylation of CREB and Erk were observed in VAPA-Rab31-overexpressing cells after bortezomib treatment. Elevated Bcl-2 level via activated CREB contributed to the resistance  to the bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest the oncogenic function of the novel fusion gene VAPA-Rab31 via upregulated Bcl-2 and activated CREB in lung cancer.",ALK,1

METHODS: Mutation of 13 genes including EGFR, ALK, KRAS were detected among 102 patients with NSCLCs by next-generation sequencing, and the correlation between mutations and clinical characteristics and response to targeted therapy was analyzed. RESULTS: In total 42 EGFR mutations (40.8%), 3 ALK fusions (3.9%), 6 KRAS mutations (5.8%), 3 PIK3CA mutations and amplifications (2.9%), 1 MET exon 14-skipping (1%) and 1 RET fusion (1%) were detected. The occurrence of mutations have varied with sample types and pathological types. Seventeen out of 20 EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-treated patients with EGFR mutations have shown remission. CONCLUSION: The mutational frequency of NSCLCs among Chinese patients slightly differed from the western populations, in particular the frequency of ALK fusion. The mutations have well correlated with clinical response to targeted therapy.",ALK,1

At present, three or more generations of ALK inhibitors have been used for ALK-positive NSCLC treatment, including crizotinib, alectinib, ceritinib, and brigatinib. Although most adverse events (AEs) of ALK inhibitors are grades 1 to 2 and generally can be well tolerated, serious adverse events (SAEs) of ALK inhibitors lack data analysis, and the lung  toxicity of ALK inhibitors needs attention. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to evaluate the safety of ALK inhibitors, especially in terms of drug-related SAEs. Methods: A total of 19 studies from 4 databases (PubMed, Science Direct, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Library) were included in this meta-analysis. All statistical analyses in this meta-analysis were performed with the STATA 14.0 software. We analyzed the incidences of total AEs, total SAEs and SAEs for different ALK inhibitors. Results: AEs of the ALK inhibitors occurred in almost all participants, and SAEs occurred in more than 20% of the participants. For ceritinib and brigatinib, SAEs occurred in more than 40% of the participants. Alectinib is most likely the safest of the two generations of ALK inhibitors. Generally, the ALK inhibitors showed significant lung toxicity. Conclusion: In conclusion, attention should be focused on ALK inhibitor-related SAEs, especially lung toxicity. According to this meta-analysis, alxectinib seems to be the safest ALK inhibitor. Physicians should focus on the related SAEs when prescribing ALK inhibitors.",ALK,1

First-line therapies for metastatic NSCLC such as crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), have developed resistance due to a rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. Brigatinib, approved  in May 2016, is an ALK inhibitor specifically indicated for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in patients who have progressed on or resistant to crizotinib therapy. In several clinical trials, brigatinib has exhibited significant improvement in progression-free survival in patients that have experienced resistance to crizotinib therapy. The optimal dose of brigatinib was found to be  180 mg once daily and demonstrated greater efficacy as compared to its 90 mg once daily dose. Brigatinib was also found to be well tolerated. Although more studies are needed, the current data from these studies indicate brigatinib may be the most favorable therapeutic approach to treat NSCLC ALK-positive patients",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Apr 4.," Pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for previously untreated, PD-L1-expressing, locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (KEYNOTE-042): a randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 3 trial.","Comment in     Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2019 Jul;16(7):403.  BACKGROUND: First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy improves overall and progression-free survival in patients with untreated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50% or greater. We investigated overall survival after treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without a sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 or 1, life expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. Randomisation was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of  world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (≥50% vs 1-49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every  3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0·0122, p=0·0120, and p=0·0124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the  previous findings were significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894. FINDINGS: From Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57-69]) with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of 20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up  was 12·8 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (≥50% hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI 0·56-0·85, p=0·0003; ≥20% 0·77, 0·64-0·92, p=0·0020, and ≥1% 0·81, 0·71-0·93, p=0·0018). The median surival values by TPS population were 20·0 months (95% CI 15·4-24·9) for pembrolizumab versus 12·2 months (10·4-14·2) for chemotherapy, 17·7 months (15·3-22·1) versus 13·0 months (11·6-15·3), and 16·7 months (13·9-19·7) versus 12·1 months (11·3-13·3), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of 636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.

Research is ongoing to expand the number of drug targets that can offer clinically meaningful outcomes.  Rearranged during transfection (RET) fusions are the latest oncogenic driver alterations that show potential as a drug target. RET fusions occur in 1-2% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. They are more commonly associated with  younger age, female gender, non-smokers and Asian ethnicity. The RET kinase is abnormally activated through fusion with a partner protein such as KIF5B, CCDC6 or NCOA4. This leads to downstream intracellular signalling and enhancement of gene transcription and cell proliferation. The effectiveness of multi-kinase inhibitors in RET positive NSCLC has been explored in early phase and retrospective studies. From these studies, the most effective agents identified include cabozantanib and vandetanib. Overall response rates (ORR) vary from 18-47% across studies. In general, these agents have a manageable toxicity profile, although there are a number of off-target toxicities. Similar to the increased activity in ALK rearranged disease, pemetrexed has demonstrated superior response rates in this patient group and should be considered. Selective RET inhibitors, including LOXO-292 and BLU-667, are progressing in clinical trials. LOXO-292 has demonstrated an impressive ORR of 77% in RET positive solid  tumours. It is anticipated this agent will be an effective targeted therapeutic option for patients with RET positive lung cancer.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print], Indoor Radon in EGFR- and BRAF-Mutated and ALK-Rearranged Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Radon gas is the leading cause of lung cancer in the nonsmoking population. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends indoor concentrations  of < 100 Bq/m³. Several molecular alterations have been described in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mainly in nonsmokers, with no risk factors identified. We studied the role of indoor radon in NSCLC patients harboring specific driver alterations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the radon concentration from EGFR-, BRAF-mutated (m), and ALK-rearranged (r) NSCLC patients measured by an alpha-track detector placed in their homes between September 2014 and August 2015. Clinical characteristics were collected prospectively, and pathologic samples were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included (36 EGFRm, 10 ALKr, 2 BRAFm). Median  radon concentration was 104 Bq/m³ (IQR 69-160) overall, and was 96 Bq/m³ (42-915) for EGFRm, 116 (64-852) for ALKr, and 125 for BRAFm, with no significant differences. Twenty-seven patients (56%) had indoor radon above WHO recommendations, 8 (80%) of 10 ALKr, 2 (100%) of 2 BRAFm, and 17 (47%) of 36 EGFRm. CONCLUSION: The median indoor radon concentration was above the WHO recommendations, with no differences between EGFR, ALK, and BRAF patients. Concentrations above the WHO recommendations were most common with ALKr and BRAFm. These findings should be validated in larger studies.",ALK,1

While this is definitely a major therapeutic success for thoracic oncology, it may not be entirely attributable to rapid drug development and the strenuous clinical efforts. At the genetic level,  ALK+ disease is also unique, distinguished by the lowest tumor mutational burden  (mean below 3 mutations/Mbp), the lowest frequency of TP53 mutations (20-25%) and very few other co-mutations compared to other NSCLC. The relative simplicity and  stability of the genetic landscape not only contribute to the relatively favourable clinical course, but also make study of the effects from individual molecular features easier. EML4-ALK fusion variant 3 (E6;A20) and TP53 mutations  were recently identified as main molecular determinants of adverse outcome: they  occur in about 30-40% and 20-25% of newly-diagnosed cases, respectively, have possibly synergistic effects and are independently associated with more aggressive disease, shorter progression-free survival under treatment with ALK inhibitors and worse overall survival. Secondary detection of TP53 mutations at disease progression in previously negative patients defines another subset (about 20%) with similarly poor outcome, while detection of ALK resistance mutations guides next-line therapy. As our biological understanding deepens, additional molecular risk factors will be identified and refine our concepts further. The translation of clinical risk at the molecular level and the ability to predict early events are of key importance for individualized patient management and preclinical modeling in order to advance therapeutic options.",ALK,1

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the clinical outcomes and costs of alectinib and crizotinib, which included five health states: progression-free  (PF) without central nervous system (CNS) progression, PF with CNS progression, post-progression (PP) without CNS progression, PP with CNS progression, and death. Clinical data for transition probabilities were obtained from the ALEX trial at the updated data cutoff. Healthcare resource utilization and costs were  derived from clinical expert opinions and published literature. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the results. Scenario analyses were conducted including using clinical data from the ALESIA trial in Asian patients, using utilities from the ALEX trial, and choosing different parametric survival models. RESULTS: In base case analysis, alectinib yielded an additional 1.04 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with incremental costs of $54,827, resulting  in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $52,869/QALY. In scenario analysis, the ICER was $56,787/QALY using clinical data from the ALESIA trial. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probabilities of alectinib being cost-effective were 0.4% and 43.7% when the willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds were $28,109/QALY and $50,000/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSION: Alectinib could prolong the mean time of PF and delay the time to CNS progression. However, because of its high drug cost, alectinib was unlikely to be cost-effective for untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients in China.",ALK,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 18 randomized clinical trials of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC), initiated after 2007 and submitted to U.S. Food and Drug Administration. TTD was calculated as date of randomization to date of discontinuation or death and compared to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) across all patients, as well as in treatment-defined subgroups [EGFR mutation-positive treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), EGFR wild-type treated with TKI, ALK-positive treated with TKI, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), chemotherapy doublet with maintenance, chemotherapy monotherapy]. RESULTS: Overall across 8947 patients, TTD was more closely associated with PFS (r = 0.87, 95% CI 0.86-0.87) than with OS (0.68, 95% CI 0.67-0.69). Early TTD (PFS-TTD ≥ 3 months) occurred in 7.7% of patients overall, and was more common with chemo monotherapy (15.0%) while late TTD (TTD-PFS ≥ 3 months) occurred in 6.0% of patients overall, and was more common in EGFR-positive and ALK-positive patients (12.4% and 22.9%). In oncogene-targeted subgroups (EGFR positive and ALK positive), median TTDs (13.4 and 14.1 months) exceeded median PFS (11.4 and 11.3 months). CONCLUSIONS: At the patient level, TTD is associated with PFS across therapeutic  classes. Median TTD exceeds median PFS for biomarker-selected patients receiving  oncogene-targeted therapies. TTD should be prospectively studied further as an end point for pragmatic randomized RWE trials only for continuously administered  therapies.

Epub 2019 Apr 3.,Targeting anaplastic lymphoma kinase in neuroblastoma.,"Over the last decade, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), has been identified as a fusion partner in a diverse variety of translocation events resulting in oncogenic signaling in many different cancer types. In tumors where the full-length ALK RTK itself is mutated, such as neuroblastoma, the picture regarding the role of ALK as an oncogenic driver is less clear. Neuroblastoma is a complex and heterogeneous tumor that arises from the neural crest derived peripheral nervous system. Although high-risk neuroblastoma is rare, it often relapses and becomes refractory to treatment. Thus, neuroblastoma accounts for 10-15% of all childhood cancer deaths. Since most cases are in children under the age of 2, understanding the role and regulation of ALK during neural crest development is an important goal in addressing neuroblastoma tumorigenesis. An impressive array of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that act to inhibit ALK have been FDA approved for use in ALK-driven cancers. ALK TKIs bind differently within the ATP-binding pocket of the ALK kinase domain and have been associated with different resistance mutations within ALK itself that arise in response to therapeutic use, particularly in ALK-fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This patient population has highlighted the importance of considering the relevant ALK TKI to be used for a given ALK mutant variant. In this review, we discuss ALK in  neuroblastoma, as well as the use of ALK TKIs and other strategies to inhibit tumor growth. Current efforts combining novel approaches and increasing our understanding of the oncogenic role of ALK in neuroblastoma are aimed at improving the efficacy of ALK TKIs as precision medicine options in the clinic.",ALK,1

In  particular, robust IHC assays performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue are widely used as surrogate markers for ALK and ROS1 rearrangements and for detecting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in  patients with advanced NSCLC; in addition, they have become essential for treatment decisions. Cytology samples represent the only source of tumor in a significant proportion of patients with inoperable NSCLC, and there is increasing demand for predictive biomarker testing on them. However, the wide variation in the types of cytology samples and their preparatory methods, the use of alcohol-based fixatives that interfere with immunochemistry results, the difficulty in procurement of cytology-specific controls, and the uncertainty regarding test validity have resulted in underutilization of cytology material for predictive immunocytochemistry (ICC), and most cytopathologists limit such testing to FFPE cell blocks (CBs). The purpose of this review is to: 1) analyze various preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical factors influencing ICC results; 2) discuss measures for validation of ICC protocols; and 3) summarize published data on predictive ICC for ALK, ROS1, EGFR gene alterations and PD-L1 expression on lung cancer cytology. Based on our experience and from a review of  the literature, we conclude that cytology specimens are in principal suitable for predictive ICC, but proper optimization and rigorous quality control for high-quality staining are essential, particularly for non-CB preparations.",ALK,1

Furthermore, double immune checkpoint inhibition has shown promising results in treatment naïve patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB). Of note, the presence of both negative PD-L1 expression and low TMB may identify a subgroup of patients who has little benefit from immunotherapy combinations and for whom the best treatment option may still be platinum-based chemotherapy. To date, first-line single agent immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated limited activity in EGFR mutated NSCLC and the combination of immunotherapy and targeted agents has raised safety concerns in both EGFR and ALK positive NSCLC patients. Finally, in EGFR mutated or ALK rearranged NSCLC, atezolizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab is emerging as a potential treatment option upon progression to first line tyrosine  kinase inhibitors.",ALK,1

Indeed, treatment approaches for a  majority of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC are evolving rapidly.  Only for the small proportion of patients with metastatic NSCLC and genomic-driven tumors with EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-sensitizing mutations (5%-15%), and possibly BRAF mutations and ROS rearrangements, have initial treatment recommendations remained unchanged, with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors as the preferred therapy. For the remaining patients, an immunotherapy-based regimen alone or in combination with chemotherapy is now the  preferred option based on high-level evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials and in accordance with all available guidelines. Deciding between therapeutic options can be difficult due to the lack of direct cross-comparison studies, differences in chemotherapies and stratification factors, and differences in study populations resulting from inclusion criteria such as histology, PD-L1 expression, or tumor mutational burden (TMB).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study was a single-institution study conducted on patients with unresectable stage III non-squamous NSCLC treated by definitive chemoradiotherapy between January 2006 and March 2016. Only patients with information of EGFR mutations and/or ALK translocation were included. The prognosis and initial recurrence patterns were compared according to the presence/absence of EGFR mutation and/or ALK translocation. RESULTS: A total of 173 patients (34 with activating EGFR mutations, 13 who were  positive for ALK translocation) were enrolled, and the median follow-up duration  was 36 months (range, 3-123 months). The 3-year overall survival rate was significantly higher in the EGFR-mutant group than in the wild-type EGFR group (75% vs. 46%; P = .002). There was a tendency towards a better overall survival in the ALK-positive group than in the ALK-negative group (68% vs. 44%; P = .085). No differences in the 3-year progression-free survival were observed according to the EGFR or ALK status. The EGFR-mutant group showed a significantly lower rate of in-field failure (P = .027) and higher rate of out-of-field failure (P = .029) as compared with the wild-type EGFR group. There was no significant difference in the rate of in-field failure or out-of-field failure between the ALK-positive and ALK-negative groups.

The primary objective of this phase 1 study (NCT01553656) was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of cabozantinib in Japanese patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled at 2 sites in Japan. After determining the MTD and RP2D, an expansion in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consisting of 3 molecularly defined cohorts (EGFR mutation; KRAS mutation; ALK, RET, or ROS1 fusion) was initiated. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01553656). RESULTS: Forty-three Japanese patients were enrolled (dose escalation, n = 23; NSCLC expansion, n = 20). The MTD of cabozantinib capsules was 60 mg daily, and the RP2D of cabozantinib tablets was 60 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities were hypertension, proteinuria, and venous embolism. Safety and pharmacokinetics in Japanese patients were consistent with those in non-Japanese patients. Common adverse events included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, hypertension, and diarrhea. Reduction in tumor lesion size was observed in multiple tumor types in  the dose-escalation cohorts, with partial responses observed in 4 of 9 patients with NSCLC (EGFR mutation, n = 1; ALK fusion, n = 2; and RET fusion, n = 1). In the NSCLC expansion, 4 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC had partial responses; the remaining 16 (EGFR mutation, n = 11; KRAS mutation, n = 2; ALK fusion, n = 1; and RET fusion, n = 2) had stable disease as best response. CONCLUSION: Cabozantinib had a manageable safety profile in Japanese patients with solid tumors. Responses were observed in diverse molecular subtypes of NSCLC.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Dec 31.,Efficacy and Safety of Lorlatinib in Korean Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients  With ALK or ROS1 Rearrangement Whose Disease Failed to Respond to a Previous Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.,"INTRODUCTION: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring ALK or ROS1 rearrangements invariably acquire resistance to the first- and second-generation  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), most notably ALK G1202R and ROS1 G2032R. Lorlatinib, a novel third-generation TKI, produced remarkable results from the first-in-man phase 1 trial: an overall response rate of 46% and 50% for previously treated ALK- and ROS1-positive patients, respectively. However, the efficacy of lorlatinib has not been widely validated in Asian patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC with ALK or ROS1 rearrangements who initiated lorlatinib therapy between November 2016 and July 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Twelve consecutive patients were included. The median age was 55 years (range, 36-76 years). Ten (83%) had ALK-positive NSCLC and 2 (17%) had ROS1-positive NSCLC. All patients had a history of first- or second-generation ALK TKI receipt. Two ALK-positive patients and one ROS1-positive patient had the  G1202R and G2032R mutations, respectively. The overall response rate was 64% and  the disease control rate was 91%. Of the 3 ALK-positive patients with intracranial target lesions, 1 (33%) had a complete response and 2 (67%) a partial response, producing an intracranial objective response of 100%. The median progression-free survival was 6.5 months (range, 1.0-16.5 months). The most common adverse event was hypercholesterolemia (83%), and no adverse event-related dose reductions or treatment discontinuations were reported. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report that lorlatinib is an important novel therapeutic option for Asian patients who have advanced NSCLC harboring ALK/ROS1 mutations whose disease progressed during treatment with first- and second-generation TKIs.",ALK,1

In this review, we focus on the different aspects of the treatment of oncogene-driven NSCLC. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with an EGFR or ALK alteration show a better clinical outcome with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment compared to chemotherapy.Patients with a ROS1 rearrangement or a BRAF V600E mutation show favorable clinical outcome with TKI treatment compared to chemotherapy, although  randomized trials are not available.Patients on TKIs will eventually develop disease progression because of acquired resistance.The treatment with immunotherapy in EGFR and ALK-positive NSCLC patients did not improve overall survival over that of chemotherapy.Blood-based genetic analysis provides the opportunity to noninvasively screen patients for the presence of oncogenic drivers and to monitor resistance during TKI treatment. SUMMARY: Targeted molecular therapies are now standard of care for patients with  oncogene-driven NSCLC with a good clinical benefit and minimal toxicity. The role of immunotherapy in patients with molecular alterations is still unclear. Blood-based genotyping has gained interest in the diagnostic and resistance monitoring setting for patients with NSCLC.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Jan 4.,Qualitative and quantitative cytomorphological features of primary anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive (+) lung cancers are predictive for response to crizotinib and alectinib. There are many cases of lung cancer in which surgery cannot be performed, and such cases require diagnosis by  cytological specimen or biopsy. Estimating ALK (+) lung cancer from cytomorphology would allow molecular testing to proceed without the waste of a small amount of specimen. The purpose of this study was to assess whether qualitative and quantitative cytomorphological features are sufficient for distinguishing primary ALK (+) from ALK (-) lung cancer. METHODS: We examined eight qualitative cytomorphological parameters and three quantitative nuclear morphometric parameters in 17 cases of primary ALK (+) lung  cancer, diagnosed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using histological specimens, and in 41 cases of ALK (-) lung cancer. Quantitative nuclear morphometric parameters were analysed by a computer-assisted image analysis system. RESULTS: In ALK (+) lung cancer, three qualitative parameters (signet ring cells, nuclear grooves and single type nucleoli) and two quantitative parameters (large  nuclear area and irregular nuclear shape) were observed in significantly higher proportions. However, in ALK (-) lung cancer, one qualitative parameter (unclear  and multiple type nucleoli) was seen significantly more often. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the cytomorphological features of signet ring cells, nuclear grooves and nucleoli shape can help to triage a small amount  of cytological and biopsy specimens for appropriate molecular testing of primary  ALK (+) lung cancer.",ALK,1

The aim  of this prospective-retrospective cohort study was to obtain real-world data on the use of crizotinib or chemotherapy in patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in Russia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-negative metastatic NSCLC were screened in 23 cancer centers. To be eligible, patients were required to have confirmation of ALK rearrangement. Patients were treated with crizotinib (250 mg twice daily; n = 96) or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 53). The primary end point was OS. RESULTS: A total of 149 ALK-positive patients were included. Mean age was 53 years in both groups. Patients were predominately women (59%) and never-smokers (74%), and most patients had adenocarcinoma histology (95%). At a median follow-up time of 15 months, 79 of the 149 patients included in the analysis had  died. Median OS from the start of treatment was 31 months (95% CI, 28.5 to 33.5 months) in the crizotinib group and 15.0 months (95% CI, 9.0 to 21.0 months) in the chemotherapy group (P < .001). The objective response rate was 34% in the crizotinib group. Among patients with brain metastasis, one complete response (6%) and five partial responses (31%) were achieved. Grade 3 adverse events were  observed in three patients (3%) in the crizotinib group. CONCLUSION: The improved OS observed in crizotinib clinical trials in ALK-positive NSCLC was also observed in the less selective patient populations treated in daily practice in Russia. The use of standard chemotherapy in these patients remains common but seems inappropriate as a result of the effectiveness  of newer treatments, such as crizotinib.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Mar 1., The impact of copay assistance on patient out-of-pocket costs and treatment rates with ALK inhibitors.,"INTRODUCTION: The patient cost burden of oral anticancer medicines has been associated with prescription abandonment, delayed treatment initiation, and poorer health outcomes in the US. Since 2011, several small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. The objective of this study was to measure the impact of copay assistance on patient cost sharing and treatment patterns in patients prescribed  oral ALK inhibitors (ALKi's). METHODS: Patterns of claims approval/rejection and payment/reversal, out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, and treatment persistence were reported for patients identified in the IQVIA Formulary Impact Analyzer database from January 2013 to August 2017 linked to a medical claims database. The primary study cohorts were patients with copay assistance, including manufacturer's copay cards, other discount cards, or free-trial vouchers, on the index ALKi claim, and patients without copay assistance at any time during the follow-up period. RESULTS: In total, 3,143 patients were included in analyses related to claim patterns, and 1,685 patients were included in analyses related to treatment persistence. Copay assistance decreased the OOP cost for the first approved ALKi  by $1,930, on average. Patients with copay assistance picked up ALKi prescriptions from the pharmacy sooner than patients without copay assistance (2.6 days vs 25.7 days). In adjusted analyses, patients with copay assistance had 88.2% lower risk of abandoning their first approved prescription and 24.3% lower  risk of discontinuing treatment with the first observed ALKi (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Copay assistance reduced the patient cost burden for ALKi's and was associated with patients picking up their ALKi prescriptions, beginning ALKi treatment sooner, and remaining on treatment.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Jan 17.,Clinical Utility of Cerebrospinal Fluid Cell-Free DNA as Liquid Biopsy for Leptomeningeal Metastases in ALK-Rearranged NSCLC.,"INTRODUCTION: Leptomeningeal metastases (LMs) indicated a poor prognosis in NSCLC. LMs were more frequent in driver gene-mutated patients, and cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF) cell-free DNA has shown unique genetic profiles of LM in EGFR-mutated LM. However, studies in patients with ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK)-rearranged NSCLC with LMs are scarce. METHODS: Patients with lung cancer with ALK rearrangement were screened from September 2011 to February 2018 at our institute. CSF and paired plasma were tested by next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: LMs were diagnosed in 30 (10.3%) of 291 patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer. A total of 11 paired CSF and plasma samples tested by next-generation sequencing were analyzed. Driver genes were detected in 81.8% of  the CSF samples (9 of 11) and 45.5% of the plasma samples (5 of 11) (p = 0.183).  The maximum allelic fractions were all higher in CSF than in plasma (p = 0.009).  ALK and tumor protein p53 gene (TP53) were the two most frequently mutated genes  in CSF. Gatekeeper gene ALK G1202R and C1156F mutations were identified in CSF after resistance to alectinib. Multiple copy number variants were mainly found in CSF, including in EGFR, cyclin D1 gene (CCND1), fibroblast growth factor 3 gene (FGF3), and fibroblast growth factor 4 gene (FGF4). Also found were v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog gene (MYC) copy number gains and TP53 and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A gene (CDKN2A) copy number deletions. Brigatinib seemed to be effective in controlling LM. One case showed that CSF could be used to monitor disease development of LM and longitudinally monitor tumor response. CONCLUSION: Liquid biopsy of CSF is more sensitive than liquid biopsy of plasma to detect targetable alterations, characterizing resistance mechanisms on progression and monitoring tumor response in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC with LM. Thus, CSF might be promising as a medium of liquid biopsy in LM.",ALK,1

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in a predominantly Chinese patient population with previously treated NSCLC. METHODS: CheckMate 078 was a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial in  patients from China, Russia, and Singapore with squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC that had progressed during/after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02613507). Patients with EGFR/ALK alterations were excluded. Patients (N = 504) were randomized 2:1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks), stratified by performance status, tumor histology, and tumor programmed death ligand 1 expression. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included objective response rate, progression-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: OS was significantly improved with nivolumab (n = 338) versus docetaxel  (n = 166); median OS (95% confidence interval): 12.0 (10.4-14.0) versus 9.6 (7.6-11.2) months, respectively; hazard ratio (97.7% confidence interval): 0.68 (0.52-0.90); p = 0.0006. Objective response rate was 17% with nivolumab versus 4% with docetaxel; median duration of response was not reached versus 5.3 months. Minimum follow-up was 8.8 months. The frequency of grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events was 10% with nivolumab and 48% with docetaxel. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first phase III study in a predominantly Chinese population reporting results with a programmed death 1 inhibitor. In this population with previously treated advanced NSCLC, nivolumab improved OS versus docetaxel. Results were consistent with global CheckMate 017 and 057 studies.",ALK,1

To facilitate population-based research in molecularly defined subgroups of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we assessed the validity of natural language  processing (NLP) for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK testing from electronic pathology (e-path) reports of NSCLC cases included in two SEER registries: the Cancer Surveillance System (CSS) and the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR). METHODS: We obtained 4,278 e-path reports from 1,634 patients who were diagnosed  with stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC from September 1, 2011, to December 31, 2013, included in CSS. We used 855 CSS reports to train NLP systems for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK test status (reported v not reported) and test results (positive v negative). We assessed sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values in an internal validation sample of 3,423 CSS e-path reports and repeated the analysis in an external sample of 1,041 e-path reports from 565 KCR patients. Two oncologists manually reviewed all e-path reports to generate gold-standard data sets. RESULTS: NLP systems yielded internal validity metrics that ranged from 0.95 to 1.00 for EGFR and ALK test status and results in CSS e-path reports. NLP showed high internal accuracy for the ascertainment of EGFR and ALK in CSS patients-F cores of 0.95 and 0.96",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Apr 10.,Alectinib versus crizotinib in untreated Asian patients with anaplastic lymphoma  kinase-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ALESIA): a randomised phase 3 study.,"BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK-positive) disease occurs in  approximately 5% of all patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, with a similar  incidence reported in Asian patients. This study is the first phase 3 randomised  trial recruiting only Asian patients to compare alectinib with crizotinib as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer with 600 mg of alectinib twice per day. This study assessed consistency of the progression-free  survival benefit with the global phase 3 ALEX study. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 21 investigational sites in China, South Korea, and Thailand, Asian patients, aged 18 years or older, with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (2:1)  to twice-daily oral alectinib (600 mg) or crizotinib (250 mg). Patients were randomly assigned via a block-stratified (block size three) randomisation procedure, done centrally via an interactive voice or web response system, with stratification by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and baseline CNS metastases. Clinical staff and the funder's drug safety and medical  monitoring staff had access to treatment assignments. The independent review committee was masked to treatment assignment, and funder personnel did not have access to efficacy and safety summaries by treatment group, before the formal reporting of study results. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were permitted. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The primary analysis population for efficacy was the intention-to-treat population, defined as all randomly assigned patients. The primary analysis population for safety was defined as all patients who received at least one dose  of study medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02838420. FINDINGS: Between Aug 3, 2016, and May 16, 2017, 187 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 125 to alectinib and 62 to crizotinib. Median follow-up was 16·2 months (IQR 13·7-17·6) in the alectinib group, and 15·0 months (12·5-17·3) in the crizotinib group. Investigator-assessed progression-free survival was significantly prolonged with alectinib versus crizotinib (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22, 95% CI 0·13-0·38; p<0·0001; median progression-free survival not estimable vs 11·1 months). Independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was also significantly longer in the alectinib group compared with the crizotinib group (HR 0·37, 0·22-0·61; p<0·0001). The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 114 (91%) of 125 with alectinib, and 48 (77%)  of 62 with crizotinib, with a longer duration of response for alectinib than crizotinib (HR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12-0·40; p<0·0001). Time to CNS progression (cause-specific HR 0·14) and the percentage of patients who achieved a CNS objective response with measurable or non-measurable baseline CNS lesions were improved (32 [73%] of 44 patients treated with alectinib vs five [22%] of 23 patients treated with crizotinib). Despite longer treatment duration with alectinib than crizotinib (14·7 months vs 12·6 months, respectively), fewer patients had grade 3-5 adverse events (36 [29%] of 125 vs 30 [48%] of 62, respectively) or serious adverse events (19 [15%] of 125 vs 16 [26%] of 62, respectively).

Epub 2019 Mar 25.,"Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (IMpower150): key subgroup analyses of patients with EGFR mutations or baseline liver metastases in a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial.","BACKGROUND: The IMpower150 trial showed significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ABCP) versus the standard-of-care bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (BCP) in chemotherapy-naive patients with non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Here, we report the efficacy of ABCP or  atezolizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel (ACP) versus BCP in key patient subgroups. METHODS: IMpower150 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done at 240 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 26 countries worldwide. Patients with chemotherapy-naive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive ABCP, ACP, or BCP every three weeks. The co-primary endpoints were overall survival and investigator-assessed progression-free survival in intention-to-treat wild-type patients (patients with epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] or anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] genetic alterations were excluded). Efficacy was assessed in key subgroups within the intention-to-treat population, including patients with EGFR mutations (both sensitising and non-sensitising; EGFR-positive) previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors and patients with baseline liver metastases. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was included among secondary efficacy endpoints. Exploratory endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving an objective response in the intention-to-treat population, including EGFR-positive patients and patients with baseline liver metastases. Data are reported as per the Jan 22, 2018, data cutoff date, at which the number  of coprimary prespecified overall survival events was met in the ABCP versus BCP  groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02366143, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2015, and Dec 30, 2016, 1202 patients were enrolled.  400 patients were randomly assigned to ABCP, 402 to ACP, and 400 to BCP. In EGFR-positive patients (124 of 1202), median overall survival was not estimable (NE; 95% CI 17·0-NE) with ABCP (34 of 400) and 18·7 months (95% CI 13·4-NE) with  BCP (45 of 400; hazard ratio [HR] 0·61 [95% CI 0·29-1·28]). Improved overall survival with ABCP versus BCP was observed in patients with sensitising EGFR mutations (median overall survival NE [95% CI NE-NE] with ABCP [26 of 400] vs 17·5 months [95% CI 11·7-NE] with BCP [32 of 400]; HR 0·31 [95% CI 0·11-0·83]) and in the intention-to-treat population (19·8 months [17·4-24·2] vs 14·9 months 13·4-17·1]; HR 0·76 [0·63-0·93]). Improved median overall survival with ABCP versus BCP was seen in patients with baseline liver metastases (13·3 months [11·6-NE] with ABCP [52 of 400] vs 9·4 months [7·9-11·7] with BCP [57 of 400]; HR 0·52 [0·33-0·82]). Median overall survival was 21·4 months (95% CI 13·8-NE) with  ACP versus 18·7 months (95% CI 13·4-NE) with BCP in EGFR-positive patients (HR 0·93 [95% CI 0·51-1·68]). No overall survival benefit was seen with ACP versus BCP in patients with sensitising EGFR mutations (HR 0·90 [95% CI 0·47-1·74]), in  the intention-to-treat population (HR 0·85 [0·71-1·03]), or in patients with baseline liver metastases (HR 0·87 [0·57-1·32]). In the intention-to-treat safety-evaluable population, grade 3-4 treatment-related events occurred in 223 (57%) patients in the ABCP group, in 172 (43%) in the ACP group, and in 191 (49%) in the BCP group; 11 (3%) grade 5 adverse events occurred in the ABCP group, as did four (1%) in the ACP group, and nine (2%) in the BCP group. INTERPRETATION: Improved survival was noted for patients treated with ABCP compared with those given BCP in the intention-to-treat population, and in patients with baseline liver metastases. The overall survival signal in the subgroup of patients with EGFR sensitising mutations warrants further study. FUNDING: F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Genentech.",ALK,1

The value of more comprehensive sequencing is unknown. METHODS: Prospective ctDNA analysis in patients with EGFRm NSCLC was performed using a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel of regions of 11 genes detecting single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions at ≥0.1% variant allele frequency (VAF) was performed. Patients were grouped according to treatment phase, including: (A) pre EGFR-TKI, (B) stable or responding to EGFR-TKI, (C) radiographic progression during EGFR-TKI, and (D) during chemotherapy treatment. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with stage IV EGFRm NSCLC were enrolled and first blood samples were analysed. Primary sensitizing mutations in del19 or L858R were present in 66 (92%) and uncommon EGFRm in 6 (8%). Mutations in ctDNA were found in 53 samples (74%). T790M was detected in 3 of 4 patients with T790M-negative tissue. Other co-occurring EGFRm were found in 10 patients (7%) including K745R during first-line osimertinib. TP53 (n = 10), KRAS (n = 1), PI3KCA (n = 1) and ALK (n = 3) gene mutations also were detected. The presence of an EGFRm (excluding T790M) was associated with untreated or progressive disease, p = 0.04. In TKI-treated patients without radiologic progression, median progression free survival (PFS) was 10 months versus 2.1 months (HR 2.22, 95% CI: 0.89-5.54, p = 0.08) if an EGFRm in ctDNA was detected. If T790M was present in ctDNA, median PFS was 3.0 months versus 9.7 months (HR 4.59, 95% CI: 1.43-14.73, p = 0.005). High % VAF of both EGFRm and T790M correlated with inferior PFS (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03 respectively). CONCLUSION: In addition to the emergence of resistance mutations, the presence of the primary or co-occurring EGFRm in patients receiving EGFR-TKIs may associate with shorter PFS and may be useful in longitudinal analyses of ctDNA to direct therapy.",ALK,1

However, there is limited information regarding the impact of these advances on patient survival in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC who received any treatment in the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research (JFCR) between January 1, 1995 and March 1, 2017.  A total of 1,547 consecutive patients were included in this case series. In this  analysis, five diagnostic periods were evaluated: 1995-1999 (period A), 2000-2004 (period B), 2005-2009 (period C), 2010-2014 (period D), and 2015-2017 (period E). We compared overall survival (OS) between the periods before and after propensity score matching (PSM) and in patients with EGFR mutation, with ALK fusion gene, or without driver mutation. RESULTS: In the past two decades the OS of patients with stage IV NSCLC improved. The median OSs for periods A, B, C, D, and E were 9.0, 11.0, 13.7, 17.9 months, and not reached, respectively. After PSM with known baseline characteristics, the trend of improvement in OS was similar. However, the OS of patients with EGFR mutation or ALK fusion gene did not improve between periods, despite the availability of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Japan. The OS of patients without a driver mutation was slightly longer in the period E. CONCLUSION: The introduction of new classes of drugs has significantly improved the survival of patients with stage IV NSCLC. However, the approval of similar types of drugs may not be associated with further improvement in survival.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Mar 20.,"Comparison of ALK detection by FISH, IHC and NGS to predict benefit from crizotinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","PURPOSE: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is now a validated kinase target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We implemented three ALK laboratory methodologies: fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect EML4-ALK fusions and compared the predictive value for Crizotinib efficacy in ALK-positive patients. METHODS: 55 ALK positive patients confirmed by at least one method were enrolled  in the present study, of whom 45 cases were assessed by FISH, IHC and NGS concurrently, and another 10 cases only received IHC and NGS assessment for ALK status. RESULTS: IHC presented the uppermost positive rate (94.5%), followed by NGS (92.7%) and FISH(82.4%), among which IHC and NGS had the highest concordance rate of 87.3%. No difference was detected in ORR, DCR and PFS of ALK positive cases defined in three groups. Notably, NGS positive patients were correlated with a higher DCR and longer PFS compared to NGS negative cases (P = 0.02 and P = 0.09), while FISH and IHC status were not distinguishing in predicting the outcome of Crizotinib. TP53 concurrent mutation might reduce responsiveness to Crizotinib and worsen prognosis in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. CONCLUSION: FISH present a certain false-negative rate although considered the gold standard. Ventana-D5F3 IHC is qualified as a screening tool, while NGS positive may predict clinical benefit of Crizotinib more accurately, allowing efficient test for specific variants and concurrent genomic alterations.",ALK,1

Epub 2019  Mar 18.,A molecular graded prognostic assessment (molGPA) model specific for estimating survival in lung cancer patients with leptomeningeal metastases.,"OBJECTIVES: Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) had increased in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over the last 10 years. The survival outcome remained overall poor, heterogeneous and was reported in association with genotypes in lung cancer patients with LM. Graded prognostic assessment model integrated with molecular alterations (molGPA) might be accurate for outcome prediction of LM patients, but needs to be established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively screened 8921 consecutive lung cancer patients from January 2011 to March 2018. A total of 301 patients diagnosed as LM were enrolled, and randomly divided into training and validation sets after stratified by gender and age. A molGPA score for each patient was calculated based on the weighted significant parameters including gene mutations. RESULT: The median OS for the 301 patients was 9.2 months (95%CI: 7.9-10.5). In the training set, EGFR/ALK positivity, Karnofsky performance score (KPS) score≥60 and absence of extracranial metastasis (ECM) independently predicted better OS. We developed a molGPA model based on above significant prognostic factors. This molGPA model classified LM patients into three prognosis groups of high, intermediate and low risk (molGPA score of 0, 0.5-1.0 and 1.5-2.0, respectively.  The median OS of high, intermediate and low risk LM patients in the training set  was 0.3, 3.5 and 15.9 months, respectively (p < 0.001). In the validation set, the median OS was 0.9, 5.8 and 17.7 months in the three molGPA subgroups, accordingly (p < 0.001). The C-index of this model in training and validation sets was 0.70 (95%CI: 0.66-0.73) and 0.64 (95%CI: 0.58-0.70) respectively. CONCLUSION: The LM molGPA model with integration of gene status, KPS and ECM can  accurately classify lung cancer patients with LM into diverse prognosis.",ALK,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to elucidate whether PE could be used as a surrogate for tumor tissue to detect EGFR mutations. METHODS: We extracted 2 × 2 diagnostic table from each included study and calculated data on specificity, sensitivity, negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR) ,and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). We used the area under curve (AUC) and summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) to summarize the overall diagnostic performance and assessed publication bias by  Deeks' funnel plot. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 15 eligible publications. The following summary estimates for diagnostic parameters of the EGFR mutations detection in PE were made: sensitivity, 0.86 (95%CI 0.83-0.89); specificity, 0.93 (95%CI 0.91-0.95); PLR, 8.53 (95%CI 5,94-12.25); NLR, 0.18 (95%CI 0.13-0.25); DOR, 63.40 (95%CI 38.83-103.51); and AUC, 0.94. Funnel plot indicated publication bias insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis suggests that EGFR mutation detecting in PE, especially supernatants, is a promising surrogate for tumor tissue in EGFR mutations testing of patients with NSCLC.",ALK,1

In the present report, a 61-year-old male patient was hospitalized due to cough, dyspnea, and right chest pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed spot- and piece-shaped shadows. The patient became very weak and had  breathing difficulty after preliminary anti-pneumonia treatment with cefoperazone-sulbactam. Physical examination revealed dull sound by percussion and decreased breath sounds in the right lateral lung areas by auscultation. A second CT scan revealed a large amount of pleural effusion, and the patient was diagnosed with bloody pleural effusion through pleural space puncture. Multiple nodular lesions were found in the right pleural cavity under thoracoscopy. PSC was confirmed by biopsy and histopathology in combination with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) scan indicated multiple bone metastases. KRAS exon 2 mutation and EML4-ALK fusion were identified in carcinoma tissue by IHC and amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR. The patient received one cycle of first-line combination chemotherapy of cisplatin and paclitaxel liposomes. However, the patient did not  respond to the platinum-based combination chemotherapy within 3 weeks and was thus administered oral crizotinib instead of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, he still had rapid disease progression and died 2 weeks after the initiation of crizotinib treatment. Collectively, our results suggest that a PSC patient with coexistent KRAS mutation and ALK rearrangement would not benefit from chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment.",ALK,1

The current study aimed to investigate the feasibility of cytological specimens for ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine  kinase (ROS1) fusion detection by RT-PCR in advanced NSCLC patients. Patients and methods: A total of 2,538 patients with advanced NSCLC, including 2,101 patients with cytological specimens and 437 patients with tumor tissues, were included in this study. All patients were screened for ROS1 fusion status by RT-PCR. The efficacy of crizotinib treatment was evaluated in ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC patients. Results: Among 2,101 patients with cytological specimens, the average concentration of RNA acquired from cytological specimens was 47.68 ng/μL (95% CI, 43.24-52.62), which was lower than the average of 66.54 ng/μL (95% CI, 57.18-76.60, P=0.001) obtained from 437 tumor tissues. Fifty-five patients harbored ROS1 fusion gene that was detected by RT-PCR, and 14 of them were treated with crizotinib. The incidence of ROS1 fusion was 1.95% (41/2,101) in 2,101 patients with cytological specimens, similar to the rate of 3.20% (14/437,  P=0.102) for the 437 patients with tumor tissue. Regarding crizotinib treatment,  no statistically significant differences were observed in the objective response  rate (ORR) (81.8% vs 100%, P=0.604) between the cytological and tissue subgroups  of ROS1-positive patients.

Epub 2019 Feb 27.,Efficient ten-gene analysis of NSCLC tissue samples by next-generation sequencing.,"In the era of personalized medicine, lung cancer is a typical disease which can be treated strategically based on the patient's histological and molecular diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), Sanger sequencing and real-time PCR are techniques commonly used in clinical laboratories. Many patients are required to use several of the above technologies to get a complete diagnosis, which is expensive and timeconsuming. Next generation of sequencing (NGS) has the advantage to simultaneously analyze multigene mutations. The average cost for each patient is affordable if each run  contains a certain number of samples. In this study, we tested a 10-gene, 32-mutation detection NGS method, which was used to test 195 samples from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sanger sequencing and Amplification-refractory Mutation System (AMRS) PCR were employed to verify Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) results. This NGS method was partially proved to have a higher sensitivity to detect mutations with low abundance than Sanger sequencing and even ARMS PCR. Using genomic DNA to detect gene fusions may have some disadvantages to miss low  abundance or large fragment fusions. As compared to using a few different technologies to analyze multigene mutations, small NGS analysis panel is a clinically applicable, efficient and affordable choice for NSCLC patients.",ALK,1

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) invited the company  that manufactures ceritinib (Zykadia®, Novartis) to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug, as a first-line treatment for adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive (+) advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as part of the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process. The CRD (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination) and CHE (Centre for Health Economics) Technology Assessment Group at the University of York was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the  Company's submission (CS), the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The evidence submitted in support of ceritinib, as the first-line treatment in ALK+ advanced NSCLC, was a phase III, international, multicentre, open-label randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing ceritinib with pemetrexed/cisplatin plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy (chemotherapy [CT] group). The results indicated that ceritinib prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with  CT. The only comparator considered in the CS was crizotinib. The evidence selected in support of crizotinib was PROFILE 1014, an open-label RCT of crizotinib, compared with pemetrexed/cisplatin CT (without maintenance therapy),  in previously untreated advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC. The design and population of PROFILE 1014 was similar to that of ASCEND-4, though there were some differences between the trials. The Company considered it not possible to perform an 'anchor-based' analysis of first-line ceritinib and crizotinib, and presented a Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) of ceritinib and crizotinib using only the ALK inhibitor arm of ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014. The indirect comparison suggests that ceritinib may be more effective in prolonging PFS than crizotinib. The ERG agreed that an indirect comparison using only the ALK inhibitor arm of the trials was the only option available in the present assessment; however, a number of limitations and potential bias were identified in this analysis. The Company's model estimated that ceritinib was cost effective when compared with crizotinib. However, the ERG highlighted several concerns with the Company's analysis; the ERG's preferred base case estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £69,255 per quality-adjusted life-year (no patient access scheme [PAS] included). The ERG considered the economic analysis to be sensitive to changes in assumption used, partly due to the due to the immaturity  of the overall survival data from trials, which leads to uncertainty around the extrapolation used. The NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that ceritinib is recommended, within its marketing authorisation, as an option for untreated ALK+  advanced NSCLC in adults, if the Company provides it with the discount agreed in  the PAS.",ALK,1

Epub 2019  Apr 16.,Clinical features and outcomes of ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer with  primary resistance to crizotinib.,"BACKGROUND: Crizotinib is associated with a favorable survival benefit in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, a subset  of patients harboring ALK rearrangement shows a poor response. METHODS: We collected the clinical features and survival outcomes of 28 primary-resistant responders (PRR) with progression-free survival (PFS) of < 3 months on crizotinib and compared these with 78 long-term responders (LTR) that achieved > 24 months PFS (control). RESULTS: Primary resistance was observed in 6.5% of the patients. The median PFS  of the PRR and LTR groups was 1.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.73) and 47.0 months (95% CI 34.39-59.64), respectively. A better Eastern Cooperative  Oncology Group performance status score was significantly associated with longer  PFS (odds ratio 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.33; P = 0.001). The median overall survival (OS) of the PRR group was 8.4 months (95% CI 3.47-13.42) and crizotinib as first-line treatment was an independent predictive factor for survival outcome (P = 0.005). Patients administered ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitors after crizotinib progression had significantly longer survival than the PRR group treated with best supportive care (P = 0.007), but no significant difference was  found between ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment and single chemotherapy (P = 0.944). CONCLUSION: Patients with primary resistance to crizotinib displayed unfavorable  survival outcomes and the underlying mechanism cannot be identified in clinical features. Nevertheless, next-generation ALK inhibitors and chemotherapy after crizotinib progression could confer a therapeutic and survival benefit in this population.  © 2019 The Authors.

Unfortunately, the majority of ALK-positive patients ultimately develop acquired resistance within one year after the initiation of crizotinib treatment; however, the estimation of overall survival (OS) beyond crizotinib resistance has not yet been fully demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to identify favorable predictors affecting survival outcome. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, the data of 136 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC beyond crizotinib resistance were analyzed between January 2013 and December 2017. Patients were divided into two groups according to intracranial or extracranial progression on crizotinib, and sequential therapies including crizotinib continuation with local therapy, next-generation ALK inhibitors, and chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the median OS duration from the start of crizotinib resistance to death or the last follow-up. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses of OS were carried out. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, 60 (41.1%) of the 136 patients had died. Median progression free survival (PFS) and OS from the metastatic diagnosis were 10.4 and 41.3 months, respectively. Sequential therapies administered beyond crizotinib treatment were: next-generation ALK inhibitors (54 patients), chemotherapy (20 patients), and crizotinib continuation with local therapy (62 patients).

Clinical data of 35 patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC were collected from Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Whole blood samples from the peripheral vein were taken at different treatment periods, and the mutations of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) were detected. Multivariate analysis showed that smoking (P = 0.0308), mutation number > 2 (P = 0.0283), and max mutation frequency > 0.025 (P = 0.0450) were associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS). The overall survival (OS) of well-differentiated NSCLC patients was better than that of poorly differentiated ones (P = 0.0006). The rates of PFS, disease-free survival, local-regional recurrence-free survival, and local-regional progression-free survival were significantly higher in the group with a mutation number > 2 than in the group with a mutation number ≤ 2. The mutation number of the preoperation group was significantly higher than that of the postradiochemotherapy group (5 vs. 2.5, P = 0.023), and the max mutation frequency change was approximately significant in the postradiochemotherapy group compared with the postoperation group (2.6% vs. 1.85%, P = 0.067). The max mutation frequency is positively correlated with vascular invasion (21.13% vs. 3.62%, P = 0.04). Furthermore, Met, ALK, APC, PTEN, ERBB4, NF1, and other genes,  involving multiple tumor suppressor genes and lung cancer-driven genes, did not mutate in recurrence-free patients when compared with recurrent patients. In conclusion, differentiation, smoking, mutation frequency > 0.025, and mutation number > 2 are prognostic factors. The frequency and number of gene mutations in  cfDNA are expected to be prognostic predictors of NSCLC.",ALK,1

Recently, anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors have been used for treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung cancer, and their high clinical effect has also been demonstrated in cases of advanced stage lung cancer. Alectinib is an anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor that it is recognized as a standard drug  for primary therapy because of its superiority to crizotinib. CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital due to multiple brain metastases. An autopsy report revealed that the cause of death was anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung cancer, exacerbated in a short period despite treatment with alectinib. Necropsy revealed anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung, suggesting that it was involved in the prognosis of this patient. Based on the autopsy results, we reviewed the pathological tissue from transbronchial lung biopsy at the time of clinical diagnosis. The tissue specimen for clinical diagnosis in this case was a papillary adenocarcinoma. However, when this tissue was immunostained, thyroid transcription factor 1-negative and cytokeratin 5/6-positive parts were recognized. This result indicates that we could diagnose this patient as having had adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung. CONCLUSION: In cases of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung cancer poorly responsive to anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors, re-examination of the tissue should be considered because there is a possibility of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adenosquamous carcinoma.",ALK,1

The  aims of this study were 1) to assess the adequacy of cytologic specimens for PD-L1 evaluation and 2) to explore correlations of PD-L1 expression with clinicopathologic and molecular features. METHODS: The study cohort included 100 cytology specimens (fluid [n = 28] and fine-needle aspiration [n = 72]) and 165 surgical specimens (biopsy [n = 138] and resection [n = 27]). The PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 22C3 assay and staining assessment were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. PD-L1 expression was correlated with patients' demographics, pathologic characteristics, and molecular alterations. RESULTS: One hundred forty-two specimens (53.6%) were positive for PD-L1 expression (≥1%). No statistically significant difference in PD-L1 expression was identified between cytologic (56.0%) and surgical specimens (52.1%). Seventy-four of 190 tested cases (38.9%) had genetic alterations. PD-L1 positivity was significantly more prevalent in cases with genetic alterations than in cases without genetic alterations. Furthermore, both PD-L1 positivity and high PD-L1 expression (≥50%) had statistically significant associations with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations. PD-L1 expression had no significant association with histologic phenotypes or other clinicopathologic features. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that cytologic specimens are comparable to surgical specimens for PD-L1 evaluation. The association of PD-L1 expression with KRAS mutations may have clinical relevance in selecting patients with NSCLC for immunotherapy.  © 2019 American Cancer Society.",ALK,1

Crizotinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) has been considered as the standard of care for advanced ALK-positive lung cancer but it only gives a median progression-free survival of 7.7-11 months. CASE: A 41-year-old old man, former smoker, was diagnosed with NSCLC in the right lung with manifest pleural effusion. This case was complicated by a pleural empyema and because of a trapped lung, there was an indication for the construction of a thoracostomy. After confirmation of the ALK translocation, therapy with crizotinib was started. After 8 weeks, there was excellent response, and 6 months later, all lesions were undetectable on CT scan. There was also complete healing of the thoracostomy wound. CONCLUSION: This case describes a relatively young patient with a poor prognosis  but with a remarkable and long-term response to crizotinib monotherapy.",ALK,1

Recent years have witnessed a growing number of licensed second-line pharmacotherapies for advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With the aim of gauging patient survival benefit, we conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) and compared survival outcomes from available licensed treatments for patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC. METHODS: RCTs of second/third line treatments in participants with advanced/metastatic NSCLC and negative/low expression of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) were included. We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE; EMBASE; Web of Science) from January, 2000 up to July, 2017. Two or more independent reviewers screened bibliographic records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of studies. Published Kaplan Meier plots for OS and PFS along with restricted-mean-survival methods and parametric modelling were used to estimate the survival outcomes as mean number of months of survival. Network meta-analysis was undertaken to rank interventions and to make indirect comparisons. RESULTS: We included 11 RCTs with data for 7581 participants that compared nine different drugs. In studies of patients regardless of histology groups, targeted  drugs (ramucirumab and nintedanib) yielded small overall survival gains of < 2.5 months over docetaxel, erlotinib provided no benefit, while immunotherapies (atezolizumab and pembrolizumab) delivered 5 to 6 months gain. Studies with patients stratified by histology confirmed the apparent superiority of immunotherapy (nivolumab and atezolizumab) over targeted treatments (ramucirumab, nintedanib, afatinib) providing between about 4 to 8 months OS gain over docetaxel. In network analysis immunotherapies consistently ranked higher than alternatives irrespective of population histology and outcome measure. CONCLUSION: Our review indicates that nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab provide superior survival benefits compared to other licensed drugs for late stage NSCLC. Patient gains from these immunotherapies are substantial compared to the expected average survival with chemotherapy (docetaxel) of < 1 year for people with squamous histology and about 1.25 year for those with non-squamous histology.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Concomitant EGFR Mutation and EML4-ALK Rearrangement in Lung Adenocarcinoma Is More Frequent in Multifocal Lesions.,"BACKGROUND: The coexistence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement in patients with multifocal lung adenocarcinomas (LUAC) constitutes a rare molecular subtype of lung cancer.  We aimed to investigate the intertumoral heterogeneity of pathologic and genetic  characteristics of multifocal LUAC with EGFR/ALK co-alterations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1059 LUAC patients who underwent resection were  investigated to screen for EGFR or ALK alterations using amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry/fluorescence in situ hybridization. Molecular testing was extensively performed in patients with synchronous multifocal LUAC. Clonal evolution analysis was implemented using next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 97 multiple synchronous lesions were observed among 1059 LUAC patients. Patients with at least 1 sample harboring EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement were 62.89% (61/97) and 14.43% (14/97), respectively. Patients with concomitant EGFR and ALK alterations were 4.71% (4/97). Comparatively, patients with unifocal LUAC harboring EGFR mutation, ALK rearrangement, and EGFR/ALK co-alterations were 58.25% (570/962), 6.44% (62/962), and 0.83% (8/962), respectively. The prevalence of EGFR/ALK co-alterations in the multifocal LUAC was significantly higher than that in the unifocal LUAC (4.71% (4/97) vs. 0.83% (8/962)). Furthermore, we present 4 cases of EGFR/ALK co-altered multifocal LUAC  with different morphological and molecular patterns. In addition to radiographic, pathological, and molecular testing results, clonal evolutional analysis could also be used to distinguish intertumoral heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the importance of distinguishing synchronous primary tumors from intrapulmonary metastases, and of assessing the relative abundance of EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement in patients with multifocal adenocarcinomas with EGFR/ALK co-alterations.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of  print],Intracranial remission with brigatinib rechallenge as fifth-line ALK inhibition therapy in a lung cancer patient.,"Several anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of EML4-ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer, with the newer generation agents brigatinib, alectinib and lorlatinib showing pronounced central nervous system activities. Intracranial efficacy is an important feature for these agents, as metastatic lesions frequently occur in the central nervous system in the ALK-positive setting. Here, we report on an updated case of a patient who received her diagnosis in 2005 and has had disease progression with new lesions on six occasions over the last 8 years. During the first two progressions, only local recurrence was observed. After that, the lungs stayed clear and the patient progressed exclusively in the brain and spinal cord. Initial treatments consisted of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2012, ALK-directed targeted therapy became available, and crizotinib was administered.  The treatment was switched to brigatinib 3 years later because of spinal cord lesions. Brigatinib induced partial remission and was followed by lorlatinib and, later on, alectinib, when new metastases arose in the spinal cord and brain. Each of these drugs promoted complete remission of the recent lesions. In November 2018, imaging showed multiple cerebral metastases. As radiotherapy was not an option because of previous irradiation, and as chemotherapy cannot be expected to be active in the brain, the patient underwent brigatinib rechallenge, which led to partial remission. All of the central nervous system relapses were symptomatic, with symptoms resolved rapidly during treatment. This case of a patient with EML4-ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer shows that sequential treatment with next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including rechallenge, can induce profound remission even in heavily pretreated patients, especially if the central nervous system is the site of progression.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Application of time-dependent modeling for the exposure-efficacy analysis of ceritinib in untreated ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC patients.,"PURPOSE: Ceritinib 750 mg/day was approved for the treatment of patients with untreated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) based on ASCEND-4 study. The objective of this article is to introduce the use of time-dependent modeling approach in the updated exposure-efficacy analysis of ceritinib for the first-line indication. METHODS: Exposure-efficacy analyses, including data from 156 patients, were first conducted using time-independent logistic regression model for response of complete or partial response and Cox regression model for progression-free survival (PFS). The exposure measure used was average Ctrough, which is defined as the geometric mean of all evaluable Ctrough for each patient. To further investigate the impact of exposure measure on exposure-efficacy analyses, a time-dependent modeling approach was used, where exposure at different time intervals was associated with the corresponding response endpoints in a longitudinal manner. RESULTS: With exposure measure being average Ctrough, it was observed that higher exposure was associated with reduced efficacy in terms of response (odds ratio = 0.77) and PFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.12]. These time-independent models do not account for the impact of time-varying concentration due to dose modifications. Subsequently, a new time-dependent modeling approach was used, where exposure and efficacy were associated longitudinally in the analyses. The results showed that the odds ratio of response became 1.07, and the HR of PFS became 1.04, indicating no apparent reverse relationship between exposure and efficacy across the exposure range studied. CONCLUSION: The drug effect on efficacy in clinical trials could be better characterized using time-dependent exposure-response models.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Treatment status and safety of crizotinib in 2028 Japanese patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in clinical settings.,"OBJECTIVE: Post-marketing surveillance (PMS) was performed in Japan to obtain information on the safety and efficacy of crizotinib. METHODS: Target patients included almost all patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small cell lung cancer who were administered crizotinib. The  observation period was 52 weeks. In the present study, we focused on the treatment status and safety of crizotinib therapy and analyzed the real-world data obtained by this PMS (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01597258). RESULTS: The safety analysis set included 2028 Japanese patients, and more than half of the patients (56.4%) were nonsmokers. The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 91.6%, and common ADRs (incidence ≥15%) were nausea (32.2%), diarrhea (24.3%), photopsia (18.9%), vomiting (17.5%) and dysgeusia (16.8%). Many patients (623 patients) discontinued treatment of crizotinib because of adverse events within 12 weeks after therapy initiation, which tended to frequently occur in the following cases: (1) elderly, (2) body weight <40 kg, (3) body surface area <1.2 m2 (4) ECOG PS 2-4, (5) higher Brinkman index and (6) history of occupational/environmental exposure such as asbestos/pneumoconiosis. The proportions of patients remaining on crizotinib therapy were 68.2% for 3 months,  55.2% for 6 months and 36.1% for 12 months, with a median duration of 7.9 months. Multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional hazard model identified 10 statistically significant patient background factors influencing the duration of  crizotinib therapy. CONCLUSIONS: No new safety concerns were observed in this PMS study. Our results  provide useful information regarding the status of crizotinib therapy in the clinical setting.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Real-World Clinical Impact of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer After Platinum Chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: The real-world effect of anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapies is unclear. We compared US patients who received second-line therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before and shortly after US Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) approval of PD-L1 inhibitors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients in the Flatiron Health database (≥18 years; received first-line platinum therapy for advanced/metastatic NSCLC; ≥6 months of  follow-up) were assessed before (historical: January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013) and after (current: January 1, 2015 to May 31, 2017) FDA approval of anti-PD-L1 therapies for NSCLC. Index was start of second-line therapy. Baseline  variables, treatment patterns, and overall survival (OS) were reported. RESULTS: A greater proportion of patients in the current cohort received second-line treatment than in the historical cohort (n = 4240 [57.0%] vs. n = 2357 [37.4%]); 48.8% [n = 2071] of the current second-line patients received anti-PD-L1 therapy. Current patients were more likely to receive second-line anti-PD-L1 therapy if they had poorer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (≥2), had squamous histology, or had no epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), or ROS proto-oncogene 1 mutations. Median OS from index was higher in the current cohort (9.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.9-9.9] months) than the historical cohort (7.3 [95% CI, 6.9-7.8] months). Adjusted for sex, race, ECOG performance status, disease stage, and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, EGFR, and ALK status, OS was improved by 15% in the current cohort. CONCLUSION: Contemporary patients are more likely to receive second-line therapy  and have longer OS than patients who received care before approval of anti-PD-L1  therapies.",ALK,1

The first biopsy of the patient suggested inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, ALK (D5F3) positive. Considering the benign progression of the disease, and no indication for surgical resection, oral prednisone was given first. However, the disease rapidly progressed, and a second biopsy revealed a pulmonary sarcomatoid cancer. Since the biopsy was ALK (D5F3) positive, the effect of crizotinib treatment was significant, though crizotinib resistance unfortunately  only occurred after 4 months. The third biopsy pathology was performed and confirmed lung adenocarcinoma. After switching to pembrolizumab treatment, the lesions were significantly reduced after four courses of treatment.

[Epub ahead of  print],Clinical Utility of Comprehensive Cell-free DNA Analysis to Identify Genomic Biomarkers in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Purpose: Complete and timely tissue genotyping is challenging, leading to significant numbers of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) being undergenotyped for all eight genomic biomarkers recommended by professional guidelines. We aimed to demonstrate noninferiority of comprehensive cell-free DNA (cfDNA) relative to physician discretion standard-of-care (SOC) tissue genotyping to identify guideline-recommended biomarkers in patients with mNSCLC.Patients and Methods: Prospectively enrolled patients with previously untreated mNSCLC undergoing physician discretion SOC tissue genotyping submitted a pretreatment blood sample for comprehensive cfDNA analysis (Guardant360).Results: Among 282 patients, physician discretion SOC tissue genotyping identified a guideline-recommended biomarker in 60 patients versus 77 cfDNA identified patients (21.3% vs. 27.3%; P < 0.0001 for noninferiority). In tissue-positive patients, the biomarker was identified alone  (12/60) or concordant with cfDNA (48/60), an 80% cfDNA clinical sensitivity for any guideline-recommended biomarker. For FDA-approved targets (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF) concordance was >98.2% with 100% positive predictive value for cfDNA versus tissue (34/34 EGFR-, ALK-, or BRAF-positive patients). Utilizing cfDNA, in addition to tissue, increased detection by 48%, from 60 to 89 patients, including those with negative, not assessed, or insufficient tissue results. cfDNA median turnaround time was significantly faster than tissue (9 vs. 15 days; P < 0.0001). Guideline-complete genotyping was significantly more likely (268 vs. 51; P < 0.0001).Conclusions: In the largest cfDNA study in previously untreated mNSCLC, a validated comprehensive cfDNA test identifies guideline-recommended biomarkers at a rate at least as high as SOC tissue genotyping, with high tissue concordance, more rapidly and completely than tissue-based genotyping.",ALK,1

We recently observed that high-dose (final concentration in vivo: ~10 µM)  crizotinib can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells lacking ALK/ROS1 activation through off-target effects that require the inhibition of several other tyrosine kinases. When combined with cisplatin (which alone does not induce ICD), crizotinib sensitizes NSCLC models to subsequent immunotherapy with PD-1 blockade, allowing to cure more than 90% of established orthotopic cancers. Of note, simultaneous treatment of mice with cisplatin, crizotinib and PD-1 blocking antibodies causes acute hepatotoxicity that can be avoided by a sequential regimen involving initial treatment with cisplatin plus crizotinib, followed by PD-1 blockade one week later. It will be important to translate these results obtained in mice into a clinical trial in NSCLC patients.",ALK,1

Known mutations were ascertained through the Sequenom LungCarta panel of 214 mutations in 26 genes, RET/ROS1 fusions, amplification of  FGFR1, and expression of ALK. Paired tumor and normal DNA was whole-exome sequenced for a subset of cases without known driver mutations.Results: Of the 193 tumors tested, 77 known driver mutations were identified in 66 patients (34.2%). Sixty-seven of the 127 patients without a known driver mutation were sequenced. In 54 of these patients, 50 nonsynonymous mutations were predicted to  have damaging effects among the 26 panel genes, 47 of which are not found in The  Cancer Genome Atlas NSCLC white or African American samples. Analyzing the whole-exome sequence data using MutSig2CV identified a total of 88 genes significantly mutated at FDR q < 0.1. Only 5 of these genes were previously reported as oncogenic.Conclusions: These findings suggest that broader mutation profiling including both known and novel driver genes in African Americans with NSCLC will identify additional mutations that may be useful in treatment decision-making.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of  print],Tumor Volume Analysis as a Predictive Marker for Prolonged Survival in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase-rearranged Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Crizotinib.,"PURPOSE: Targeted inhibition of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been widely  used for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ALK rearrangements. We performed tumor volume analysis of ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC treated with crizotinib to identify an early predictive marker for prolonged survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases of 42 patients with ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC (16 men, 26 women; median age: 55.7 y) treated with crizotinib as their first ALK-directed therapy were retrospectively studied. Tumor volume measurements of dominant lung lesions were performed on baseline computed tomography and follow-up computed tomography at 8 weeks of therapy. The relationships between the 8-week volume change (%) and overall survival (OS) were investigated. RESULTS: The 8-week tumor volume change ranged from -99.3% to 117.5% (median: -57.7%). Using the 25th percentile of the 8-week volume change of -74%, 11 patients with >74% volume decrease at 8 weeks had a significantly longer OS compared with 31 patients with ≤74% decrease (median OS: 92.0 vs. 22.8 mo; P=0.0048). In multivariable analyses using Cox proportional hazards models, the 8-week volume decrease of >74% was significantly associated with longer OS (hazard ratio=0.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.59; Cox P=0.008) after adjusting for tumor stage (stage IV vs. recurrent NSCLC, hazard ratio=5.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.29-24.3; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The 8-week tumor volume decrease of >74% is significantly associated with longer OS in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC treated with crizotinib.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print] ,APK pathway activity plays a key role in PD-L1 expression of lung adenocarcinoma cells.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have improved the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Still, many patients do not respond to these  inhibitors. PD-L1 (CD274) expression, one of the factors that influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, is dynamic. Here, we studied the regulation of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC without targetable genetic alterations in EGFR, ALK, BRAF, ROS1, MET, ERBB2 and RET. Analysis of RNA sequencing data from these NSCLCs revealed that inferred IFNγ, EGFR and MAPK signaling correlated with CD274 gene expression in lung adenocarcinoma. In a representative lung adenocarcinoma cell line panel, stimulation with EGF or IFNγ increased CD274 mRNA and PD-L1 protein and membrane levels, which were further enhanced by combining EGF and IFNγ. Similarly, tumor cell PD-L1 membrane levels increased after coculture with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, using EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and erlotinib or the MEK 1 and 2 inhibitor selumetinib, prevented EGF- and IFNγ-induced CD274 mRNA and PD-L1 protein and membrane upregulation, but had no effect on IFNγ-induced MHC-I upregulation. Interestingly, although IFNγ increases transcriptional activity of  CD274, MAPK signaling also increased stabilization of CD274 mRNA. In conclusion,  MAPK pathway activity plays a key role in EGF- and IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression  in lung adenocarcinoma without targetable genetic alterations and may present a target to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.",ALK,1

Methods: The gene expression profiles were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus  (GEO). The identification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by GeneSpring GX. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to execute gene ontology function and pathway enrichment analysis. The protein interaction network was constructed by Cytoscape. The hub genes were extracted by MCODE and cytoHubba plugin from the network. Then, using BIRC5 as a candidate, the prognostic value in LAD and TN adenocarcinomas was verified by the Kaplan-Meier plotter and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, respectively. Finally, the mechanism of BIRC5 was predicted by a coexpressed network and enrichment analysis. Results: A total of 38 upregulated genes and 121 downregulated genes were identified. 9 hub genes were extracted. Among them, the mRNA expression of 5 genes, namely, BIRC5, MCM4, CDC20, KIAA0101, and TRIP13, were significantly upregulated among TN adenocarcinomas (all P < 0.05). Notably, only the overexpression of BIRC5 was associated with unfavorable overall survival (OS) in  TN adenocarcinomas (log rank P = 0.0037). TN adenocarcinoma patients in the BIRC5 high-expression group suffered from a significantly high risk of distant metastasis (P = 0.046), advanced N stage (P = 0.033), and tumor-bearing (P = 0.031) and deceased status (P = 0.003). The mechanism of BIRC5 and coexpressed genes may be linked closely with the cell cycle. Conclusion: Overexpressed in tumors, BIRC5 is associated with unfavorable overall survival in TN adenocarcinomas. BIRC5 is a potential predictor and therapeutic target in TN adenocarcinomas.",ALK,1

Importance: Data sets linking comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) to clinical outcomes may accelerate precision medicine. Objective: To assess whether a database that combines EHR-derived clinical data with CGP can identify and extend associations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Design, Setting, and Participants: Clinical data from EHRs were linked with CGP results for 28 998 patients from 275 US oncology practices. Among 4064 patients with NSCLC, exploratory associations between tumor genomics and patient characteristics with clinical outcomes were conducted, with data obtained between January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2018. Exposures: Tumor CGP, including presence of a driver alteration (a pathogenic or  likely pathogenic alteration in a gene shown to drive tumor growth); tumor mutation burden (TMB), defined as the number of mutations per megabase; and clinical characteristics gathered from EHRs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival (OS), time receiving therapy, maximal therapy response (as documented by the treating physician in the EHR), and clinical benefit rate (fraction of patients with stable disease, partial response, or complete response) to therapy. Results: Among 4064 patients with NSCLC (median age, 66.0 years; 51.9% female), 3183 (78.3%) had a history of smoking, 3153 (77.6%) had nonsquamous cancer, and 871 (21.4%) had an alteration in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 (701 [17.2%] with EGFR, 128 [3.1%] with ALK, and 42 [1.0%] with ROS1 alterations). There were 1946 deaths in  7 years. For patients with a driver alteration, improved OS was observed among those treated with (n = 575) vs not treated with (n = 560) targeted therapies (median, 18.6 months [95% CI, 15.2-21.7] vs 11.4 months [95% CI, 9.7-12.5] from advanced diagnosis; P < .001). TMB (in mutations/Mb) was significantly higher among smokers vs nonsmokers (8.7 [IQR, 4.4-14.8] vs 2.6 [IQR, 1.7-5.2]; P < .001) and significantly lower among patients with vs without an alteration in EGFR (3.5 [IQR, 1.76-6.1] vs 7.8 [IQR, 3.5-13.9]; P < .001), ALK (2.1 [IQR, 0.9-4.0] vs 7.0 [IQR, 3.5-13.0]; P < .001), RET (4.6 [IQR, 1.7-8.7] vs 7.0 [IQR, 2.6-13.0]; P = .004), or ROS1 (4.0 [IQR, 1.2-9.6] vs 7.0 [IQR, 2.6-13.0]; P = .03). In patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies (n = 1290, 31.7%), TMB of 20 or more was significantly associated with improved OS from therapy initiation (16.8  months [95% CI, 11.6-24.9] vs 8.5 months [95% CI, 7.6-9.7]; P < .001), longer time receiving therapy (7.8 months [95% CI, 5.5-11.1] vs 3.3 months [95% CI, 2.8-3.7]; P < .001), and increased clinical benefit rate (80.7% vs 56.7%; P < .001) vs TMB less than 20. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with NSCLC included in a longitudinal database of clinical data linked to CGP results from routine care, exploratory analyses replicated previously described associations between clinical and genomic characteristics, between driver mutations and response to targeted therapy, and between TMB and response to immunotherapy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of creating a clinicogenomic database derived from routine clinical experience and provide support for further research and discovery evaluating this approach in oncology.",ALK,1

Among 202 cases tested, 107 cases (52.97%) showed EGFR mutations, including 86 of 133 cases (64.66%) of adenocarcinoma and 18 of 52 cases (34.62%) of non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma. Twenty two cases were found to have T790M mutation among 27 patients after EGFR TKI targeted drug therapy. Immunohistochemical staining of ALK (D5F3) was positive in 3 of 354 cases of non-small cell lung cancer, confirmed by EML4-ALK fusion gene fluorescence PCR. ROS1 gene fusion was found in 1 of 38 cases. Splicing mutations in exon 14 of MET gene were seen in one case of non-small cell carcinoma with spindle cell differentiation. Conclusion: The new diagnostic criteria by the 2015 WHO lung tumor classification is better suited for diagnosing lung biopsy specimens and providing accurate treatment guidance and improving the patient outcome.",ALK,1

We performed a comprehensive analysis to compare the diagnostic value of CTCs and ctDNA for gene mutations in lung cancer. Methods: Publications were electronically searched in PubMed, Embase, and Web of  Science as of July 2018. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, each with a 95% CI, were yielded. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.  Quality assessment of included studies was also performed. Results: From 4,283 candidate articles, we identified 47 articles with a total of 7,244 patients for qualitative review and meta-analysis. When detecting EGFR, the CTC and ctDNA groups had pooled sensitivity of 75.4% (95% CI 0.683-0.817) and 67.1% (95% CI 0.647-0.695), respectively. When testing KRAS, pooled sensitivity was 38.7% (95% CI 0.266-0.519) in the CTC group and 65.1% (95% CI 0.558-0.736) in the ctDNA group. The diagnostic performance of ctDNA in testing ALK and BRAF was  also evaluated. Heterogeneity among the 47 articles was acceptable. Conclusion: ctDNA might be a more promising biomarker with equivalent performance to CTCs when detecting EGFR and its detailed subtypes, and superior diagnostic capacity when testing KRAS and ALK. In addition, the diagnostic performance of ctDNA and CTCs depends on the detection methods greatly, and this warrants further studies to explore more sensitive methods.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],The Impact of Brain Metastases and Associated Neurocognitive Aspects on Health Utility Scores in EGFR Mutated and ALK Rearranged NSCLC: A Real World Evidence Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In lung cancer, brain metastases (BM) and their treatment are associated with high economic burden and inferior health-related quality of life. In the era of targeted therapy, real world evidence through health utility scores (HUS) is critical for economic analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective observational cohort study (2014-2016), outpatients with stage IV lung cancer completed demographic and EQ-5D-3L surveys  (to derive HUS). Health states and clinicopathologic variables were obtained from chart abstraction. Patients were categorized by the presence or absence of BM; regression analyses identified factors that were associated with HUS. A subset of patients prospectively completed neurocognitive function (NCF) tests and/or the FACT-brain (FACT-Br) questionnaire, which were then correlated with HUS (Spearman coefficients; regression analyses). RESULTS: Of 519 patients with 1,686 EQ-5D-3L-derived HUS, 94 (18%) completed NCF  tests and 107 (21%) completed FACT-Br; 301 (58%) never developed BM, 24 (5%) developed first BM during study period, and 194 (37%) had BM at study entry. The  sample was enriched (46%) for EGFR mutations (EGFRm) and ALK-rearrangements (ALKr). There were no HUS differences by BM status overall and in subsets by demographics. In multivariable analyses, superior HUS was associated with having  EGFRm/ALKr (p < .0001), no prior radiation for extracranial disease (p < .001), and both intracranial (p = .002) and extracranial disease control (p < .01). HUS  correlated with multiple elements of the FACT-Br and tests of NCF. CONCLUSION: Having BM in lung cancer is not associated with inferior HUS in a population enriched for EGFRm and ALKr. Patients exhibiting disease control and those with oncogene-addicted tumors have superior HUS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the setting of EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a diagnosis of brain metastases no longer consigns the patient to an inferior health state suggesting that new economic analyses in NSCLC are needed in the era of targeted therapies. Additionally, the  EQ-5D questionnaire is associated with measures of health-related quality of life and neurocognitive scores suggesting this tool should be further explored in prospective clinical studies.",ALK,1

A useful technique to screen for these fusions is the detection of native carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) protein by immunohistochemistry; however, the effects of other genetic alterations on C-terminal expression is not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated whether C-terminal expression is specifically elevated by fusion with or without typical genetic alterations of lung cancer. METHODS: In 37 human lung cancer cell lines and four tissue specimens, protein and mRNA levels were measured by capillary western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the median of all 37 cell lines, mRNA levels at the C-terminus of all five of the fusion-positive cell lines tested (three ALK, one RET, and one ROS1) were elevated at least 2000-, 300-, or 2000-fold, respectively, and high C-terminal protein expression was detected. In an ALK fusion-positive tissue specimen, the mRNA and protein levels of C-terminal ALK were also markedly elevated. Meanwhile, in one of 36 RET fusion-negative cell lines, RET mRNA levels at the C-terminus were elevated at least 500-fold compared with the median of all 37 cell lines, and high C-terminal protein expression was  detected despite the absence of RET fusion. CONCLUSIONS: This study of 37 cell lines and four tissue specimens shows the detection of C-terminal ALK or ROS1 proteins could be a comprehensive method to determine ALK or ROS1 fusion, whereas not only the detection of C-terminal RET protein but also other methods would be needed to determine RET fusion.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Feb 18.,miR-100-5p confers resistance to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors Crizotinib and Lorlatinib in EML4-ALK positive NSCLC.,"Lung cancer causes the highest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Resistance to therapy is a major clinical issue contributing to the poor prognosis of lung cancer. In recent years, targeted therapy has become a concept  where subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with genetically altered receptor tyrosine kinases are targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). One  such subgroup harbors a gene fusion of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Although most NSCLC  patients with EML4-ALK fusions initially respond to ALK TKI-therapy they eventually develop resistance. While ALK kinase domain mutations contribute to ALK TKI-refractoriness, they are only present in a fraction of all ALK TKI-resistant tumors. In this study we sought to explore a possible involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in conferring resistance to ALK TKIs in ALK TKI-refractory  NSCLC cell lines. We subjected our ALK TKI-refractory cancer cells along with parental cancer cells to systematic miRNA expression arrays. Furthermore, ALK TKI-refractory cancer cells were exposed to a synthetic miRNA inhibitory Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)-library in the presence of ALK TKIs Crizotinib or Lorlatinib.  The outcome of the combined approaches uncovered miR-100-5p to confer resistance  to Crizotinib and Lorlatinib in EML4-ALK NSCLC cells and to be a potential therapeutic target in drug resistance.",ALK,1

ALK+ tumors have been associated with increased pleural and pericardial disease. Our primary objective  was to determine the uncommon sites of metastasis of ALK+ NSCLC. Secondary objectives included study of coexisting mutations and factors impacting survival  of ALK+ NSCLC. METHODS: All patients with metastatic ALK+ NSCLC at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, California from 2010 to 2017 were selected for retrospective chart review. The demographic variables were collected. The molecular statuses of patients were evaluated through commercially available platforms for next-generation sequencing. Three-dimensional volumetric images were generated for the primary lesion and different sites of metastasis. RESULTS: Sixty two patients with ALK+ NSCLC were identified from 2010 to 2017. The median age was 59 with 36 (58%) female individuals and only 20 (32%) smokers. Twenty four patients had uncommon sites of metastasis which were thyroid, soft tissue, chest and abdominal wall, spleen, peritoneum, omentum, kidney, and ovary. Common characteristics of the primary lesions were right upper lobe location (N=23 [37%]), oval shape (N=22 [35%]), irregular margins (N=26 [42%]), solid lesions (N=27 [44%]), presence of pleural contact or effusion (N=22 [35%]). Twenty four patients had next-generation sequencing testing which showed coexisting mutations such as TP53 (N=8), EGFR (N=5), KRAS (N=3). Patients with uncommon sites of metastasis had a decreased median survival compared with common sites (39 vs. 82 m, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: In NSCLC, ALK rearrangements may not be mutually exclusive mutations  and can present with unique radiographic patterns. Patients with uncommon sites of metastasis may have worse outcomes.",ALK,1

Methods: This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the genomic alterations, treatment and prognosis of young patients under 40 years old from a  cohort of 640 lung adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma cases from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. All patients were examined for EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF and HER2 mutations and ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion genes. Results: In total, 54 patients were aged under 40 years. The frequencies of genomic alterations in younger (≤40 years) and older (>40 years) patients were 68.5% and 54.8%, respectively (P=0.05). Younger patients harbored a higher frequency of fusion genes (22.2% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001) but not gene mutations (46.3% vs. 45.6%, P=0.92). There was a general trend toward shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS) (35.2 vs. 43.8 months, P=0.050), while no overall survival (OS) difference existed between younger and older patients (50.2 vs. 51.4 months, P=0.112).

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), notably antibodies directed against programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have transformed therapeutic standards in thoracic oncology. These ICIs are now the reference second-line treatment and numerous phase III trials have examined their efficacy in treatment-naïve patients. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy was validated for patients with ≥ 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1; pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and nivolumab have obtained good outcomes in combination with chemotherapy or another immunotherapy. However, in this context, other phase III  trials yielded negative findings for nivolumab alone (CheckMate-026) or in combination (MYSTIC trial). Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and the tumor mutation burden (TMB), enable better selection of patients who should benefit the most from first-line ICI use.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Feb 19.,Integrated analysis of the prognostic value of TP53 dependent etoposide-induced gene 24 in non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Etoposide-induced gene 24 (EI24) is an induction target of TP53-mediated apoptosis in human cancer cells. The hypothesis of this study is that EI24 might be a prognostic biomarker of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen gene expression NSCLC datasets with follow-up information (a total of 2582 accessible cases) were collected from Asia, Europe and North America. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses were applied to evaluate the relation between EI24 and the outcomes of NSCLC. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore EI24 and cancer-related gene signatures. RESULTS: EI24 was significantly upregulated in mutated TP53 NSCLC samples and significantly downregulated with the increase in the TP53 expression level in NSCLC. GSEA results suggested that EI24 significantly enriched metastasis and poor prognosis gene signatures. Meanwhile, EI24 was significantly upregulated in  lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal lungs (p < 0.01). It was also highly expressed in the later TNM stages and the ALK fusion+, higher MYC gene copy and EGFR wild type subgroups (p < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that  the expression of EI24 was significantly associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in a dose-dependent manner in GSE31210 dataset. The C-index of Cox model with EI24 is 0.70, that is better than that with MYC (0.51), KRAS (0.51) and EGFR (0.59), which indicates better prognostic performance of EI24. The prognostic significance of EI24 for overall survival of NSCLC was validated by pooled and meta-analysis on 14 datasets. The stratification analysis revealed that EI24 prognosticated poor overall survival (HR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.39-9.62, p < 0.05) in the TP53 wild type subgroup, but not in the mutated  TP53 NSCLC subgroup. Moreover, YY1 might transcriptionally regulate EI24 in a positive manner. CONCLUSION: EI24 is a potential prognostic biomarker and impacts poor outcome in  NSCLC. The prognostic significance of EI24 might rely on TP53 status.",ALK,1

The impact of concomitant TP53 mutations in ALK-rearranged NSCLC remains uncertain. METHODS: Tumor samples from 64 ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients receiving crizotinib treatment were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify TP53 mutational status. The clinicopathologic features of the TP53 mutations and its impact on the effect of crizotinib treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 64 ALK-rearranged patients, 15 (23.4%) patients showed a TP53  mutation. Of these, six cases had disruptive mutations and nine with nondisruptive mutations. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) for TP53 mutated patients were both significantly lower compared with  those for TP53 wild-type patients (p = 0.003 and 0.023, respectively). A significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) was found in TP53 mutated patients compared with TP53 wild-type patients (p = 0.045). Nondisruptive TP53 mutations were associated with a shorter PFS in comparison with disruptive TP53 mutations in ALK-rearranged patients (p = 0.069). When nondisruptive TP53 mutated patients were in comparison with TP53 wild-type patients, nondisruptive TP53 mutations were associated with a significant reduced PFS (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutations, especially nondisruptive mutations, negatively affected the response to crizotinib and correlated with shorter PFS in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients.",ALK,1

Epub  2019 Feb 8.,Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Is a Mechanism of ALK Inhibitor Resistance in Lung Cancer Independent of ALK Mutation Status.,"Mutations in the ALK gene are detectable in approximately 40% of ALK-rearranged lung cancers resistant to ALK inhibitors. Although epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a mechanism of resistance to various targeted drugs, its involvement in ALK inhibitor resistance is largely unknown. In this study, we report that both ALK-mutant L1196M and EMT were concomitantly detected in a single crizotinib-resistant lesion in a patient with ALK-rearranged lung cancer.  Digital PCR analyses combined with microdissection after IHC staining for EMT markers revealed that ALK L1196M was predominantly detected in epithelial-type tumor cells, indicating that mesenchymal phenotype and ALK mutation can coexist as independent mechanisms underlying ALK inhibitor-resistant cancers. Preclinical experiments with crizotinib-resistant lung cancer cells showed that EMT associated with decreased expression of miR-200c and increased expression of ZEB1 caused cross-resistance to new-generation ALK inhibitors alectinib, ceritinib, and lorlatinib. Pretreatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor quisinostat overcame this resistance by reverting EMT in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicate that HDAC inhibitor pretreatment followed by a new ALK inhibitor may be useful to circumvent resistance constituted by coexistence of resistance mutations and EMT in the heterogeneous tumor. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that dual inhibition of HDAC and ALK receptor tyrosine kinase activities provides a means to circumvent crizotinib resistance in lung cancer.",ALK,1

Patients receiving 300 mg twice-daily alectinib (September 2014 to June 2015) were monitored until termination of alectinib or completion of 18 months of treatment at 519 Japanese  study sites. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADR), which are important identified risks for alectinib in Japanese patients. Overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, was assessed according to information on outcome. Overall, 1251 patients were enrolled. The median patient  age was 62.0 years; 12.9% of patients were aged ≥75 years. At baseline, 63.0% of  patients had received crizotinib and 40.6% had brain metastases. Altogether, 1512 ADR occurred in 654 patients (53.6%), with 164 grade ≥3 ADR in 123 patients (10.1%). Commonly occurring ADR were hepatic disorders (all grades, 19.8%; grade  ≥3, 2.0%), decreased neutrophil and/or white blood cell count (all grades, 7.6%;  grade ≥3, 1.1%), and interstitial lung disease (all grades, 3.8%; grade ≥3, .7%). Median OS was not estimable. The 18-month cumulative OS rate was longer in patients with ECOG performance status ≤1 (vs 2 or ≥3; 83.7% vs 44.5% or 27.2%), without prior crizotinib (vs with; 81.1% vs 73.4%), receiving first-line alectinib (vs second and third or later line; 83.0% vs 79.2% or 71.9%), without brain metastases (vs with; 79.5% vs 71.5%).

Despite its initial efficacy, patients ultimately acquire resistance to crizotinib within 1 year. In such patients, the optimal sequential therapy after  crizotinib treatment remains unknown. This study explored which sequential therapy option confers the greatest benefit. Methods: A total of 138 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC resistant to crizotinib were studied. Based on patterns of disease progression of metastases,  patients were divided into 3 groups: brain progression, non-liver progression, and liver progression. Sequential therapies included crizotinib continuation plus local therapy, next-generation ALK inhibitors (ALKi's), and chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) from the time of crizotinib resistance to death or last follow-up. Results: The 138 patients included 64 cases with progression in brain, 57 cases in non-liver sites and 17 cases in liver. A significant difference in OS was observed among the distinct progression pattern (median OS, 25.4 months in brain, 15.8 months in non-liver, and 10.8 months in liver, respectively, P=0.020). The difference in OS among sequential therapies was statistically significant in the on-liver progression group (median OS, 27.6 months with next-generation ALKi's,  13.3 months with crizotinib continuation, and 10.8 months with chemotherapy, respectively, P=0.019). However, crizotinib continuation plus local therapy seems to provide non-inferior median OS compared with next-generation ALKi's for patients with brain progression (median OS, 28.9 months vs. 32.8 months, P=0.204). And no significant differences in OS were found in patients with progression in liver (P=0.061). Conclusions: Crizotinib continuation together with local therapy might be a feasible strategy for patients with progression in brain beyond crizotinib resistance, as well as next-generation ALKi's. Next-generation ALKi's tended to provide a survival benefit in patients with non-liver progression.",ALK,1

A matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was conducted to estimate the relative efficacy of these agents in the crizotinib-refractory setting. METHODS: MAIC is a propensity score-type method that adjusts for differences in baseline characteristics between trials to estimate relative efficacy. Analyses were based on patient-level data from the ALTA trial for brigatinib and published summary-level trial data from ASCEND-1 and ASCEND-2 for ceritinib and NP28761 and NP28673 for alectinib. Objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared. RESULTS: After matching, all key baseline characteristics were balanced between trials. Compared with ceritinib, brigatinib was associated with longer PFS (ASCEND-1: median 15.7 vs 6.9 months, hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval] = 0.38 [0.26-0.57]; ASCEND-2: median = 18.3 vs 7.2 months, HR = 0.33 [0.20-0.56]) and OS (ASCEND-1: not available; ASCEND-2: median 27.6 vs 14.9 months, HR = 0.33 [0.17-0.63]). Versus alectinib, brigatinib was associated with  longer PFS (NP28761: median = 17.6 vs 8.2 months, HR = 0.56 [0.36-0.86]; NP28673: median = 17.6 vs 8.9 months, HR = 0.61 [0.40-0.93]); results for OS were inconclusive (NP28761: median = 27.6 vs 22.7 months, HR = 0.70 [0.42-1.16]; NP28673: median = 27.6 vs 26.0 months, HR = 0.66 [0.39-1.09]). ORR was similar.

METHODS: We retrospectively screened 423 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR 19del or 21L858R mutations. A total of 71 patients whose progression-free survivals (PFS) were shorter than 6 months or longer than 24 months were included and stratified into separate groups. Genetic background discrepancy was analysed in the two groups using next generation sequencing (NGS). FINDINGS: Sensitive EGFR mutations of 19del or 21L858R were detected by NGS in all patients; the 21L858R mutation was the major type. The most frequent accompanying somatic mutations were TP53, RB1, MAP2K. ALK fusion, MET amplification, and BRAF V600E were found only in the short PFS group. Concurrent  pretreament T790 M mutation was found in both groups, but was proportionally higher in the short PFS group. In the short PFS group, patients had significantly more driver gene mutations than in long PFS group (P = 0·018). The numbers of concomitant somatic mutations, EGFR pathway-related mutations, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) were not significantly different between the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Co-occuring driver gene mutations were negative predictive factors of TKI therapy in EGFR-mutated patients. This study highlights the importance of exploring co-occuring genomic alterations before initiation of EGFR-TKIs.",ALK,1

PATIENTS & METHODS: Adverse events associated with cardiac failure were compared  between treatment arms in each study separately. Cardiac function was assessed prospectively by multigated acquisition scans or echocardiograms. RESULTS: In PROFILE 1007 and 1014, incidence of cardiac failure adverse events was 0% (crizotinib) versus 0.6% (chemotherapy) and 2.3% versus 0.6%, respectively. In crizotinib versus chemotherapy arms, respectively, >20% left ventricular ejection fraction decreases occurred in 0/19 (0%) versus 1/16 (6.3%)  patients from PROFILE 1007 and 4/150 (2.7%) versus 10/150 (6.7%) patients from PROFILE 1014. CONCLUSION: These analyses did not reveal any clinically meaningful changes in myocardial function with crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell  lung cancer.

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,Immunohisto(cyto)chemistry: an old time classic tool driving modern oncological therapies.,"In the era of precision medicine immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) share some of the highlights in personalized treatment. Survival data obtained from clinical trials shape the cut-offs and IHC scoring that serve as recommendations for patient selection both for targeted and conventional therapies. Assessment of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors along with HER2 status has been among the first approved immunostaining assays revolutionizing breast cancer treatment. Similarly, ALK positivity predicts the efficacy of ALK inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In recent years, Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC assays have been approved  as companion or complimentary diagnostic tools predicting the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have inaugurated a new period in the treatment of advanced cancers, but the path to approval of these biomarkers is filled with immunohistochemical challenges. The latter brings to the fore the significance of molecular pathology as a hub between basic and clinical research. Besides, novel markers are translated into routine practice, suggesting that we are at the beginning of a new exciting period. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular homeostasis unfolds biomarkers with greater specificity and sensitivity. The introduction of  GL13 (SenTraGor®) for the detection of senescent cells in archival material, the  implementation of key players of stress response pathways and the development of  compounds detecting common mutant P53 isoforms in dictating oncological treatments are paradigms for precision oncology.",ALK,1

However, in cases of recurrence or unresectable tumors, no standard care exists. While crizotinib, an anaplastic lymphoma kinase  (ALK) inhibitor, is only approved for non-small-cell lung cancer with ALK mutation, it is reportedly effective for other malignant tumors with ALK mutation. We herein report a case involving a 37-year-old woman with retroperitoneal IMT with ALK mutation, who experienced recurrence after complete  resection, in whom crizotinib treatment resulted in complete response. ALK-inhibitor efficacy against malignancies with ALK mutations should be investigated in future.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Aug 1.,Sarcoid-like reaction mimicking disease progression in an ALK-positive lung cancer patient receiving lorlatinib.,"The administration of target inhibitors is paramount to grant the longest survival in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The eventual resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is monitored clinically and radiologically for prompt molecule shift to further generation TKI, if available. However, the early radiological detection of progression pattern (e.g. nodule onset) should be regarded with caution because overlaps exist with non-tumor cell proliferation and/or accumulation. Here we report the case of a stage IV ALK-rearranged NSCLC patient exposed to serial crizotinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, and lorlatinib (this latter brought to complete brain and leptomeningeal disease response), in a period of more than five years. During lorlatinib, the appearance of solid pulmonary nodules was obviously interpreted as disease progression. However, surgical biopsies of the pulmonary nodules revealed features of sarcoid-like granulomatous lymphadenitis, namely without tumor cell. This invasive approach, besides documenting for the first time a sarcoid-like reaction to ALK inhibitors, allowed to revert the radiological diagnosis and maintain lorlatinib, for the best patient outcome. The pragmatic relevance of these findings suggests a careful attitude towards the interpretation of radiologic patterns of disease progression in patients under TKI.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Staging of nutrition disorders in non-small-cell lung cancer patients: utility of skeletal muscle mass assessment.,"BACKGROUND: An international consensus proposed in 2011 a definition and classification system for cachexia (CAX), mainly based on weight loss, sarcopenia [skeletal muscle mass (SMM) loss], inflammation, and anorexia. The aim of this study was to stage CAX in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by using a  classification based on the Fearon criteria and supported by quantifiable parameters. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional and non-interventional multicentre study. SMM was assessed by analysing L3 computed tomography-scan images. Patients completed  the anorexia/CAX subscale of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy, EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life (QoL) and International Physical Activity  Questionnaire (IPAQ). RESULTS: Patients were recruited in 56 sites. The analysis population comprised 531 patients, and SMM was assessed in 312 patients. Male patients were 66.5%, with a mean (SD) age of 65.2 (10.0) years, 79.9% were PS 0-1, and the tumour stage was mainly IIIB-IV (87.3%). Overall, 38.7% of patients had CAX, 33.8% pre-CAX, and 0.9% refractory CAX. Molecular tumour profiles were significantly associated with the presence of CAX: 23.9% in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, or HER2+ patients, 41.4% in K-RAS+, and 43.2% in patients with no molecular abnormality (P = 0.003). The more advanced the CAX stage, the poorer the scores of functional items of the QoL (P < 0.001) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (P < 0.001). Sarcopenia was present in 66.7% of CAX and 68.5% of pre-CAX patients. Overall, 43.8% of pre-CAX patients had only sarcopenia with limited weight loss (≤2%) and no anorexia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show the distribution of CAX in a population of NSCLC patients and an association between molecular abnormality in  NSCLC and CAX. The original Fearon classification for CAX stages was supported by the associated functional QoL scores and physical activity levels, resulting in a clinically relevant system for detection of early stages of CAX.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Feb 27.,Aggregate analysis based on TCGA: TTN missense mutation correlates with favorable prognosis in lung squamous cell carcinoma.,"PURPOSE: Lung cancer prevalence with its high mortality rate is a trending topic  globally. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. The human gene TTN encoding for TITIN protein is known as major mutation  gene in many types of tumor including NSCLC. However, it is still controversial that TTN is a cancer-associated candidate considering tumor heterogeneity and complex genetic structure. In-depth researches on correlation between TTN mutation and NSCLC are still limited and discussable. METHODS: Related somatic mutation profiles and attached clinical data were from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung project. Clinical relevance analysis of TTN mutation was evaluated using univariate analysis and a binary logistic regressive model. Survival analysis and screening of independent prognostic factors in mutation types were conducted by Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: Available data covering lung adenocarcinoma (n = 517) and lung squamous  cell carcinoma (n = 492) were analyzed. TTN genetic mutations exhibited significant association with lung squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma possessed favorable overall survival benefits from TTN mutant type and both favorable overall survival and disease-free survival benefits from TTN/TP53 double mutation. For patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, about 85% of subjects with TTN mutation harbored missense variations,  which was an independent indicator of good prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Missense mutation of TTN may act as a beneficial role in lung squamous cell carcinoma, but not in lung adenocarcinoma.",ALK,1

Unfortunately, most patients of LC present at the advanced stage of the disease with a poor prognosis and 1-year survival of less than 20%. At the advanced stage of the disease, surgical resection cannot be possible, hence small biopsy or cytology specimens remain a choice for their correct diagnosis. The recognition of molecular drivers has revolutionized the treatment paradigm of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations were identified, first, to be targeted in NSCLC followed by activating fusions in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and rearrangements in c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) genes. In addition, the encouraging progress of immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC has been associated  with predictive biomarker testing in the form of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry assay. To test for these alterations, accurate biomarker testing is needed from biopsy or cytology specimens. In this brief review, testing of biomarkers is discussed using cytology specimens.",ALK,1

This report describes the clinical course of a female former light smoker with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma whose tumor underwent histologic transformation from a well-differentiated lung adenocarcinoma to a well-differentiated lung squamous cell carcinoma in the same location at the left mainstem bronchus while  maintaining the ALK fusion oncogene without any resistance mutations. After experiencing disease progression while on crizotinib, the patient participated in clinical trials that provided early access to the novel ALK inhibitors ceritinib  and alectinib before they were commercially available. Tumor recurrence occurred  at the primary and metastatic central nervous system sites (ie, brain and spine). At tumor progression, liquid biopsy and tumor genomic profiling of plasma cell-free DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) provided an accurate diagnosis with a short turnaround time compared with the tissue-based targeted capture NGS. The patient received several courses of radiation primarily to the brain and spine during her disease course. Her disease did not respond to the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, and she died on home hospice approximately 4 years after diagnosis. This case supports the importance of both histopathologic  assessment and comprehensive genomic profiling in selecting appropriate treatment for patients with refractory, metastatic, ALK oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer. Use of symptom-directed radiation in tandem with ALK inhibitors contributed to the disease and symptomatic control and prolonged survival in this patient.",ALK,1

Epub  2018 Jan 22.,Crizotinib-induced erosive esophagitis in a pediatric patient with neuroblastoma.,"Crizotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, approved by the FDA in 2011, for use in anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive, metastatic, non-small cell lung cancer. Crizotinib inhibits oncogenic protein expression and impairs cellular proliferation in tumors with an overexpressed anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene. Currently used most frequently in the adult patient population, pediatric use is  becoming more prominent, specifically in disease states exhibiting anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive, metastatic disease, such as neuroblastoma. Approximately 8% of neuroblastomas have activating anaplastic lymphoma kinase-mutations, making this a promising target for a difficult-to-treat disease. Studies in the pediatric population are limited. However, targeted anaplastic lymphoma kinase-inhibitor therapies have shown improved outcomes at both one-year and two-year marks in both overall survival and progression free survival in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer. One Children's Oncology Group phase I trial examined toxicities associated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor therapy in pediatric patients. Results revealed varying grades in severity of neutropenia, dizziness,  and liver function test elevation. In the adult population, severe toxicities reported by the manufacturer include effects on liver, cardiac and lung function. Additionally, several cases of severe, erosive, pill-esophagitis due to crizotinib therapy have been documented in the adult population. Erosive esophagitis is common in the pediatric population due to a variety of factors. Ingestion of medications or other corrosive agents accounts for approximately 3-5% (5000-10,000 cases per year) of esophagitis presentation in the pediatric population. Common causative medications include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, antibiotics such as doxycycline and tetracycline, and ferrous sulfate. Presented here is the first reported case of crizotinib-induced pill esophagitis  in a pediatric patient.",ALK,1

Newer anti-ALK treatments have demonstrated far greater intracranial efficacy. Here we performed a meta-analysis with the aim of assessing the efficacy of ALK inhibitors on BMs. Methods: A search of published trials was conducted in PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase. Data were pooled using the number of events/number of evaluable patients (non-small cell lung cancer patients with BMs) according to fixed or random effect models. Intracranial efficacy was assessed through overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and median progression-free survival (PFS). Subgroup analyses for baseline BMs, previous treatment with ALK inhibitor, study type, and current ALK inhibitor were made. Results: Twenty studies accounting for 2,715 patients were included. The pooled iORR was 48% (95% CI: 32-63%) in fifteen single-arm studies. The overall DCR was  65% (95% CI: 60-69%) from three studies include available data. The iORR was 79%  (95% CI: 64-91%), 45% (24-67%), 48% (34-63%), 18% (13-24%) in patients receiving  alectinib, ceritinib, brigatinib, and crizotinib, respectively. Five randomized studies assessed the intracranial efficacy of anti-ALK agents versus chemotherapy, the pooled RR for iORR was 3.54 (95% CI: 2.38-5.26), and the pooled HR for iPFS was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.36-0.75; P=0.71) estimated in 2 studies. Conclusions: Despite the limitation from lack of published clinical data, our results showed that ALK inhibitors are effective at the brain site regardless of  previous anti-ALK treatments, systemic therapy with ALK inhibitors should be considered as a preferred approach over for controlling BMs from ALK-positive NSCLC.",ALK,1

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. Methods: We analyzed the clinicopathological data of 44 cases of advanced NSCLC targeted with ICIs in our hospital, between February 2016 and February 2018, in order to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. We also reviewed the literature regarding ICIs. Result: We retrospectively analyzed the 44 cases (26 nivolumab and 18 pembrolizumab cases). These patients were 38 men and 6 women, comprising 13 cases of adenocarcinoma, 29 squamous cell carcinoma and 2 unclassified types. Seven patients were using first-line therapy and while the others were using second-line therapy or later. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations were negative in all the cases. The response rate and disease control rate were 20.5% and 51.3%, respectively. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 146 days  and 257 days, respectively. We observed five severe adverse effects (AEs) (three  cases of interstitial pneumonia, one of liver dysfunction and one of adrenal failure), that were resolved by steroid pulse therapy. In multivariate analyses,  the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), pathological type, standardized uptake value (SUV) on positron emission tomography (PET), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin were independently prognostic factors. There were no significant differences in the prognosis between nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Conclusions: ICIs were effective in 44 treated NSCLC cases. Our analysis suggests that while ICIs are effective in treating patients, candidates must be carefully  selected and cautiously observed.",ALK,1

METHODS: Patients with stage IV NSCLC treated with an ALK inhibitor at the University of Colorado Cancer Center from 2009 through November 2017 were identified retrospectively. OS curves were constructed by using Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the  relationship of variables with OS. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were identified, 105 received crizotinib as their initial ALK inhibitor. With a median follow-up time  of 47 months, the median OS time from diagnosis of stage IV disease was 81 months (6.8 years). Brain metastases at diagnosis of stage IV disease (hazard ratio = 1.01, p = 0.971) and year of stage IV presentation (p = 0.887) did not influence  OS. More organs with tumor at diagnosis of stage IV disease was associated withorse OS (HR = 1.49 for each additional organ with disease, including the CNS [p = 0.002]). Each additional month of pemetrexed-based therapy was associated with a 7% relative decrease in risk of death. CONCLUSION: Patients with stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC can have prolonged OS. Brain metastases at diagnosis of stage IV disease does not influence OS. Having more organs involved with tumor at stage IV presentation is associated with worse outcomes. Prolonged benefit from pemetrexed is associated with better outcomes.",ALK,1

METHODS: Venous and arterial TEEs within ±365 days of diagnosis of ROS1+, ALK+, EGFR+, or KRAS+ advanced NSCLC at five academic centers in the United States and  China were captured (October 2002-April 2018). The primary endpoint was incidence of TEE in ROS1+ compared to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)+, EGFR+, and KRAS+ NSCLC within ±90 days of diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to assess if the odds of TEE differed among oncogene drivers. RESULTS: Eligible data from 95 ROS1+, 193 ALK+, 300 EGFR+, and 152 KRAS+ NSCLC patients were analyzed. The incidence rate of TEE was 34.7% (n = 33), 22.3% (n =  43), 13.7% (n = 41), and 18.4% (n = 28), respectively. In univariate analysis, the odds of a TEE in ROS1+ NSCLC were higher than ALK+, EGFR+, and KRAS+ cohorts. In multivariable analysis, the odds of a TEE were significantly higher for ROS1+  compared to EGFR+ and KRAS+ cohorts, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.44, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.31-4.57 (p = 0.005), and OR: 2.62, with a 95% confidence interval of 1.26-5.46 (p = 0.01), respectively. Although numerically superior, the odds for a TEE with ROS1+ compared to ALK+ was not statistically significant  (OR: 1.45, p = 0.229). Overall survival was not significantly different in patients with or without TEE within ±90 days of diagnosis in the overall study cohort or within each molecular group. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of peridiagnostic TEEs is significantly elevated in patients with advanced ROS+ NSCLC compared to EGFR+ and KRAS+ cases. TEE risk may be similarly elevated in ALK+ NSCLC.",ALK,1

METHODS: Post-marketing surveillance was performed in Japan to obtain information on the safety and efficacy of crizotinib. Target patients included all patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive NSCLC who received crizotinib during the enrollment period between May 2012 and December 2014. The observation period was  52 weeks. Expert analysis of the ILD incidence was performed by an ILD independent review committee composed of five medical specialists. RESULTS: The safety analysis set included 2028 patients, and more than half of the patients (56.4%) were nonsmokers. The incidence of ILD associated with crizotinib therapy was 5.77%; and 3.45% patients showed grade 3 or greater. Pulmonary edema-like shadows with or without diffuse alveolar damage pattern were observed in crizotinib-associated ILD (incidence: 0.39%), but a causal relationship with the prognosis could not be identified. ILD developed within 4 weeks from initiation of crizotinib administration in 41.9% and within 8 weeks in 69.2% of the patients. Age 55 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  performance status 2-4, smoking history, previous or concomitant ILD, and comorbid pleural effusion were statistically determined as significant risk factors for crizotinib-induced ILD. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib therapy should be applied to the NSCLC patients with any  of above risk factors under a cautious monitoring for ILD occurrence, and clinicians should pay attention to the risks of severe ILD.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Nov 5.,Neoadjuvant Crizotinib in Resectable Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer  with ALK Rearrangement.,"BACKGROUND: Locally advanced NSCLC is one of the most heterogeneous conditions, with multidimensional treatments involved. Neoadjuvant therapy had been commonly  considered an optimal management strategy for patients with operable locally advanced. However, as targeted therapy has been widely applied in advanced NSCLC, neoadjuvant targeted therapy has remained poorly explored in locally advanced disease. METHODS: We have described 11 ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK)-positive patients with pathologically confirmed N2 NSCLC who were treated with neoadjuvant crizotinib. All the patients were treatment naive and received crizotinib at a starting dose of 250 mg twice daily. Patient 3 was provided with dynamic monitoring before and after neoadjuvant therapy through next-generation sequencing of plasma and tissue. In case 4, next-generation sequencing of preoperative tissue was performed. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, 10 had a partial response and one was stable disease after neoadjuvant crizotinib, with one suffering from grade 4 hepatic damage. Of  the 11 patients, 10 (91.0%) received an R0 resection and 2 patients achieved a pathological complete response to neoadjuvant crizotinib. Six patients had disease recurrence, with five of them receiving crizotinib as first-line treatment and achieving a long duration of response. Dynamic monitoring of both plasma and tissue simultaneously indicated a decrease in sensitive ALK signaling  in patient 3 and a partial response (approximately 50% of partial response), and  no ALK-dependent resistance variants were captured. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant crizotinib may be feasible and well tolerated in locally  advanced disease for complete resection. Crizotinib therapy before surgery may provide thorough elimination of circulating molecular residual disease and not influence the reuse of first-line crizotinib, but ongoing prospective trials are  warranted to prove its efficacy in the neoadjuvant setting.",ALK,1

Positron emission tomography  (PET)-CT showed enlargement of bilateral cervical, left supraclavicular and multiple mediastinal lymph nodes. PET-CT also showed stripe in the left upper lobe. Adenocarcinoma cells were found from biopsy on her left supraclavicular lymph nodes. We detected cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from peripheral  blood and identified a MET Y1003S mutation by next generation sequencing technology. Y1003 mutations predicted to be similar to MET exon 14 skipping in functionality based on the literature. After an extensive discussion of treatment options, the patient opted to treatment with crizotinib, a small-molecule dual inhibitor of the MET and ALK. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Dramatic response was observed within 1 months of treatment, which lasted more than 10 months. Chest CT scans revealed significant  improvement of the lung focus and decrease in size of the lymph nodes lesions, meeting RECIST partial response criteria (-30%). Y1003 alterations may be diverse mutations and sensitive to MET inhibitors.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Dec 17.,Pembrolizumab in combination with ipilimumab as second-line or later therapy for  advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: KEYNOTE-021 cohorts D and H.,"OBJECTIVES: Combination immunotherapy may result in improved antitumor activity compared with single-agent treatment. We report results from dose-finding and dose-expansion cohorts of the phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-021 study that evaluated combination therapy with anti‒programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab plus anti‒cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab in patients with previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria stipulated histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC and treatment failure on ≥1 prior systemic therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted therapy for patients with EGFR/ALK aberrations). In the dose-finding cohort, patients initially received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 or 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy for up to 2 years. Based on emerging published data, subsequent patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. Objective response rate (ORR; primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded, independent central review. Phase 2 hypothesis that ORR would be greater than the 20% rate for historical controls was evaluated using the exact binomial test. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 71% received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at any dose level. Among patients who received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 44), ORR was 30%  (95% CI, 17%-45%), but not statistically significantly >20% (P = 0.0858). Median  progression-free survival in this group was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.4-5.8) months; median  overall survival was 10.9 (95% CI, 6.1-23.7) months. With pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, incidences of treatment-related adverse events, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events, and immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions were 64%, 29%, and 42%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC, pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab showed evidence of antitumor activity, but was associated with meaningful toxicity.",ALK,1

Epub 2019  Feb 22.,"CNS metastasis in ROS1+ NSCLC: An urgent call to action, to understand, and to overcome.","The incidence of CNS metastasis at the time of diagnosis of and during the natural disease history of advanced ROS1+ NSCLC is largely unknown. It is generally believed that the incidence of CNS metastasis is lower in ROS1+ NSCLC than ALK+ NSCLC as ROS1 fusions are regarded as a less powerful driver mutation than ALK fusions in ALK+ NSCLC based on the longer progression-free survival of ROS1+ NSCLC patients than ALK+ NSCLC patients treated with crizotinib. Here we reviewed the incidence of CNS metastasis from prospective clinical trials and retrospective case series from primarily single institution. The incidence of CNS metastasis in ROS1+ NSCLC patients at the time of diagnosis ranged from 20% to mid 30% while the incidence of CNS metastasis can be as high as in the mid 50% range post-crizotinib indicating CNS metastasis is indeed a major morbidity for ROS1+ NSCLC patients throughout the course of treatment. To date 22 fusion partners in ROS1+ NSCLC have been reported in the literature and one report has indicated CD74-ROS1 fusion variant increased the predilection for CNS metastasis  than non-CD74-ROS1 fusion variants. We reviewed reported intra-cranial activity of all preclinical and clinical development stage ROS1 TKIs and pemetrexed-based  chemotherapy in ROS1+ NSCLC patients. While several ROS1 TKIs (i.e. entrectinib,  cabozantinib, lorlatinib, repotrectinib) have reported intra-cranial response rates, there is no literature reporting on the intra-cranial activity of pemetrexed-based chemotherapy in ROS1+ NSCLC patients. In summary, better understanding the high incidence of CNS metastasis in ROS1+ NSCLC patients, how certain ROS1 fusion variant may increase the incidence of CNS metastasis, and any intra-cranial efficacy data of pemetrexed in ROS1+ NSCLC are all urgently needed.",ALK,1

However, whether a similar conclusion can be applied to lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LSCC) has remained unclear. We therefore evaluated  the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) status and the therapeutic effect of an ALK  tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in IHC- or FISH-positive LSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2403 LSCC patients from three institutions were screened for ALK aberration by IHC. All IHC-positive cases were subjected to FISH (with an approximately equal number of negative cases as a control group) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Clinical efficacy was evaluated for the patients who received TKI therapy. RESULTS: In 2403 cases of LSCC, 37 cases were identified as ALK-positive by IHC.  After quality control, 28 cases were succeeded by FISH (six with insufficient tissue, three with lack of signals) and 13 by NGS (24 failed due to insufficient  samples or poor DNA quality); the percentage of non-diagnostic tests was 24.3% (9/37) and 64.9% (24/37), respectively. Four cases (4/2394, 0.17%) analyzed by FISH were determined as ALK-positive. For the control group (40 ALK IHC), FISH demonstrated no samples with ALK gene fusion. The concordance between ALK IHC- and ALK FISH-positive results was 14.3% (4/28). In the 13 cases studied by NGS, two cases showed ALK-EML4 fusion (consistent with two FISH-positive results), and two cases were interpreted as harboring an ALK-association gene mutation. Among four patients (two FISH-positive and two IHC-positive only cases) receiving TKI therapy, two patients had stable disease and the other two had progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: The positive concordance rate of ALK IHC and FISH in LSCC is far less than that reported for LADC. Therefore, ALK IHC detection in LSCC cannot be  used as a diagnostic method for ALK rearrangement.",ALK,1

Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression may serve as a predictive marker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The relationship between non-small cell lung cancer PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics remains unclear and there is no population level Australian data. We report the results of PD-L1 testing in patients with non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed at major Western Australian public hospitals served by a single  state Pathology provider. We analyzed PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 241 non-small cell lung cancer specimens using the 22C3 clone on a Dako autostainer platform. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was scored as Tumor Proportion  Score and categorized using pre-specified subsets of  1%, 1-49% and  ≥  50% for correlation with clinicopathologic features. PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was  1% in 65 (27%) cases, 1-49% in 100 (41%) cases and  ≥  50% in 76 (32%) cases. PD-L1-positive rate was 92% in squamous cell carcinomas and 67% in adenocarcinomas. PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was higher in squamous cell carcinomas (p  =  0.004) and lower in adenocarcinomas (p  =  0.003). Of the 196 non-squamous carcinomas, 35% had rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) mutations, 13% had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, 2% had anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations and 2% had ROS1 translocations. Tumor Proportion Score  ≥  50% was seen in 34% (23/68), 28% (7/25) and 25% (1/4)  of RAS, EGFR mutant, and ALK translocated carcinomas, respectively. There was no  significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and molecular or genetic abnormalities, or other parameters including age, gender, stage, and smoking status. In our patient cohort, PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas and lower in adenocarcinomas. The overall prevalence of Tumor Proportion Score  ≥  50% is consistent with that reported in  clinical trials.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Feb 20.,The future of lung cancer therapy: Striding beyond conventional EGFR and ALK treatments.,"Lung cancer, one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide has long relied on testing for the molecular biomarkers EGFR/ALK. However, achieving superior clinical outcomes for patients with lung cancer requires developing comprehensive techniques beyond contemporary EGFR/ALK testing. Current technologies are on par with molecular testing for EGFR/ALK in terms of efficacy, most of them failing to offer improvements perhaps primarily due to skepticism among clinicians, despite being recommended in the NCCN guidelines. The present study endeavored to minimize chemotherapy-dependence in EGFR/ALK-negative patient cohorts, and use evidence-based methods to identify ways to improve clinical outcomes. In total, 137 lung cancer cases obtained from 'PositiveSelect NGS data', comprising 91 males and 46 females, were investigated. EGFR- and ALK-positivity was used for data dichotomization to understand the therapeutic utility of rare gene alterations beyond just EGFR/ALK. Statistics obtained from PositiveSelect were collated with data from international studies to construct a  meta-analysis intended to achieve better clinical outcomes. Upon dichotomization, 23% of cases harbored EGFR variants indicating that treating with EGFR TKIs would be beneficial; the remaining 77% exhibited no EGFR variants that would indicate favorable results using specific currently available chemotherapy practices. Similarly, 28% of cases had EGFR+ALK variants favoring EGFR/ALK-based targeted therapeutics; the remaining 72% harbored no EGFR/ALK variants with known beneficial chemotherapy routes. The present study aimed to overcome current inadequacies of targeted therapies in patients with a conventional EGFR/ALK-positive diagnosis and those in EGFR+ALK-negative cohorts. Upon analysis of the negative cohorts, significant and clinically relevant single nucleotide variants were identified in KRAS, ERBB2, MET and RET, with frequencies of 7, 1, 2 and 3% in patients who were EGFR-negative and 6, 1, 1, and 3% in patients who were EGFR and ALK-negative, respectively, enabling the use of targeted therapeutics aside from EGFR/ALK TKIs. From the results of the current study only 35% of the two negative arms (EGFR negative and EGFR+ALK negative) would be recommended NCCN or off-label chemotherapy; prior to the current study, the entire cohorts would have been recommended this treatment. The present study emphasizes the potential of comprehensive genomics in identifying hallmarks of lung cancer beyond EGFR/ALK, using broad-spectrum genetic testing and data-sharing among medical professionals to circumvent ineffective chemotherapy.",ALK,1

Major progress in terms of systemic treatments has been achieved in recent decades. Access to new anti-PD-(L) 1 immunotherapies and targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oncogenic addiction such as EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement have led to improved outcomes. Patients with limited progression of their disease during systemic treatment may be a particular subgroup. This oligoprogressive state is characterized by a limited number of sites in progression, implying that the other sites remain controlled and therefore sensitive to systemic treatments. The advent of non-invasive techniques such as stereotactic radiotherapy, radiofrequency, and mini-invasive surgery has led to a precise re-evaluation of local ablative treatments in this situation. Local treatment of the oligoprogressive lesion(s) may allow modification of the natural history of the disease, maintenance of effective systemic targeted treatment and, ultimately, to improved survival. Data validating an aggressive local therapeutic approach in oligoprogressive NSCLC patients are currently limited and essentially retrospective. Several international trials are underway that could confirm the clinical benefit of radical local treatment in oligoprogressive advanced NSCLC patients.",ALK,1

Crizotinib, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treating ALK-rearranged NSCLC, has shown remarkable response in ALK-positive NSCLC. However, heterogeneity of clinical responses exists among different ALK fusion partners. Several small studies have investigated the correlation between fusion  partners and efficacy, but not yielded consistent results. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the prevalence of ALK rearrangements in a Chinese NSCLC population, and correlated clinical outcomes of crizotinib with different ALK partners/variants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed genomic profiling and clinical  data of 110 ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients from five centers. The clinical response to crizotinib and survival data in ALK-positive patients was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 134 ALK rearrangements with 39 partners were identified in 110 patients (5.6%) among a cohort of 1971 NSCLC patients. The most frequently occurring ALK fusion partner was EML4, which was identified in 71.6% (96/134) of ll of the rearrangements in 87.3% (96/110) patients, and with variant 3 (41/96,  42.7%) as the main variant type. No statistically significant differences in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were found between EML4-ALK and non-EML4-ALK NSCLC patients in our cohort (PFS, p = 0.207; OS, p = 0.678). Outcomes did not differ significantly between patients above and  below 40 years of age (PFS, p = 0.427; OS, p = 0.686), nor between patients treated with crizotinib in different lines of therapy (PFS, p = 0.171; OS, p = 0.922). For EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC (n = 96), patients harboring variant 3 or variant 5 displayed significantly lower PFS and OS than those with other variants (PFS, 8.6 vs. 11.3 months, p = 0.046; OS, 31.0 vs. 37.6 months, p = 0.026). In addition, patients with a single EML4-ALK rearrangement event displayed favorable PFS (10.0 vs. 7.2 months, p = 0.040) and OS (36.0 vs. 20.0 months, p = 0.029) compared to those harboring multiple ALK rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the patterns of ALK fusion variants present in Chinese NSCLC patients and might help explain heterogeneous clinical outcomes  to crizotinib treatment according to different ALK fusion variants.",ALK,1

The efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the ALK-specific TKI crizotinib in these patients has not been well-established. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of targeted therapies in these patients compared with patients with EGFR or ALK alterations alone. METHODS: Patients were screened for EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement at the Shanghai Chest Hospital (2011-2017). Progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and overall survival (OS) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 5816 patients were screened, and 26 patients were identified  as having concomitant EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements; 22 patients were eligible for survival analysis. Additionally, 95 EGFR-mutant patients and 60 ALK-rearranged patients were randomly selected for analysis. The ORR to EGFR TKIs was 63.2% (12/19) for EGFR/ALK co-altered patients and 62.1% (59/95) for EGFR-mutant patients (p = 0.93) with a median PFS of 10.3 and 11.4 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-1.57; p = 0.87). The ORR to crizotinib was 66.7% (8/12) for double-positive patients and 65.0% (39/60) for ALK-rearranged patients (p = 1.00), with a median PFS of 11.1 and 12.5 months, respectively (HR 1.39; 95% CI 0.69-2.80; p = 0.28). OS was  27.1, 36.2, and 36.8 months for EGFR-mutant, ALK-rearranged, and EGFR/ALK o-altered patients, respectively, and the EGFR/ALK co-existing subgroup tended to have a longer survival period than EGFR-mutant cohorts, though no statistical difference was found (p = 0.12). The median PFS of crizotinib as a sequential therapy after failure of EGFR TKIs was 15.0 months, which exhibited no statistically significant difference compared with the median PFS of ALK-altered  patients who received crizotinib (p = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Both first-generation EGFR TKIs and the ALK TKI crizotinib were effective in these patients. Sequential treatment with EGFR TKIs and crizotinib should be considered as a management option.",ALK,1

METHODS: We enrolled 201 patients with primary NSCLC who had undergone molecular  testing for both ALK gene rearrangement and EGFR mutation. The clinical features  and CT findings of the main lesion and associated pulmonary abnormalities were investigated. RESULTS: Female gender (P = 0.0043 vs. non-ALK/EGFR), young age (P = 0.0156 vs. EGFR), and a light or never smoking history (P = 0.0039 vs. non-ALK/EGFR) were significant clinical characteristics of NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement. The significant CT characteristics compared to NSCLC with EGFR mutation were a large  mass (P = 0.0155), solid mass (P = 0.0048), and no air bronchogram (P = 0.0148).  A central location (P = 0.0322) and lymphadenopathy (P = 0.0353) were also more frequently observed. Coexisting emphysema was significantly less frequent in NSCLC patients with ALK gene rearrangement (P = 0.0135) than non-ALK/EGFR. CONCLUSIONS: NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement was more likely to develop in younger women with a light or never smoking history. The characteristic CT findings of NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement were a large solid mass, less air bronchogram, a central location, and lymphadenopathy.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Feb 18.,Lung cancer family history and exposure to occupational/domestic coal combustion  contribute to variations in clinicopathologic features and gene fusion patterns in non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development  of cancer and its mutant spectrum. Lung cancer has familial aggregation. Lung cancer caused by non-tobacco factors has unique pathological and molecular characteristics. The interaction between genetic lung cancer susceptibility and carcinogens from coal burning remains complex and understudied. METHODS: We selected 410 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a family history of lung cancer (FLC) and exposure to coal combustion between 2014  and 2017. Clinicopathologic parameters were analyzed. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed to detect ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 rearrangement. RESULTS: Among the 410 NSCLC patients, 192 had FLC and 204 (49.8%) were exposed to occupational or domestic coal combustion. FLC patients had the same characteristics regardless of gender and coal exposure: younger age, high female  ratio, adenocarcinoma, increased metastasis, later stage at diagnosis, and higher frequency of gene fusion. Sixty-seven patients (16.3%) had gene rearrangement: 51 (12.4%) harbored EML4-ALK fusions and 16 ROS1 fusions (3.9%). The highest gene fusion rate (35.1%, 33/94) occurred in patients with both FLC and high tobacco and coal exposure. ALK fusions and total gene rearrangement were closely associated with women, never smokers, younger age, FLC, and coal exposure. CONCLUSION: FLC and exposure to coal combustion have an important impact on the clinicopathological characteristics and gene fusion mode of NSCLC, particularly in cases of higher levels of carcinogens, and genetic susceptibility has a greater impact. Our findings may help evaluate the effect of FLC and coal exposure on the pathogenesis of lung cancer.",ALK,1

Methods: We reviewed patients who presented with ALK rearrangements (n=411) or KRAS-mutations (n=122) between September 2010 and January 2018. The clinical characteristics and overall survival were analyzed for the two genotype cohorts and stratified by different age categories (<40, 40-49, 50-59, ≥60 years). Results: In the ALK-positive cohort, the younger group showed more frequent disease in the T3/4 stage (P=0.014), lymph node metastasis (P=0.011) and distant  metastasis (P=0.015) than the older groups. Meanwhile, the mean age at diagnosis  for the ALK-positive patients showed a significant inverse correlation with the clinical stages (stage I/II vs. III vs. IV, 54.7 vs. 52.0 vs. 49.7 years; P<0.001), as well as with the T, N, and M categories. However, KRAS-mutant patients did not exhibit similar relationships to those observed in ALK-positive  patients. Importantly, for ALK-positive patients, the frequency of stage IIIb-IV  disease was almost twice that of stage I-IIIa disease (6.1% vs. 3.4%, P<0.001); there was a similar incidence of the different disease stages in KRAS-mutant lung cancer (P=0.924). Lastly, in ALK-positive patients, the ≥60 years group was associated with a trend toward better survival than the other younger groups. Conclusions: The TNM stages exhibited a significant inverse correlation with age  at diagnosis for ALK-positive lung cancer patients. More unique therapeutic strategies should be required in these young patients.",ALK,1

Combining these immunotherapies with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment has resulted in improved response rates and increased survival when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Certain patient populations may even benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in the first-line setting. The PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is approved as monotherapy or in combination with platinum + pemetrexed for most newly diagnosed patients with metastatic NSCLC, excluding those with a targetable oncogene such as ALK and EGFR. The PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab is also approved in combination with bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for the same population, with some parts of the world also approving this regimen for patients with ALK rearrangements or EGFR activating mutations. However, there are many other chemo-immunotherapy regimens  that have been evaluated as initial treatment in metastatic NSCLC. Additionally,  combinations of PD-1 axis inhibitors with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitors have been examined, although none are yet approved.

[Epub ahead of print],First-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement: state of the art and future development.,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 5% of all diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harbor a genetic rearrangement between the ALK and EML4 genes, representing a specific molecular, histological and clinical subgroup (ALK+ NSCLC). To date, upfront treatment with ALK-tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) has replaced chemotherapy in the first line setting for this subset of patients with excellent results. However, all treated patients eventually develop acquired resistance mechanisms to these agents (mainly resistance mutations) and experience progression of the disease. Areas covered: This paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art review about first-line approved ALK-TKIs, furthermore, it discusses the most promising ALK-TKIs under development designed  to overcome resistance mutations and their implications. Expert opinion: Alectinib should currently be regarded as the standard of care for the first-line treatment of ALK+ NSCLC, considering its superior efficacy and safety profile. Regarding developing agents, lorlatinib and ensartinib appear to be the most promising ones, even though the data from their trials are still immature.",ALK,1

Here, we present a NanoString gene expression platform and a novel platform-independent, single sample predictor (SSP) of NSCLC histology for combined, simultaneous, histological classification and fusion gene detection in  minimal formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. The SSP was developed in  68 NSCLC tumors of adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) histology, based on NanoString expression of 11 (CHGA, SYP, CD56, SFTPG, NAPSA, TTF-1, TP73L, KRT6A, KRT5, KRT40, KRT16) relevant genes for IHC-based NSCLC histology classification. The SSP was combined with a gene fusion detection module (analyzing ALK, RET, ROS1, MET, NRG1, and NTRK1) into a multicomponent NanoString assay. The histological SSP was validated in six cohorts varying in size (n = 11-199), tissue origin (early or advanced disease), histological composition (including undifferentiated cancer), and gene expression platform. Fusion gene detection revealed five EML4-ALK fusions, four KIF5B-RET fusions, two CD74-NRG1 fusion and three MET exon 14 skipping events among 131 tested cases. The histological SSP was successfully  trained and tested in the development cohort (mean AUC = 0.96 in iterated test sets). The SSP proved successful in predicting histology of NSCLC tumors of well-defined subgroups and difficult undifferentiated morphology irrespective of gene expression data platform. Discrepancies between gene expression prediction and histologic diagnosis included cases with mixed histologies, true large cell carcinomas, or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with mucin expression. In summary, we present a proof-of-concept multicomponent assay for parallel histological classification and multiplexed fusion gene detection in archival tissue, including a novel platform-independent histological SSP classifier.

[Epub ahead of print],Different Types of ROS1 Fusion Partners Yield Comparable Efficacy to Crizotinib.,"ROS1 rearrangements define a distinct molecular subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which can be treated effectively with crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting ROS1/MET/ALK rearrangements. Diverse efficacy was observed in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC patients. Because of its rareness, very limited studies have investigated the correlation between different fusion partners and response to crizotinib. In this study, we retrospectively screened 6,235 advanced NSCLC patients (Stage IIIB to IV) from 5 hospitals and identified  106 patients with ROS1-rearrangements based on either plasma or tumor tissue testing using capture based targeted sequencing. The most frequently occurred fusion partners included cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74), ezrin (EZR), syndecan 4 (SDC4) and tropomyosin 3 (TPM3), occurring in 49.1%, 17%, 14.2% and 4.7% of patients, respectively. Among them, 38 patients were treated with crizotinib. Seventeen patients were treatment-naïve and the remaining were previously treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. Collectively, there was no significant difference among patients with various types of ROS1 fusion partners  in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Patients who were treated with crizotinib as first line therapy showed comparable PFS (p=0.26) to patients who were previously treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. For treatment-naïve patients, patients with low baseline ROS1 allelic fraction (AF) had a statistically significant longer OS than those with high ROS1 AF (184 vs. 110 days, P = 0.048). Collectively, our study demonstrates ROS1-positive patients with various fusion partners show comparable efficacy to crizotinib.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Genomic Signature of Driver Genes Identified by Target Next-Generation Sequencing in Chinese Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common human malignancies and the leading cause of cancer-related death. Over the past few decades, genomic alterations of cancer driver genes have been identified in NSCLC, and molecular testing and targeted therapies have become standard care for lung cancer patients. Here we studied the unique genomic profile of driver genes  in Chinese patients with NSCLC by next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1,200 Chinese patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. The median age was 60 years (range: 26-89), and 83% cases were adenocarcinoma. NGS-based genomic profiling of major lung cancer-related genes was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples and matched blood. RESULTS: Approximately 73.9% of patients with NSCLC harbored at least one actionable alteration recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ALK, ERBB2, MET, BRAF, RET, and ROS1. Twenty-seven patients (2.2%) harbored inherited germline mutations of cancer susceptibility genes. The frequencies of EGFR genomic alterations (both mutations and amplification) and ALK rearrangement were identified as 50.1% and 7.8% in Chinese NSCLC populations, respectively, and significantly higher than the Western population. Fifty-six distinct uncommon EGFR mutations other than L858R, exon19del, exon20ins, or T790M were identified in 18.9% of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. About 7.4% of patients harbored both sensitizing and uncommon mutations, and 11.6% of patients harbored only uncommon  EGFR mutations. The uncommon EGFR mutations more frequently combined with the genomic alterations of ALK, CDKN2A, NTRK3, TSC2, and KRAS. In patients <40 years  of age, the ALK-positive percentage was up to 28.2%. Moreover, 3.2% of ALK-positive patients harbored multi ALK rearrangements, and seven new partner genes were identified. CONCLUSION: More unique features of cancer driver genes in Chinese NSCLC were identified by next-generation sequencing. These findings highlighted that NGS technology is more feasible and necessary than other molecular testing methods, and suggested that the special strategies are needed for drug development and targeted therapy for Chinese patients with NSCLC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Molecular targeted therapy is now the standard first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Samples of 1,200 Chinese patients with NSCLC were analyzed through next-generation sequencing to characterize the unique feature of uncommon EGFR mutations and ALK fusion. The results showed that 7.4% of EGFR-mutant patients harbored both sensitizing and uncommon mutations and 11.6% harbored only uncommon mutations. Uncommon EGFR mutations more frequently combined with the genomic alterations of ALK, CDKN2A, NTRK3, TSC2, and KRAS. ALK fusion was more common in  younger patients, and the frequency decreased monotonically with age. 3.2% of ALK-positive patients harbored multi ALK rearrangement, and seven new partner genes were identified.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print] ,verexpression of CD 133 and BCL-2 in non-small cell lung cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation after transformation in ALK rearrangement-positive adenocarcinoma.,"Transformation to small cell lung cancer is one phenomenon of acquired resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in ALK rearrangement-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Few case reports have  focused on other types of histological transformation. We report a case of transformation of ALK rearrangement-positive adenocarcinoma to NSCLC with neuroendocrine differentiation during alectinib therapy. A 36-year-old woman presented with a tumor in the left lower lobe and bone metastases. She was diagnosed with ALK rearrangement-positive adenocarcinoma by histopathology of the primary tumor. Alectinib had been effective for 8 months before new lesions appeared. Histopathological re-examination of a recurrent tumor revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) expression, which remained ALK-positive. Expression of CD133, BCL-2, and SOX2 was positive in comparison to the initial tumor. Expression of SOX2 became more strongly positive than it was before treatment. The immunohistochemical findings of these markers associated with cancer stem-like cells and/or neuroendocrine differentiation suggest that cancer stem cells play a role in the mechanisms of histological transformation and acquired resistance of ALK rearrangement-positive cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first report to suggest an association between cancer  stem-like cells and histological transformation in ALK rearrangement-positive lung cancer.",ALK,1

There are limited data on what factors predict peritoneal progression and affect the outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate investigate the factors associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis. METHODS: The patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the Department of Medical Oncology and Radiation Sickness, Peking University Third Hospital were eligible for retrospective analysis between August 2010 and August 2018. Clinical factors such as age, gender, histology, pleural effusion and gene mutations with  epidermal growth factor receptor/anaplastic lymphoma kinase/ROS proto-oncogene 1  receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR/ALK/ROS1) were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 1.44% (12/836) patients in this study developed peritoneal carcinomatosis and 12 patients with adenocarcinoma had metachronous NSCLC diagnosis and PC. Malignant pleural effusion rates at baseline and at PC diagnosis were separately 50% (6/12) and 100.0% (12/12). Among the 12 patients, 9 patients harbored EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation. The outcome of patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation was significantly better than that of patients without EGFR/ALK/ROS1 mutation, the mOS1 and mOS2 were separately 26.0 months and 6.0 months versus 10.0 months and 1.5 months (P<0.05). The mOS2 of patients with aggressive treatment after PC diagnosis was 6.0 months, significantly better than 1.0 month of patients with best supportive care (P<0.05). The mOS2 of the patients with angiogenesis inhibitors based-treatment after PC diagnosis was 8.5 months, significantly longer than that of patients with other treatments (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adenocarcinoma and malignant pleural effusion are highly associated  with peritoneal carcinomatosis in patients with advanced NSCLC. Aggressive treatment for lung cancer with PC is encouraged when possible. More patients with PC may benefit from the treatment strategies with angiogenesis inhibitors.

Several studies have shown that the  efficacy of pemetrexed in HER2-mutant NSCLC is controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of pemetrexed combined with platinum chemotherapy in patients with HER2-mutant and HER2 wild-type lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: The clinical data of 106 cases of EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, KRAS, BRAF, RET and  MET-negative patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients who diagnosed by histopathology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively reviewed. The relationships between HER2 gene status, clinical characteristics and response and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: All of the 106 patients' HER2 status were determined. HER2 mutations occurred in 32 cases (30.2%), no mutations in 74 cases (69.8%). HER2 mutations were common in young, non-smoking and female patients. All patients received first-line pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of patients with HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than those without HER2 mutations (40.6% vs 14.9%, χ²=8.464, P=0.004; 93.8% vs 68.9%, χ²=6.327, P=0.012), and the difference was statistically significant. According to univariate analysis, the PFS was significantly associated with the brain metastases, maintenance chemotherapy and HER2 gene status (P<0.05), but not with age, gender, smoking history, oligometastases, liver metastases and type of platinum (P>0.05). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that HER2 mutation was an independent positive prognostic factor of PFS (P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients with first-line pemetrexed  combined with platinum chemotherapy have greater clinical benefit than HER2 wild-type patients.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Clinical Management of Adverse Events Associated with Lorlatinib.,"Lorlatinib is a novel, highly potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation ALK/ROS1  tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which has broad-spectrum potency against most known resistance mutations that can develop during treatment with crizotinib and  second-generation ALK TKIs. The safety profile of lorlatinib was established based on 295 patients who had received the recommended dose of lorlatinib 100 mg  once daily. Adverse events associated with lorlatinib are primarily mild to moderate in severity, with hypercholesterolemia (82.4%), hypertriglyceridemia (60.7%), edema (51.2%), peripheral neuropathy (43.7%), and central nervous system effects (39.7%) among the most frequently reported. These can be effectively managed with dose modification and/or standard supportive medical therapy, as indicated by a low incidence of permanent discontinuations due to adverse reactions. Most patients (81.0%) received at least one lipid-lowering agent. Prescription of supportive therapy should also consider the potential for drug-drug interactions with lorlatinib via engagement of specific CYP450 enzymes. This article summarizes the clinical experience from lorlatinib phase I investigators and was generated from discussion and review of the clinical study  protocol and database to provide an expert consensus opinion on the management of the key adverse reactions reported with lorlatinib, including hyperlipidemia, central nervous system effects, weight increase, edema, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal effects. Overall, lorlatinib 100 mg once daily has a unique  safety profile to be considered when prescribed, based on the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with a second-generation ALK TKI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Despite the advancement of second-generation  anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the emergence of resistance and progression of central nervous system metastases remain clinically significant problems in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation, macrocyclic ALK/ROS1 TKI, with broad-spectrum potency against most known resistance mutations that can develop during treatment with existing first- and second-generation ALK TKIs.

In this phase 3 randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of treatment-naïve patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC, osimertinib was compared to standard-of-care EGFR TKIs (i.e., erlotinib or gefinitib) in the first-line setting. Osimertinib demonstrated improvement in median progression-free survival (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; hazard ratio 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.57; p < 0.001) and a more favorable toxicity profile due to its lower affinity for wild-type EGFR. Furthermore, similar to later-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, osimertinib has improved efficacy against brain metastases. Despite this impressive effect, the optimal sequencing  of osimertinib, whether in the first line or as subsequent therapy after the failure of earlier-generation EGFR TKIs, is not clear. Because up-front use of later-generation TKIs may result in the inability to use earlier-generation TKIs, this treatment paradigm must be evaluated carefully. For EGFR mutant NSCLC, considerations include the incidence of T790M resistance mutations, quality of life, whether there is a potential role for earlier-generation TKIs after osimertinib failure, and overall survival. This review explores these issues for  EGFR inhibitors and other molecularly targeted therapies.",ALK,1

However, the pattern of failure and clinical value of radiotherapy in metastatic crizotinib-treated ALK-mutant lung cancer, with or without baseline brain metastases (BBM), are largely unknown. METHODS: Consecutive crizotinib-treated NSCLC patients with adequate imaging and  measurable disease were retrospectively enrolled. Disease progression in original sites (primary/metastatic), new sites, or both, are classified as original failure (OF), distant failure (DF) and ODF, respectively. Progression free survival, from crizotinib initiation to the first disease progression, and from that to the second disease progression, were calculated as PFS1 and PFS2. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. With a median follow up of 22.0 (range, 2.0-72.0) months, 52 patients had crizotinib-treatment failure. The frequencies of OF, ODF, and DF, were 50.0, 26.9, and 23.1%, respectively. Histology, primary tumor size and presence of BBM, were independently associated  with OF, using competing risks analyses. The brain was the most common site of initial disease progression. Patients with BBM had a significant higher possibility developing multiple-progressive lesions in the brain (p = 0.002). Importantly, four of the ten patients who had baseline oligo-metastatic cranial disease but didn't receive upfront brain radiation, developed multiple-progressive disease in the brain. Brain radiation before crizotinib could alter the disease failure patterns and improve PFS1 among patients with BBM (p = 0.006). Extracranial radiation was efficient in controlling symptoms but it  was not associated with PFS1 (p = 0.223), and the majority of patients were eligible for salvage radiotherapy upon disease progression to crizotinib. By the  time of data cut-off, 28 patients had second disease progression, with a median PFS2 of 7.0 (95% CI 5.4-8.6) months and salvage radiotherapy significantly prolonged PFS2 (p = 0.003). Additionally, patients receiving any radiotherapy during their treatment course had a significant longer overall survival (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with baseline oligo-metastatic brain lesions which are suitable for stereotactic radiosurgery, upfront brain radiotherapy provides considerable clinical benefits. While, extracranial radiation may be deferred in  asymptomatic patients with multiple-metastatic lesions.",ALK,1

Mutations in epidermal  growth factor receptor (EGFR), and rearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are targetable in lung cancer, while BRAF mutations have been successfully  targeted in metastatic melanoma. Targeting estrogen receptors, cyclin dependent kinases, and HER2 (Human Epidermal Receptor) have resulted in improvement in survival in breast cancer. Major strides have been made in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma by targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. However, intracranial metastases remain a major hurdle in  the setting of targeted therapies. Traditional treatment options for brain metastases include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Surgery is effective in symptomatic patients with dominant lesions or solitary intracranial metastases, however, recovery time can be prolonged, often requiring an interruption in systemic treatment. WBRT and SRS provide symptomatic relief and local control but data on improving overall survival is limited. Most targeted therapies which provide extracranial control have limited penetration through the blood brain barrier. Given the limited therapeutic options and increasing prevalence of brain metastases, finding new strategies for the management of intracranial metastatic disease is critical. Genomic analysis of brain metastases has led to a better understanding of variations in the driver mutations compared to the primary malignancy. Furthermore, newer generations of targeted agents have shown promising intracranial activity. In this review, we will discuss the major molecular alterations in brain metastases from melanoma, lung, breast, and renal cell carcinoma. We will provide an in-depth review of the completed and ongoing clinical trials of drugs targeting the molecular pathways enriched in brain metastases.",ALK,1

However, the long-term efficacy of EGFR-TKI therapy is limited due to the development of drug resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the aberrant alterations of 8 driver genes and the primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in advanced NSCLC patients with activated EGFR mutations. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data from 416 patients with stage III/IV or recurrent NSCLC who received an initial EGFR-TKI treatment, from  April 2004 and March 2011, at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Several genetic alterations associated with the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs, including the alterations in BIM, ALK, KRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, MET, IGF1R, and ROS1, were detected  by the routine clinical technologies. The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between different groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test. A Cox regression model was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with the PFS and OS. RESULTS: Among the investigated patients, 169 NSCLC patients harbored EGFR-sensitive mutations. EGFR-mutant patients having PTEN deletion had a shorter PFS and OS than those with intact PTEN (P = 0.003 for PFS, and P = 0.034 for OS). In the combined molecular analysis of EGFR signaling pathway and resistance genes, we found that EGFR-mutant patients coexisted with aberrant alterations in  EGFR signaling pathway and those having resistant genes had a statistically poorer PFS than those without such alterations (P < 0.001). A Cox proportional regression model determined that PTEN deletion (HR = 4.29,95% CI = 1.72-10.70) and low PTEN expression (HR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.22-3.13), MET FISH + (HR = 2.83,95% CI = 1.37-5.86) were independent predictors for PFS in patients with EGFR-TKI treatment after adjustment for multiple factor.

We aimed to investigate whether developmental signaling pathways activation can stratify the risk of driver gene-negative lung adenocarcinoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the discovery phase, we profiled the mRNA expression of each candidate gene using genome-wide microarrays in 52 paired lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues. In the training phase, tissue microarrays and LASSO Cox regression analysis were applied to further screen candidate molecules in 189 patients, and we developed a predictive signature. In  the validation phase, one internal cohort and two external cohorts were used to validate our novel prognostic signature. RESULTS: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis based on whole-genome microarrays indicated that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated in driver gene-negative lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway-based gene expression profiles revealed 39 transcripts differentially expressed. Finally, a Wnt/β-catenin pathway-based CSDW signature comprising 4 genes (CTNNB1 or β-catenin, SOX9, DVL3, and Wnt2b) was developed to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups in the training cohort. Patients with high-risk scores in the training cohort had shorter overall survival [HR, 10.42;  6.46-16.79; P < 0.001) than patients with low-risk scores.

METHODS: This retrospective US cohort study used Flatiron Health's longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)-derived database. Patients (≥ 18 years old) diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV aNSCLC, with documented ALK rearrangement and ≥2 visits after January 1, 2011 were followed until February 28, 2016. Patients enrolled on a clinical trial or exposed to ALK inhibitors other than crizotinib or ceritinib were excluded. Treatment patterns, time and type of biomarker testing, and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Median age (n = 300) was 62.5 years; 55% female; 48% non-smokers; 8.7% central nervous system (CNS) metastases at diagnosis. Overall, 73% and 86% received their first ALK biomarker test before/at diagnosis, or before/during first-line treatment, respectively. In total, 90.0%, 78.1%, and 74.7% received first-, second-, and third-line therapy, respectively. Most patients received ALK-targeted treatment; 62% received crizotinib, of which 21% reported a dose reduction. Progression was the most common reason for crizotinib (78%) and ceritinib (41%) discontinuation. Median OS was 29.4 months (95% CI =24.7-39.6) overall; 27.1 months (95% CI =22.0-35.0) in patients with CNS metastases, and 36.9 months (95% CI =25.1-not reached) without. CONCLUSIONS: Despite widespread crizotinib use in patients with ALK+ aNSCLC, a high proportion of patients progressed. Ongoing analyses of EHR-derived cohorts are valuable in assessing real-world testing rates and therapeutic use of ALK inhibitors.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Jan 17.,Prediction of ALK mutations mediating ALK-TKIs resistance and drug re-purposing to overcome the resistance.,"BACKGROUND: Alectinib has shown a greater efficacy to ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancers in first-line setting; however, most patients relapse due to acquired resistance, such as secondary mutations in ALK including I1171N and G1202R. Although ceritinib or lorlatinib was shown to be effective to these resistant mutants, further resistance often emerges due to ALK-compound mutations in relapse patients following the use of ceritinib or lorlatinib. However, the drug for overcoming resistance has not been established yet. METHODS: We established lorlatinib-resistant cells harboring ALK-I1171N or -G1202R compound mutations by performing ENU mutagenesis screening or using an in vivo mouse model. We performed drug screening to overcome the lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutations. To evaluate these resistances in silico, we developed a modified computational molecular dynamic simulation (MP-CAFEE). FINDINGS: We identified 14 lorlatinib-resistant ALK-compound mutants, including several mutants that were recently discovered in lorlatinib-resistant patients. Some of these compound mutants were found to be sensitive to early generation ALK-TKIs and several BCR-ABL inhibitors. Using our original computational simulation, we succeeded in demonstrating a clear linear correlation between binding free energy and in vitro experimental IC50 value of several ALK-TKIs to single- or compound-mutated EML4-ALK expressing Ba/F3 cells and in recapitulating the tendency of the binding affinity reduction by double mutations found in this  study. Computational simulation revealed that ALK-L1256F single mutant conferred  resistance to lorlatinib but increased the sensitivity to alectinib. INTERPRETATION: We discovered lorlatinib-resistant multiple ALK-compound mutations and an L1256F single mutation as well as the potential therapeutic strategies for these ALK mutations. Our original computational simulation to calculate the binding affinity may be applicable for predicting resistant mutations and for overcoming drug resistance in silico.

Epub 2019 Jan 17., Oral coadministration of elacridar and ritonavir enhances brain accumulation and oral availability of the novel ALK/ROS1 inhibitor lorlatinib.,"Lorlatinib, a novel generation oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 inhibitor with high membrane and blood-brain barrier permeability, recently received accelerated approval for treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and its further clinical development is ongoing. We previously found that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1) restricts lorlatinib brain accumulation and that the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) limits its oral availability. Using genetically modified mouse models, we investigated the impact of targeted pharmacological inhibitors on lorlatinib pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. Upon oral administration of lorlatinib, the plasma AUC0-8h in CYP3A4-humanized mice was ∼1.8-fold lower than  in wild-type and Cyp3a-/- mice. Oral coadministration of the CYP3A inhibitor ritonavir caused reversion to the AUC0-8h levels seen in wild-type and Cyp3a-/- mice, without altering the relative tissue distribution of lorlatinib. Moreover,  simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 with oral elacridar and ritonavir in CYP3A4-humanized mice profoundly increased lorlatinib  brain concentrations, but not its oral availability or other relative tissue distribution. Oral lorlatinib pharmacokinetics was not significantly affected by  absence of the multispecific Oatp1a/1b drug uptake transporters. The absolute oral bioavailability of lorlatinib over 8 h in wild-type, Cyp3a-/-, and CYP3A4-humanized mice was 81.6%, 72.9%, and 58.5%, respectively. Lorlatinib thus  has good oral bioavailability, which is markedly restricted by human CYP3A4 but not by mouse Cyp3a. Pharmacological inhibition of CYP3A4 reversed these effects,  and simultaneous P-gp inhibition with elacridar boosted absolute brain levels of  lorlatinib by 16-fold without obvious toxicity. These insights may help to optimize the clinical application of lorlatinib.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Dec 28.,LK testing methods: is there a winner or loser?,"INTRODUCTION: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is one of the most attractive molecular targets for the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.  Treatment with ALK inhibitors is recognized as the standard-of-care for patients  with ALK gene rearrangements, but it is important to appropriately select patients who will benefit from such treatment. Areas covered: In this article, we review the evidence regarding ALK testing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the representative methods for detecting ALK gene fusions. Among these diagnostic modalities, IHC in particular exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ALK fusions when appropriately applied and interpreted. Expert commentary: Discrepancies have been reported between the results of IHC and FISH. However, it was revealed that patients with  IHC-positivity and FISH-negativity may respond to alectinib, indicating that IHC  can be used as a stand-alone method from a clinical standpoint for the identification of patients eligible for treatment with ALK inhibitors. In addition, differences between ALK variants have been reported to affect the prognosis and efficacy of ALK inhibitor-based treatments, and RT-PCR will likely  increase in importance as a complementary tool.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Jan 30., Lorlatinib for the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small cell lung cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 3-5% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer （NSCLC）belonged to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive NSCLC. The treatment drugs of ALK-positive NSCLC mainly included crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, and brigatinib. Although these drugs had some effects, most of them were usually easy to develop drug resistance. Lorlatinib is a new inhibitor of ALK for treating ALK-positive NSCLC,the effect is obvious, and not easy to develop resistance. Areas covered: The main mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy  and safety of lorlatinib were introduced in this paper. Expert commentary: Lorlatinib is a new, reversible, ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor of ALK  and c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1). It can inhibit tumor cell growth in ALK- and ROS1-overexpressing tumor cells. Clinical trial indicated that lorlatinib had obvious therapeutic effect for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. Lorlatinib could also pass through the blood-brain barrier, which had a good effect on patients with brain metastasis. Adverse events of lorlatinib were mostly mild and moderate in severity, and patients were easily tolerated. Most common adverse events were  edema, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive effects, dyspnea, fatigue, weight gain, arthralgia, mood effects, and diarrhea.",ALK,1

Areas covered: The identification of genetic driver alterations led to the selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and  rat osteosarcoma (ROS-1) tyrosine kinase inhibitors; on the other hand, in the absence of oncogenic alterations, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimens were the cornerstone of treatment. However, the advent of immunotherapy has widely changed the first-line treatment.

Epub 2019 Jan  8., Updated Analysis of KEYNOTE-024: Pembrolizumab Versus Platinum-Based Chemotherapy for Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer With PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score of 50%  or Greater.,"PURPOSE: In the randomized, open-label, phase III KEYNOTE-024 study, pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a programmed death ligand 1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater and without EGFR/ALK aberrations. We report an updated OS and tolerability analysis, including analyses adjusting for potential bias introduced by crossover from chemotherapy to pembrolizumab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (for up to 2 years) or investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy (four to six cycles). Patients assigned to chemotherapy could cross  over to pembrolizumab upon meeting eligibility criteria. The primary end point was progression-free survival; OS was an important key secondary end point. Crossover adjustment analysis was done using the following three methods: simplified two-stage method, rank-preserving structural failure time, and inverse probability of censoring weighting. RESULTS: Three hundred five patients were randomly assigned (pembrolizumab, n = 154; chemotherapy, n = 151). At data cutoff (July 10, 2017; median follow-up, 25.2 months), 73 patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 96 in the chemotherapy arm had died. Median OS was 30.0 months (95% CI, 18.3 months to not reached) with pembrolizumab and 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.8 to 19.0 months) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.86). Eighty-two patients assigned to chemotherapy crossed over on study to receive pembrolizumab. When adjusted for crossover using the two-stage method, the hazard ratio for OS for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy was 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.69); results using rank-preserving structural failure time and inverse probability of censoring weighting were similar. Treatment-related grade 3 to 5 adverse events were less frequent with pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy (31.2% v 53.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: With prolonged follow-up, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy continues to demonstrate an OS benefit over chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated, advanced NSCLC without EGFR/ALK aberrations, despite crossover from the control arm to pembrolizumab as subsequent therapy.",ALK,1

Methods: Biopsy records of 196 malignant lung lesions were reviewed. Core obtained from each needle pass was put in a separate container for individual pathological analysis. Types of molecular analysis attempted and their success rates were recorded for each patient. We categorized each patient into one of six groups according to the number of cores (n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4, n=5, n≥6) acquired,  and diagnostic sensitivity for histopathologic diagnosis was calculated for each  core in each group. In order to assess the increase in cumulative sensitivity up  to 4th core, the data from 1st to 4th needle passes in 4-, 5-, and ≥6-core groups were pooled and cumulative diagnostic sensitivities up to 4th core were calculated. Results: Of 196 cases of lung malignancies, five different types of molecular studies (EGFR mutation, ALK translocation, KRAS mutation, RET and ROS1 rearrangements) were attempted with PCNB specimens in 100 cases and successfully  done in 96 cases (96.0%). In ≥4-core group (4-, 5-, and ≥6-core groups combined;  n=148), cumulative sensitivity increased from 83.8% to 89.9% between 1st and 2nd  cores, 89.9% to 93.2% between 2nd and 3rd cores, and 93.2% to 94.6% between 3rd and 4th cores. Conclusions: The cumulative diagnostic sensitivity for the histopathologic diagnosis increases significantly between the second and fourth sampling.

There is a need to identify and evaluate new ROS1 fusions and the response to targeted therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel was used to analyze DNA extracted from tumor tissue and blood samples from an NSCLC patient. Results were validated using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: We found a novel ROS1 rearrangement form, namely a WNK1-ROS1 fusion. The transmembrane and kinase domains of ROS1 remained intact in this fusion. No EGFR, MET, KRAS, ALK, ROS1 or other NSCLC driver mutations were detected in the patient. The patient achieved a partial response after treatment with crizotinib. When disease progressed, ROS1 G2032R mutation-a classical mechanism of crizotinib resistance-was detected in the DNA sample extracted from the patient's plasma sample. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel WNK1-ROS1 fusion that was sensitive to crizotinib and developed an ROS1 G2032R mutation when the disease progressed. The WNK1-ROS1 rearrangement appeared to be a novel driver of the lung cancer.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Dec 28., Incidence of brain metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma at initial diagnosis on the  basis of stage and genetic alterations.,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) are at higher risk of the development of brain metastasis (BM), and genetic alterations are associated with BM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 598 patients with lung ADC in our institution between January 2014 and December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. We evaluated the incidence of BM by stage and genetic alterations. RESULTS: Of the 598 patients, 97 (16.2%) had BM, which occurred across all stages. The incidence of BM showed a tendency to increase as the stage increased  (p < 0.001, trend test). Although patients with EGFR mutations had BM across all  stages, those with ALK or K- mutations had BM only in stage III and IV diseases.  Regardless of types of mutations, the incidence of BM showed a tendency to increase as the T or N staging increased (p < 0.001 for each of EGFR, ALK, and K-RAS mutations, trend test). Whereas BM incidence showed a tendency to increase  as the M staging increased in patients with EGFR-mutant lung ADC (p < 0.001, trend test), there was no linear trend between M staging and ALK (p = 0.469, trend test) or K-RAS mutations (p = 0.066, trend test). After adjusting covariables, EGFR mutations were associated with BM in never-smokers (adjusted OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.02-4.34) and K-RAS mutations were risk factors for BM in males (adjusted OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 1.01-14.43). CONCLUSIONS: BM occurred in approximately 16% of lung ADC patients, including 3%  with stage I diseases. Whereas EGFR-mutant lung ADC had BM across all stages, ALK- or K-RAS-mutant lung ADC had BM only in advanced stages. EGFR mutations were risk factors for BM among never-smokers and K-RAS mutations were risk factors among males.",ALK,1

Crizotinib, as an ALK inhibitor, has been used in the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC for several years and some adverse effects  should be given attention. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old woman with a no-smoking history visited hospital  in November 2016 because of a persistent cough, expectoration, and progressive dysphagia for 2 months. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: She was diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma,  accompanied by pleural and bone metastases. After receiving chemotherapy for nearly 1 year, she showed progressive disease. DNA-sequencing identified an intergenic ALK rearrangement. Surprisingly, RNA-sequencing revealed the EML4-ALK  fusion transcript. Subsequently, this patient switched to crizotinib therapy. OUTCOMES: The patient achieved partial response after 1-month treatment. However, this patient suffered a severe sinus bradycardia after 4 months of treatment. When reducing the dose of crizotinib, the side effect was alleviated and this patient showed stable disease until now. LESSONS: Given that the severe sinus bradycardia was an unusual adverse effect, physicians should be aware of these side effects when using crizotinib. Moreover, it should be noted that this patient harbored an intergenic ALK rearrangement identified by DNA-sequencing, but EML4-ALK fusion transcript verified by RNA-sequencing. However, the mechanism remains unknown and requires further research.",ALK,1

Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement are usually mutually exclusive, EGFR and ALK co-alterations have been reported increasingly in cases of NSCLC. However, the optimal treatment for these cases has not been established. PATIENT CONCERNS: This case series describes three patients diagnosed with advanced non-squamous NSCLC who harbored EGFR and ALK co-alterations. The complaints for each case are as follows: 57-year-old woman with coughing and dyspnea in case 1, 32-year-old man with diplopia in case 2 and 77-year-old woman  with chest discomfort in case 3. DIAGNOSES: Three never-smokers were diagnosed pathologically with stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. Subsequent molecular studies revealed the EGFR L858R  mutation gene and ALK rearrangement, which were proven by real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: All 3 patients received first-line therapy with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Cases 1 and 2 were treated with ALK-TKIs as second-line therapy and received additional EGFR-TKIs as third- and fourth-line regimens. OUTCOMES: The patients achieved partial responses to EGFR-TKIs according to radiologic findings. However, second-line ALK-TKI therapy was ineffective in cases 1 and 2. LESSONS: Cases of NSCLC with concomitant EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement are  rare, and the selection of an optimal targeted therapy is challenging. Here, EGFR-TKI appeared to yield better outcomes than ALK-TKI in patients with NSCLC who harbored EGFR/ALK co-alterations.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Jan 25., Predictive and prognostic value of phosphorylated c-KIT and PDGFRA in advanced non-small cell lung cancer harboring ALK fusion.,"Secondary KIT gene amplification leads to tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The presence of the 4q12 amplicon causes the activation of downstream mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit (c-Kit) or platelet-derived  growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) signaling pathways. Therefore, in the present study, the association between the functional proteins phosphorylated c-Kit (p-c-Kit) and phosphorylated PDGFRA (p-PDGFRA) and the prognosis of ALK fusion NSCLC was investigated. Advanced stage NSCLC samples with ALK fusion were tested  for their p-c-Kit and p-PDGFRA content by immunohistochemical staining, and for its association with crizotinib efficacy and the survival of the patients. Of 64  eligible ALK-positive patients with NSCLC, 30 (46.9%) were p-c-Kit-positive and 10 (15.7%) were p-PDGFRA-positive. Brain metastases were more common in ALK-positive cases that were p-PDGFRA-positive compared with those who were p-PDGFRA-negative. ALK-positive patients treated with crizotinib, who exhibited high levels of p-c-Kit had significantly lower progression-free survival times than those with low levels. In addition, the patients with high levels of p-c-Kit exhibited lower overall survival times than those with low levels. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that high levels of p-c-Kit in patients with ALK  fusion was the only significant predictive factor for crizotinib efficacy and was a prognostic factor for poor overall survival time. However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the survival of patients with different p-PDGFRA levels. p-PDGFRA was more frequently expressed in the ALK-positive cases with brain metastasis. c-Kit signaling activation may be associated with poor efficacy of crizotinib and poor prognosis in advanced ALK fusion NSCLC.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Dec 10.," Expression of mucins (MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6) in ALK-positive lung cancer: Comparison with EGFR-mutated lung cancer.","ALK-positive (ALK+) lung adenocarcinoma usually shows a more advanced-staged disease with frequent nodal metastasis and highly aggressive outcomes compared with EGFR-mutated lung cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profiles of several mucins in ALK + lung cancers to gain insight into  the relationship between the more aggressive biological nature of ALK + lung cancers and the role of mucins. We examined the immunohistochemical profiles of mucins MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 in 19 ALK + lung cancers compared with 42 EGFR-mutated lung cancers. ALK + cancers were found to occur in younger patients  and were characterized by a solid-predominant histologic subtype with frequent signet ring cells and peritumoral muciphages. By contrast, EGFR-mutated cancers lacked ALK-specific histological patterns. Although all MUC1 and MUC5AC were expressed in both subtypes, MUC1 expression in ALK + cancers was visualized exclusively through cytoplasmic staining, whereas those in EGFR-mutated cancers were predominantly membranous staining in apical area (92.9%) and focally in cytoplasmic staining (7.1%). MUC5AC expression in ALK + cancers was exclusively visualized through cytoplasmic staining (100%), whereas EGFR-mutated cancers showed predominantly perinuclear dot-like patterns (90.5%) and focal cytoplasmic  staining (9.5%). MUC2 and MUC6 expression was not detected in either type of lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of both MUC1 and MUC5AC cytoplasmic expression, coupled with a lack of MUC2 and MUC6 expression in ALK + lung cancer  may contribute to the biologically aggressive behavior of ALK + cancer. Inhibitors to these types of mucins may thus act as a barrier to cancerous extension reducing their aggressive behavior.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Jan 12.,Somatic mutations and immune checkpoint biomarkers.,"The development of molecular testing for identifying somatic mutations and immune checkpoint biomarkers has directed treatment towards personalized medicine for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The choice of molecular testing in a clinical setting is influenced by cost, expertise in the technology, instrumentation setup and sample type availability. The molecular techniques described in this review include immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in situ  hybridization, direct sequencing, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing (NGS). IHC is routinely used in clinical practice for the classification, differentiation, histology and identification of targetable alterations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Recently, the PD-L1 pathway was identified as being exploited by tumour cells, allowing immune resistance and tumour evasion. The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors as treatment for  tumours expressing checkpoints has highlighted the need for standardized IHC assays to inform treatment decisions for patients. Direct sequencing was historically the gold standard for mutation testing for EGFR, KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue) and BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homologue B1) requiring a high ratio of tumour to normal cells, but this has been superseded by more sensitive methods. NGS is a new emerging technique, which allows high-throughput coverage of frequently mutated genes, including less common BRAF and MET mutations and alterations in tumour suppressor genes. When an NGS platform is unavailable, PCR-based technologies offer an efficient and cost-effective single gene test to guide patient treatment. This article will review these techniques and discuss the future of molecular platforms underpinning clinical management decisions.",ALK,1

Here, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based mutation detection system, mutation-selected amplification-specific  system PCR (MASS-PCR), is developed. The specific primers and probes used in MASS-PCR exactly match with the mutant sequence that only allows mutant gene to emit the fluorescence peak. To determine the sensitivity of MASS-PCR, 717 lung cancer specimens, 61 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, and 656 fresh reaction tissues are collected and undergo mutation detection of lung cancer driver genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER2, MET, ALK, and ROS1). These samples are divided into two groups. Mutations in Group I, which has 631 fresh reaction tissues, are analyzed by MASS-PCR and the amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR). While group II samples, 25 fresh reaction tissues and 61 FFPE tissues, are screened through MASS-PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS). All results are verified by direct sequencing. MASS-PCR shows high consistency with ARMS-PCR (kappa value > 0.733) and NGS (kappa value = 0.79) (P < 0.001). For the samples with inconsistent MASS-PCR and ARMS-PCR results, DS results more likely support the MASS-PCR results. These data suggest that MASS-PCR is a convenient, accurate, and economical method for the detection of lung cancer driver gene mutations in clinical practice.",ALK,1

Since ALK⁻driven tumors are dependent for their proliferation on the constitutively activated ALK kinase, a number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to block tumor growth. While some inhibitors are under investigation in clinical trials, others are now  approved for treatment, notably in ALK-positive lung cancer. Their efficacy is remarkable, however limited in time, as the tumors escape and become resistant to the treatment through different mechanisms. Hence, there is a pressing need to target ALK-dependent tumors by other therapeutic strategies, and possibly use them in combination with kinase inhibitors. In this review we will focus on the therapeutic potential of proapoptotic ALK-derived peptides based on the dependence receptor properties of ALK. We will also try to make a non-exhaustive  list of several alternative treatments targeting ALK-dependent and independent signaling pathways.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print],Relevance of Detection of Mechanisms of Resistance to ALK Inhibitors in ALK-Rearranged NSCLC in Routine Practice.,"BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown efficacy in the treatment of ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the disease eventually progresses in all patients. In many cases, resistance to ALK TKIs arises through ALK mutations. Although clinical and biological data suggest variations in TKI efficacy according to the mechanism of  resistance, ALK mutations are still rarely investigated in routine practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicentric study with an aim to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of ALK alterations detected using targeted next-generation sequencing in patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC after progression during an ALK TKI treatment. Data on clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics and patient outcomes were collected. RESULTS: We identified 23 patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC who, between January 2012 and May 2017, had undergone at least 1 repeat biopsy at progression during an ALK TKI treatment. A resistance mechanism was identified in 9 of the 23 patients (39%). The anomalies involved included 9 ALK mutations in 8  patients and one ALK amplification. The ALK mutation rate was 15% after failure of a first ALK TKI and 33% after failure of 2 ALK TKI treatments. Five of 7 patients who received a different ALK TKI after detection of an ALK mutation achieved an objective response. All of the patients who received a TKI presumed to act on the detected ALK mutant achieved disease control. CONCLUSION: Targeted next-generation sequencing is suitable for detecting ALK resistance mutations in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients in routine practice. It might help select the best treatment at the time of disease progression during treatment with an ALK TKI.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print], Next-generation Sequencing for ALK and ROS1 Rearrangement Detection in Patients With Non-small-cell Lung Cancer: Implications of FISH-positive Patterns.,"BACKGROUND: Detection of ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements in non-small-cell lung  cancer is required for directing patient care. Although fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry have been established as gold standard methods, next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms are called to be at  least equally successful. Comparison of these methods for translation into daily  use is currently under investigation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty non-small-cell lung cancer paraffin-embedded samples  with previous ALK (n = 33) and ROS1 (n = 7) FISH results were examined with the Oncomine Focus Assay and tested for ALK and ROS1 immunoreactivity. Clinical implications of concurrent molecular alterations and concordance between methods  were evaluated. RESULTS: NGS was successful in 32 (80%) cases: 25 ALK and 7 ROS1. Few concomitant alterations were detected: 1 ALK rearranged case had an ALK p.L1196M-resistant mutation, 4 had CDK4, MYC, and/or ALK amplifications, and 1 ROS1 rearranged case  showed a FGFR4 amplification. Comparison between techniques revealed 5 (16%) discordant cases that had lower progression-free survival than concordant cases:  7.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.2-13) versus 19.4 (95% confidence interval, 10.1-28.6). Remarkably, 4 of these cases had isolated 3' signal FISH pattern (P = .026). CONCLUSION: Our data support that the identification of 3' isolated signal FISH pattern in ALK and ROS1 cases might suggest a false-positive result. NGS seems a  reliable technique to assess ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, offering the advantage  over immunohistochemistry of detecting other molecular alterations with potential therapeutic implications.",ALK,1

Genetic and molecular profiling of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has led to the discovery of actionable oncogenic driver alterations, which has revolutionized treatment for this disease. This review will move beyond traditional mutational drivers such as EGFR and ALK and will instead focus on emerging targets and the efficacy of new precision therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Here, we discuss both established and emerging targeted therapy  approaches, as well as ongoing challenges for the treatment of NSCLC patients harboring oncogenic alterations of the following types-gene fusions (ROS1, RET, NTRK), receptor tyrosine kinases (MET amplification and exon 14 mutations and EGFR/HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations), and MAPK signaling (SHP2 and altered BRAF and NF1). The treatment of lung cancer is increasingly biomarker-driven, as patients are selected for targeted agents based on the identification of genetic  alterations amenable to inhibition. Our ability to further improve patient outcomes with this precision medicine approach will require continued efforts to  identify, characterize, and target lesions driving lung cancer tumorigenesis and  progression.",ALK,1

The aim was to identify the accuracy  of molecular analysis that were performed with EBUS-GS specimens in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD: From December 2015 to September 2017, we retrospectively studied 91 patients with peripheral NSCLC who underwent surgery after EBUS-GS. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation status obtained from surgical specimens served as the references. RESULTS: Compared to the reference data, EGFR mutational testing of EBUS-GS specimens was in 97% agreement, and the κ coefficient was 0.931 (P< 0.001). In addition, on ALK translocation testing, the results of all 91 patients were in agreement with the reference data (concordance rate of 100%, κ coefficient 1.000; P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found that EBUS-GS could be used for molecular diagnosis, such as  EGFR mutational and ALK translocation status, in patients with peripheral NSCLC.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead of print]," Genotype Driven Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Resistance, Pan Inhibitors and Immunotherapy.","Eighty-five percent of patients with lung cancer present with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapy approaches are promising treatments for lung cancer. However, despite the development of targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as well as monoclonal antibodies, the five-year relative  survival rate for lung cancer patients is still only 18%, and patients inevitably become resistant to therapy. Mutations in Kirsten ras sarcoma viral homolog (KRAS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the two most common genetic events in lung adenocarcinoma; they account for 25% and 20% of cases, respectively. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, and ALK rearrangements are responsible for 3-7% of NSCLC, predominantly of the adenocarcinoma subtype, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner with KRAS and EGFR mutations. Among drug-resistant NSCLC patients, nearly  half exhibit the T790M mutation in exon 20 of EGFR. This review focuses on some basic aspects of molecules involved in NSCLC, the development of resistance to treatments in NSCLC, and advances in lung cancer therapy in the past ten years. Some recent developments such as PD-1-PD-L1 checkpoint-based immunotherapy for NSCLC are also covered.",ALK,1

We also make a literature review about the key factors that characterize this histology and that should be considered when treating those patients. Sarcomatoid carcinoma presents with mutations as KRAS, EGFR, ALK or MET in up to 70% of cases, and an important expression of PD-L1 (also called B7-H1), which can influence treatment of those patients with new drugs as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immunotherapy has changed the horizon of patients with stage IV lung cancers without driver mutations, as their survival has improved extraordinary. Moreover, radical treatments are being considered in long survivors with oligometastatic disease. In this report, we review targeted and radical therapy, treatment duration and the mechanisms responsible of disease evolution of sarcomatoid tumors.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 Feb 4., Genome-wide colocalization of RNA-DNA interactions and fusion RNA pairs.,"Fusion transcripts are used as biomarkers in companion diagnoses. Although more than 15,000 fusion RNAs have been identified from diverse cancer types, few common features have been reported. Here, we compared 16,410 fusion transcripts detected in cancer (from a published cohort of 9,966 tumor samples of 33 cancer types) with genome-wide RNA-DNA interactions mapped in two normal, noncancerous cell types [using iMARGI, an enhanced version of the mapping of RNA-genome interactions (MARGI) assay]. Among the top 10 most significant RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells, 5 colocalized with the gene pairs that formed fusion RNAs in cancer. Furthermore, throughout the genome, the frequency of a gene pair to exhibit RNA-DNA interactions is positively correlated with the probability of this gene pair to present documented fusion transcripts in cancer. To test whether RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells are predictive of fusion RNAs, we analyzed these in a validation cohort of 96 lung cancer samples using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Thirty-seven of 42 fusion transcripts in the validation cohort were found to exhibit RNA-DNA interactions in normal cells. Finally, by combining RNA-seq, single-molecule RNA FISH, and DNA FISH, we detected a cancer sample with EML4-ALK fusion RNA without forming the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Collectively, these data suggest an RNA-poise model, where spatial proximity of RNA and DNA could poise for the creation of fusion transcripts.",ALK,1

Angiogenesis inhibitors have been used in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line and maintenance settings providing improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), as well as overall survival (OS) in selected studies. Biologic rationale exists for combining anti-angiogenic agents with immunotherapy and targeted kinase inhibitors (TKIs). A recent study has demonstrated improved survival when anti-PD-L1 therapy was added to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. Subgroup analysis of patients with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene and rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene also demonstrated benefit with combined anti-PD-L1, bevacizumab, and platinum chemotherapy. Further investigation into combination therapy is warranted in the EGFR- and ALK-positive population given this signal. Anti-angiogenics combined with EGFR-targeted treatment in the wild-type population have shown modest PFS benefit with no OS benefit, and their routine use has not been adopted. The combination of EGFR inhibitors plus vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors in the EGFR mutation-positive population has demonstrated substantial improvements in response and PFS; however, given the higher toxicity and lack of survival benefit to date, combination therapy in this group should be used with caution. At the present time, use of bevacizumab can be recommended with atezolizumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC patients. Data with other checkpoint inhibitors and anti-angiogenics are too early to make firm recommendations regarding their use.",ALK,1

Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2019 Feb 15;20(3):19. doi: 10.1007/s11864-019-0618-5.,Current Treatment Options for Breast Cancer Brain Metastases.,"OPINION STATEMENT: In the past, the standard of care for treatment of BM was whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and surgery. There has been a greater role for medical therapies in the last two decades due to the discovery of driver mutations and corresponding targeted therapies. These innovations have dramatically altered the approach to treating these patients. Some of the important mutations include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations in small cell lung cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) mutation in breast cancer,  and BRAF mutation in melanoma. Disease-specific graded prognostic assessments have identified prognostic factors for each of the major tumor types associated with BM. These reflect the increased treatment sensitivity of these tumors to specific agents. Furthermore, there is a difference in the genetic makeup of BM compared to their primary tumor. Genomic studies of BM patients comparing somatic point mutations and copy number variations with their primary tumor have demonstrated that while both the primary tumor and BM share a number of common mutations, BM can often develop distinct mutations. Therefore, there is a need to individualize systemic therapies in BM. Several organizations including the Food  and Drug Administration and the American Society of Clinical Oncology now emphasize the inclusion of BM patients in various phases of clinical drug development.",ALK,1

The aim of the study was to  analyze the EGFR, KRAS, ALK, RET, ROS1, BRAF, ERBB2, MET and PIK3CA mutational status in a representative cohort of Swiss patients with lung adenocarcinoma and  to correlate the mutational status with clinicopathological patient characteristics. METHODS: All patients who underwent molecular testing of newly diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma during a 4-year period (2014-2018) were included. Molecular analyses were performed with Sanger sequencing (n = 158) and next generation sequencing (n = 311). ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion gene analyses were also performed  with fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the medical records. RESULTS: Of 469 patients with informative EGFR mutation analyses, 90 (19.2%) had  EGFR mutations. KRAS mutations were present in 33.9% of the patients, while 6.0%  of patients showed ALK rearrangement. BRAF, ERBB2, MET and PIK3CA mutations and ROS1 and RET rearrangements were found in 2.6%, 1.9%, 1.9%, 1.5%, 1.7% and 0.8% of the patients, respectively. EGFR mutation was significantly associated with female gender and never smoking status. ALK translocations were more frequent in  never smokers, while KRAS mutations were more commonly found in ever smokers. The association between KRAS mutational status and female gender was statistically significant only on multivariate analysis after adjusting for smoking. CONCLUSION: The EGFR mutation rate in the current study is among the higher previously reported mutation rates, while the frequencies of KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2 and PIK3CA mutations and ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements are similar to the results of previous reports. EGFR and KRAS mutations were significantly associated with gender and smoking. ALK rearrangements showed a significant association with smoking status alone.",ALK,1

[Epub ahead  of print], Uterine Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor Showing an Atypical ALK Signal Pattern by FISH and DES-ALK Fusion by RNA Sequencing: A Case Report.,"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are spindle cell neoplasms of intermediate (borderline) biologic potential with tendency for local recurrence but low risk of metastasis. They affect children more than adults. The most common sites of involvement are the lung, soft tissue, peritoneum, bladder, and less commonly the gynecologic tract. IMTs are characterized by spindle to epithelioid cells with myofibroblastic differentiation, some degree of smooth muscle differentiation, myxoid stroma and usually associated with brisk lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. In about half of the cases, IMTs are associated with rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene located at chromosome 2p23. The ALK rearrangement can be detected by immunohistochemistry for ALK protein expression (mostly cytoplasmic with or without perinuclear accentuation) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using dual-color break-apart probes for which the typical pattern is seen as split 3' end (red) and 5' end (green) probe signals in addition to single normal, unsplit red-green  signal pair (yellow). Herein we describe a case of uterine IMT initially misdiagnosed intraoperatively as leiomyoma which showed sparse lymphocytic infiltrates, positive ALK expression by immunohistochemistry, a predominantly atypical FISH signal pattern (1 yellow and 1 red signal only) and few typical signal patterns (1 yellow, 1 red, and 1 green signal) in a smaller population of  tumor cells. The RNA sequencing showed a recently described DES-ALK fusion transcript in the tumor cells, suggesting an intrachromosomal inversion and deletion as the likely underlying mechanism for the atypical FISH pattern. Familiarity with the unusual morphology and atypical FISH pattern is crucial given that this tumor has an activating ALK rearrangement and may benefit from targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the future.",ALK,1

Local therapies have the principal  role, especially in symptomatic patients. Advances in surgery and radiation therapy manage considerable local control. Systemic treatments have shown effect  in clinical trials and in real life clinical settings; yet, at present, this is restricted to patients with asymptomatic or stable intracranial lesions. Targeted agents can have a benefit only in patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement. Immunotherapy has shown impressive results in patients with PD-L1  expression in tumor cells. Its effects can be further enhanced by a synergy with  radiotherapy, possibly by increasing the percentage of responders. The present review summarizes the need for more effective systemic treatments, so that the increased intracranial control achieved by local treatments can be translated in  an increase in overall survival.",ALK,1

We have analyzed the clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with inadequate tumor samples for tissue genotyping. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted the study in a multi-institutional prospective cohort of clinically unselected patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinomas with insufficient tissue for EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genotyping across 12 Spanish institutions (n = 93). ctDNA NGS was carried out by Guardant Health (Guardant360, Redwood City, CA), using a hybrid-capture-based 73-gene panel. Variants were deemed actionable if they were part of the OncoKB precision oncology knowledge database and classified in four levels of actionability based on their clinical or preclinical evidence for drug response. RESULTS: Eighty-three out of 93 patients (89%) had detectable levels of ctDNA. Potentially actionable level 1-4 genomic alterations were detected in 53 cases (57%), of which 13 (14%) had level 1-2A alterations (Food and Drug Administration-approved and standard-care biomarkers according to lung cancer guidelines). Frequencies of each genomic alteration in ctDNA were consistent with those observed in unselected pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The majority of the patients (62%), particularly those with actionable alterations (87%), had more than one pathogenic variant in ctDNA. The median turnaround time to genomic results was 13 days. Twelve patients (13%) received genotype-matched therapies based on ctDNA results, deriving the expected clinical benefit. Patients with co-occurring pathogenic alterations had a significantly shorter median overall survival as compared with patients without co-occurring pathogenic alteration (multivariate hazard ratio = 5.35, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Digital NGS of ctDNA in lung cancers with insufficient tumor samples  for tissue sequencing detects actionable variants that frequently co-occur with other potentially clinically relevant genomic alterations, allowing timely initiation of genotype-matched therapies.  © The Author(s) 2018.

Approximately 6.7% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) show  anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement and could benefit from ALK-targeted treatment. Various anti-ALK drugs have been developed during the past years, but it is actually controversial which sequence and which ALK inhibitor is recommended for a single patient. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is associated with a poor prognosis, with an overall survival of 2-4 months for treated patients. The data about LC management derive mainly from retrospective studies, being an exclusion criterion for most trials. Intrathecal chemotherapy and whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), associated with a systemic treatment, are the most commonly used approach. Here we present a case of NSCLC harboring an ALK translocation treated with four lines of ALK inhibitors and receiving WBRT for LC, showing an overall survival of ∼5 years from the diagnosis of metastatic disease. This case report focuses mainly on several controversial clinical aspects, that is, the sequence of treatment in ALK-positive NSCLC, the ALK inhibitors' efficacy on brain disease and beyond progression, the management of LC, and the role of WBRT despite the risk of cognitive impairment.",ALK,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total 307 cases were submitted for EGFR mutational analysis and 265 cases for ALK analysis. The cytological specimen sources included lung, lymph node, liver, bone, adrenal gland, mesentery mass, and body fluids/bronchial brushing. EGFR mutations in the exons 18 to 21 were analyzed with Qiagen EGFR Pyro Kits. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies for ALK rearrangement inv(2)(p21; p23) were performed on the paraffin-embedded cell block sections utilizing dual-color Vysis LSI ALK Break Apart Probe Kit. RESULTS: Among 307 fine needle aspirate cases for EGFR analysis, 302 cases (269 from cell blocks, 33 from direct smears) had sufficient material for EGFR test. Five cases failed due to inadequate cellularity. Twenty six of 302 (8.6%) cases were positive for EGFR mutations. A total of 265 cases submitted for ALK analysis included 240 cases of fine needle aspirate, 25 cases of pleural fluid/pericardial fluid/bronchial washings. Eight cases failed because of low cellularity, whereas  257 of 265 cases had sufficient material for ALK FISH study. Nine of 257 cases (3.5%) revealed ALK rearrangement by FISH. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that cytological specimens can yield  sufficient material for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangement test.

In recent years,  molecular testing has been developed to study genetic mutations in NSCLC. There are studies revealing improved survival in advanced NSCLC using targeted therapy  as the first-line treatment in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adequacy of EBUS-TBNA in providing adequate size specimens for EGFR, ALK and ROS1 genetic mutation analysis in patients with adenocarcinoma or not otherwise specified (NOS) lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Charts of patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma or NOS via EBUS-TBNA were retrospectively reviewed. Information on patient demographics, number of lymph nodes sampled, their size and location, targeted gene mutations and the adequacy of the material sampled for the molecular testing was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included in the study, adenocarcinoma 86 (75%) and NOS 28 (25%). EGFR gene mutation was studied in all of the patients included in the study while ALK in 113 and ROS1 in 98. The material adequacy ratios for EGFR gene mutation, ALK and ROS1 rearrangements were found to be 88.6%, 93.8% and 91.8%, respectively.

Epub 2018 Dec 1.,Safety issues with the ALK inhibitors in the treatment of NSCLC: A systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the chromosomal rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were associated with superior clinical outcome. Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are known to have peculiar toxicity profile, hence, increasing awareness to the safety profile of ALK inhibitors is essential. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review of literature has been conducted to include prospective trials that used the ALK inhibitors Crizotinib, Ceritinib, Alectinib, Brigatinib and Lorlatinib in patients with advanced NSCLC and have available efficacy and toxicity results. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies including 2793 patients were considered eligible for our review and included two phase IB, seven phase II and five phase III studies. The most common adverse events (AEs) observed with ALK inhibitors were gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities as nausea (up to 83%), vomiting (up to 67%) and  diarrhea (up to 86%), elevation of liver enzymes occurred in up to 60% and fatigue (up to 43%). There were differences in the toxicity patterns between the  different ALK inhibitors with more GI and hepatic toxicities with Ceritinib, more visual disorders with Crizotinib, more dysgeusia with crizotinib and Alectinib and possibly more respiratory complications with Brigatinib. Most of the AEs were low grade and treatment-related deaths were associated with ALK inhibitors in 0-1% of patients. CONCLUSION: Most of adverse effects of ALKi can be managed efficiently via dose modifications or interruptions. Timely identification of each ALKi pattern of toxicity can prevent treatment-related morbidity and mortality in this palliative setting.",ALK,1

Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 (STK1 or  FLK2), AXL (UFO or JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246). Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3 signalling in cells expressing FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), tyrosine kinase domain mutation FLT3-D835Y and the double mutant FLT3-ITD-D835Y, thereby inducing apoptosis. Gilteritinib also binds to and inhibits the wild-type and mutated forms of ALK, resulting in reduced tumour cell proliferation in cancer cell types that overexpress the mutation. Gilteritinib is approved in Japan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation. Recently, it was also approved in the USA for the treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory AML with a FLT3 mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. Clinical development of gilteritinib is underway in several countries worldwide. Development for non-small cell lung cancer and solid tumours has been discontinued.",ALK,1

A critical limitation of conventional ALK/ROS TKIs is their association with acquired resistance mutations (particularly ALK G1202R and ROS1 G2032R) in the ALK or ROS1 gene, although these are not the only resistance  mechanisms. Another limitation of this class of drugs is their inadequate efficacy against central nervous system metastasis, likely attributable to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, lorlatinib was developed to overcome these  limitations by being more potent, selective and permeable to the BBB than previous-generation ALK/ROS1 TKIs and subsequently received breakthrough therapy  designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2017. In September 2018, Japan became the first country where lorlatinib received approval for treating patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer. Eventually, the FDA approved lorlatinib (Lorbrena; Pfizer) in November 2018. Lorlatinib use is expected to increase in importance, owing to its promising efficacy in clinical trials.",ALK,1

However, leptomeningeal metastases (LM) are frequent  and often devastating complications of ALK-rearranged NSCLC, and treatment against LM remains challenging. Herein we report a case of a 19-year-old male diagnosed with ALK-rearranged NSCLC with LM. He experienced heavy treatment before introduction of alectinib therapy, which continued for approximately 5.5 years with marked efficacy. However, he experienced recurrence of a bulbar metastasis after discontinuation of alectinib. Reintroduction of standard-dose alectinib therapy resolved the lesion again. Our findings suggest that ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy should be continued in patients showing a long-term complete response, unless intolerable toxicities are present, and that  rechallenge treatment with alectinib may represent a therapeutic option for central nervous system metastases.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,Exploration of germline variants responsible for adverse events of crizotinib in  anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small cell lung cancer by target-gene panel sequencing.,"OBJECTIVES: Crizotinib is a standard treatment for advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)- or ROS1-fusion-gene-positive non-small cell lung cancer; however, serious adverse events (AEs), including elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and interstitial lung disease (ILD), develop occasionally. Here, we evaluated relationships between clinically significant crizotinib-associated AEs and germline variations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA obtained from 75 patients allowed selection of 147 genes according to function, exon identification and sequencing, and determination of germline single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Correlations between clinically significant AEs and presence of germline variants were estimated by Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: We defined clinically significant AEs as grade 4 hematological toxicity, grade ≥3 non-hematological toxicity, and any grade of ILD. These AEs were observed in 26 patients (35%), with elevated AST/ALT (15%) the most common, followed by neutropenia (5%), ILD (4%), and thromboembolic events (4%). Nonsynonymous SNVs in epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) [odds ratio (OR): 3.86; p = 0.0009) and transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) (OR: 2.51; p = 0.025) were associated with the presence of clinically significant AEs. CONCLUSION: Nonsynonymous EPHX1 and TCF7L2 SNVs might be associated with clinically significant crizotinib-associated AEs. These data indicated that target-gene sequencing could be feasible for predicting anticancer-agent toxicity, and that germline multi-gene information might be useful for predicting patient-specific AEs to promote precision medicine.",ALK,1

In recent years, following the emergence of high-throughput sequencing techniques, rearrangements in genes, such as ALK, ROS1, NTRK, RET, and PDGFRβ, have been detected in a considerable proportion of IMT patients. However, the practice of targeted therapy for those patients remains extremely limited. In this study, we report about a 14-year-old  boy diagnosed with pulmonary IMT with a mass measuring 12 × 8 cm in the right lower lobe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay and comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed on the biopsied tumor tissue. RESULTS: The IHC assay revealed an ALK-negative tumor, while NGS detected aTFG-ROS1 rearrangement. The patient achieved continuous remission after treatment with crizotinib (250 mg, bid). CONCLUSION: This case broadens the experience regarding targeted therapy forROS1-rearranged IMT and supports the use of broad molecular profiling testing  for optimizing therapeutic options.",ALK,1

Epub 2019  Jan 21., ALK phosphorylates SMAD4 on tyrosine to disable TGF-β tumour suppressor,"Loss of TGF-β tumour suppressive response is a hallmark of human cancers. As a central player in TGF-β signal transduction, SMAD4 (also known as DPC4) is frequently mutated or deleted in gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancer. However, such genetic alterations are rare in most cancer types and the underlying mechanism for TGF-β resistance is not understood. Here we describe a mechanism of TGF-β resistance in ALK-positive tumours, including lymphoma, lung cancer and neuroblastoma. We demonstrate that, in ALK-positive tumours, ALK directly phosphorylates SMAD4 at Tyr 95. Phosphorylated SMAD4 is unable to bind to DNA and fails to elicit TGF-β gene responses and tumour suppressing responses. Chemical or genetic interference of the oncogenic ALK restores TGF-β responses in ALK-positive tumour cells. These findings reveal that SMAD4 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by an oncogenic tyrosine kinase during tumorigenesis. This suggests a mechanism by which SMAD4 is inactivated in cancers and provides guidance for targeted therapies in ALK-positive cancers.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Dec 20., Anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusions: Roles in cancer and therapeutic perspectives.,"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) serves a crucial  role in brain development. ALK is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p23) and exchange of chromosomal segments with other genes, including nucleophosmin (NPM), echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) and Trk-fused gene (TFG), readily occurs. Such chromosomal translocation results in the formation of chimeric X-ALK fusion oncoproteins, which possess potential oncogenic functions due to constitutive activation of ALK kinase. These proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies and solid tumors, including lymphoma, lung cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs), Spitz tumors,  renal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, digestive tract cancer, breast cancer, leukemia  and ovarian carcinoma. Targeting of ALK fusion oncoproteins exclusively, or in combination with ALK kinase inhibitors including crizotinib, is the most common therapeutic strategy. As is often the case for small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), drug resistance eventually develops via an adaptive secondary  mutation in the ALK fusion oncogene, or through engagement of alternative signaling mechanisms. The updated mechanisms of a variety of ALK fusions in tumorigenesis, proliferation and metastasis, in addition to targeted therapies are discussed below.",ALK,1

MET exon 14 skipping is a rare mutation typically found in older, female, and non-smoking patients with NSCLC. Herein, we report the case of a 71-year-old non-smoking woman who was diagnosed with NSCLC in the left lung. EGFR mutation and ALK fusion were not detected. Because the biopsy specimen showed high PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score of 95%, pembrolizumab was introduced as first-line therapy, but  resulted in no clinical benefit. The patient was subsequently administered chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed, leading to remarkable tumor shrinkage. A next-generation sequencing panel analysis revealed a MET exon 14 skipping mutation. Thus, pembrolizumab might not be effective for NSCLC patients  with MET exon 14 skipping mutations, even if PD-L1 expression is high.",ALK,1

METHODS: We selected 168 NSCLC patients with MPE. We extracted MPE and enriched tumor cells using a custom-designed device. EGFR mutations and ALK/ROS1 fusions were then detected by quantitative real-time PCR, and the results were used to guide targeted therapy. We investigated drug responses through imaging. RESULTS: MPE tumor cells were detected in all patients. EGFR mutations and ALK/ROS1 rearrangements were detected in biopsy samples, treated MPE, and untreated MPE. We found that treated MPE had higher sensitivity and specificity than biopsy or untreated MPE. Among the 26 EGFR inhibitor patients, 13 showed a partial response, 7 had progressive disease, and 6 showed stable disease. Among the 16 patients that received ALK/ROS1 inhibitors, 8 had a partial response, 4 had progressive disease, and 4 showed stable disease. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a new, less invasive, and highly repeatable method of analyzing MPE tumor cells in NSCLC that facilitates precision medicine and genetic testing.",ALK,1

We aimed to evaluate the exhaustiveness of the ROR-Sul database, covering around 4.8 million inhabitants. We have used a retrospective cohort study comprising 3457 lung cancer cases diagnosed during 2014 and 2015 and extracted from ROR-Sul database. Descriptive analysis of missing data was undertaken using IBM SPSS software, v.24. Exhaustiveness of data registry was classified into high (missing values <1%), medium (missing values {1-15%}) or low (missing values > 15%). High exhaustiveness was found for patients demographic information, date of diagnosis, date of first medical appointment, topography, morphology, cancer differentiation, stage of disease and surgery procedure. Medium exhaustiveness was found for biomarkers (ALK, KRAS, and EGFR) results, and immunotherapy regimens. Low exhaustiveness was found for performance status, chemotherapy regimen, and chemotherapy treatment response. The findings highlight the need to transform treatment variables into compulsory, so that the cancer registry may be used to support effectiveness studies.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a sensitive and specific method to detect ALK protein expression, possibly an alternative to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, the concordance of FISH and IHC to determine ALK status was evaluated, particularly focusing on discordant cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ALK status was tested by FISH and the IHC validated method (Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay) in 95 NSCLCs. Discordant cases were analyzed also  by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The response to crizotinib of treated patients was recorded. RESULTS: Seven (7.3%) discordant cases were ALK FISH positive and IHC negative. They showed coexistent split signals pattern, with mean percentage of 15.4%, and  5' deletions pattern, with mean percentage 31.7%. Two cases had also gene amplification pattern. In three cases (42.8 %), the polysomy was observed. The NGS assay confirmed IHC results. In these patients, the treatment with crizotinib was ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: In our discordant cases, a coexistent complex pattern (deleted, split, and amplified/polysomic) of ALK gene was observed by FISH analysis. These  complex rearranged cases were not detectable by IHC, and it could be speculated that more complex biological mechanisms could modulate protein expression. These  data highlight the role of IHC and underscore the complexity of the genetic pattern of ALK. It could be crucial to consider these findings in order to best select patients for anti-ALK treatment in daily clinical practice.",ALK,1

We describe the first reported case of accelerated NSCLC tumor extension throughout  the entire spinal epidural space. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 68-year-old woman with stage IV ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC presented with acute neck pain, urinary retention, and lower extremity weakness 15 days post discontinuation of alectinib. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with  contrast was significant for a new compressive lesion spanning the entire cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, which was new compared with MRI obtained 20 days before and was suspicious for infection. Cervical (C3-C7), thoracic (T9-T12), and lumbar (L3-L5) decompression were performed with collection of culture and pathology specimens. Repeat MRI obtained for acute neurologic deterioration on postoperative day 2 noted further progression of disease and continued thoracic cord compression. After urgent T1-9 laminectomy, specimens were again sent for pathology, cultures, and cytology. No evidence of infection was noted, and all pathologic specimens evaluated were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Despite operative intervention, the patient continued to decline, suffering from recurrent pleural effusions, and eventual cardiopulmonary arrest 11 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: The differential diagnosis when evaluating presumed spine epidural abscess should include tumor and metastatic disease, even in cases of rapid development. Recent termination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or ALK inhibitors may result in severe disease flares, and a history of such should raise clinical  suspicion for metastatic progression. In addition to cultures, biopsy for pathologic diagnosis should be collected during decompressive surgery.",ALK,1

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether tumor mutation status (EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1,  and BRAF) and treatment history were associated with survival after neurosurgery. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic health records of 104 patients with NSCLC with genomic profiling who underwent neurosurgical resection for symptomatic brain metastases at an academic institution between January 2000 and January 2018. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate the association between overall survival (OS) after neurosurgery and clinicopathologic factors, including mutation status. RESULTS: Mean age of patients in this study was 61 (±12) years, and 44% were men. The median OS after neurosurgery was 24 months (95% confidence interval, 18-34 months). Our multivariate analysis showed that the presence of an EGFR mutation in the tumor was significantly associated with improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.214; P = 0.029), independent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor use. Presence of KRAS, ALK, ROS1, and BRAF alterations was not associated with survival (all P > 0.05). Conversely, older age (HR, 1.039; P = 0.029), a history of multiple brain  irradiation procedures (HR, 9.197; P < 0.001), and presence of extracranial metastasis (HR, 2.556; P = 0.016) resulted in increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients requiring surgical resection of an epidermal growth factor  receptor-mutated NSCLC brain metastasis had an associated improved survival compared with patients without this mutation, independent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor use. Decreased survival was associated with older age, multiple previous brain radiation therapies, and extracranial metastasis.",ALK,1

Crizotinib is very effective in ROS1-positive patients and is now Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC. We report our experience in a tertiary cancer care hospital in India in ROS-1 positive patients. Materials and method: The present series is a retrospective analysis of 22 patients from the prospectively maintained lung cancer audit. Demographic data were collected which included age, performance status, gender, stage, co-morbidities, sites of metastasis and smoking history. Data were also collected regarding the source of financing for crizotinib whether self-financed, through insurance or Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) sponsored. Patients who had tested negative for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and were subsequently found to be ROS1-mutation negative by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were evaluated on similar lines. All the data were entered and statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 22.0. Response evaluation was done by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Results: Between January 2015 and December 2017, there were 22 patients who were  ROS1 positive from a total of 535 patients in whom ROS1 testing was performed. A  total of 16 patients could receive crizotinib and 6 patients were never exposed to crizotinib. Among the 16 patients who received crizotinib, 2 (12.5%) achieved  complete response (CR) as their best response and continue to remain in CR at follow-up. 13 (81%) had a partial response as best response and of which on follow-up 5 (38%) have progressed, while 8 (62%) continue to maintain response. The patients who were on crizotinib had good tolerance with none experiencing any grade 3/4 toxicity. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 15.2 months in  ROS1-positive cohort and 11.4 months in ROS1-negative cohort. In ROS1-positive cohort median, progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached and the estimated  2-year PFS was 54% and in ROS1-negative cohort, it was 5.1 months. The median overall survival of the entire ROS1-positive cohort was not reached and the estimated 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) was 72% and 54%, respectively, and  was 8.8 months in ROS1-negative cohort. Conclusion: ROS1 rearrangement with an incidence of 4% of lung adenocarcinoma which is EGFR and ALK negative represents an important targetable driver mutation in the Indian population. Crizotinib also represents an effective treatment option with outcomes similar to those reported. Access to treatment remains an important roadblock to improve outcomes but innovative methods may improve access to these drugs.",ALK,1

A Meta-Analysis of Five Randomized Trials.,"Background and objectives: Targeted therapy is widely used in the era of precision medicine. Whether the sequence in which targeted therapy and chemotherapy are performed matters, is however not known. We examined the impact  of the sequential treatment of targeted therapy and chemotherapy among advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Materials and Methods: Randomized controlled trials comparing the use of ALK inhibitors with chemotherapy were included in this meta-analysis. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from a random effects model. Two-sided statistical tests were used to determine the significance of these estimates. Results: In five eligible studies (1404 patients), ALK targeted therapy, in comparison with chemotherapy, had a significantly higher PFS (HR = 0.48; 95% CI,  0.42⁻0.55), but not significantly higher OS (HR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.72⁻1.07). Crossover from chemotherapy to ALK inhibitors was allowed after progression in all trials. The sensitivity analysis of the use of ALK inhibitors as either the first- or second-line treatment, showed improvements in PFS but not in OS. Conclusions: Our results indicate that using targeted therapy first improved PFS, but that the sequence in which the treatments were performed did not cause a significant difference in overall survival.",ALK,1

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment was an independent risk factor for prognose of these patients (P=0.024). Conclusions: Lung adenosquamous carcinoma is a rare subtype with high malignancy and poor prognosis. Early diagnosis and driven-mutation-based individualized therapy may improve the survival of patients with lung adenosquamous carcinoma.",ALK,1

We analysed all stage-IV ALK+ NSCLC patients with longitudinally assessable TP53 status treated in our institutions (n = 62). Patients with TP53 mutations at baseline (TP53mutbas, n = 23) had worse overall survival (OS) than patients with initially wild-type tumours (TP53wtbas, n = 39, 44 vs. 62 months in median, p = 0.018). Within the generally favourable TP53wtbas group, detection of TP53 mutations at progression defined a converted subgroup (TP53mutconv, n = 9) with inferior OS, similar to that of TP53mutbas and shorter than that of patients remaining TP53 wild-type (TP53wtprogr, 45 vs. 94 months, p = 0.043). Progression-free survival (PFS) under treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for TP53mutconv was comparable to that of TP53mutbas and also shorter than that of TP53wtprogr cases  (5 and 8 vs. 13 months, p = 0.0039). Fewer TP53wtprogr than TP53mutbas or TP53mutconv cases presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis (67% vs. 91% or  100%, p < 0.05). Thus, acquisition of TP53 mutations at progression is associated with more aggressive disease, shorter TKI responses and inferior OS in ALK+ NSCLC, comparable to primary TP53 mutated cases.",ALK,1

METHODS: We developed the NanoVelcro Chip integrating three functional mechanisms. NanoVelcro CTC capture efficiency was tested in stage III or IV lung  adenocarcinoma. Further, ALK-rearrangement status was examined through fluorescent in situ hybridization in CTCs enriched by NanoVelcro. RESULTS: NanoVelcro system showed higher CTC-capture efficiency than CellSearch in stage III or IV lung adenocarcinoma. CTC counts obtained by both methods were  positively correlated (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). Further, Correlation between CTC counts and pTNM stage determined by NanoVelcro was more significant than that determined by CellSearch (p < 0.001 VS p = 0.029). All ALK-positive patients had  3 or more ALK-rearranged CTC per ml of blood. Less than 3 ALK-rearranged CTC was  detected in ALK-negative patients. NanoVelcro can detect the ALK-rearranged status with consistent sensitivity and specificity compared to biopsy test. Furthermore, the ALK-rearranged CTC ratio correlated to the pTNM stage in ALK-positive patients. Following up showed that CTCs counting by NanoVelcro was more stable and reliable in evaluating the efficacy of Clozotinib both in the short and long run compared with CellSearch. Changing of NanoVlecro CTC counts could accurately reflect disease progression. CONCLUSION: NanoVelcro provides a sensitive method for CTC counts and characterization in advanced NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement can be detected in CTCs collected from advanced NSCLC patients by NanoVelcro, facilitating diagnostic test and prognosis analysis, most importantly offering one noninvasive method for real-time monitoring of treatment reaction.",ALK,1

Nonetheless tumour consists of heterogeneous cell subpopulations  with diverse phenotypes and genotypes, and cancer cells can actively release extracellular vesicles (EVs) to modulate the phenotype of other cells in the tumour microenvironment. We hypothesized that EVs derived from a drug-resistant subpopulation of cells could induce drug resistance in recipient cells. We have established ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and subclones. The subclones have been characterized and the expression of EV-RNAs determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effects of EV transfer on drug resistance were examined in vitro. Serum EV-RNA was assayed serially in two patients prescribed ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ALK-TKI) treatment. We demonstrated that the EVs from an ALK-TKI-resistant subclone could induce drug resistance in the originally sensitive subclone. EV-RNA profiling revealed that miRNAs miR-21-5p and miR-486-3p, and lncRNAs MEG3 and XIST were differentially expressed in the EVs secreted by the resistant subclones. These circulating EV-RNA levels have been found to correlate with disease progression of EML4-ALK-translocated lung adenocarcinoma in patients prescribed ALK-TKI treatment. The results from this study suggest that EVs released by a drug-resistant subpopulation can induce drug resistance in other subpopulations and may sustain intratumoural heterogeneity.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Nov 4., Frequency and clinical significance of NF1 mutation in lung adenocarcinomas from  East Asian patients.,"NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates Ras signaling. NF1 deficiency plays an important role in carcinogenesis. To investigate the frequency and clinical significance of NF1 mutation, we examined mutation status  of NF1, TP53, LKB1 and RB1 in 704 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas from East Asian patients using semiconductor-based Ion Torrent sequencing platform. Common driver events, including mutations in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, MET, and fusions affecting ALK, RET and ROS1, were also concurrently detected. The correlation between NF1 mutations and clinicomolecular features of patients was further evaluated. Among 704 patients, 42 NF1 mutations were found in 33 patients (33/704, 4.7%), including 14 patients harboring EGFR/NF1 comutations (14/33, 42.4%). Comparing with EGFR-mutant patients, patients harboring NF1 mutations were closely associated with solid component subtype (p = 0.028). Comparing with  KRAS mutations, NF1 mutations were found more common in female and never smokers  (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed  that patients harboring NF1 mutation had similar disease-free survival (DFS) and  overall survival (OS) with patients with KRAS mutation. Although frequently overlapped with EGFR mutation, patients harboring NF1 mutation had significantly  shorter DFS (p = 0.019) and OS (p = 0.004) than patients with EGFR mutation. During follow-up, one female patient with EGFR exon 19 deletion and NF1 Q1815X comutation showed poor response to EGFR TKIs (Gefitinib and Osimertinib) after disease relapse. In conclusion, NF1 mutations define a unique molecular and clinicopathologic subtype of lung adenocarcinoma. Examination of NF1 mutation may contribute to molecular subtyping and therapeutic intervention of lung adenocarcinoma.",ALK,1

Recent years have seen advances in mutational analysis and genomics profiling. These advances could improve accuracy of diagnosis of CUPs and might improve the prognosis of patients with CUPs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year old male with an adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin in the lung presented with another tumor of the palate mucosa. The tumor cells in the pleural effusion were all negative for immunohistochemical markers (TTF-1 and Napsin A) and lung-specific oncogenic driver alterations (EGFR mutation and ALK translocation). The tumor of the palate mucosa was likewise identified as an adenocarcinoma, and the cells showed cytological similarities with the tumor cells in the pleural effusion; TTF-1, Napsin A, EGFR mutation and  ALK translocation were all negative. This result suggested that origins of the tumors of the palate mucosa and in the lung were the same, even though the origin had not yet been determined. Next, we addressed whether the tumor of the palate mucosa was a primary tumor or not. Secretory carcinoma (SC), which is a common type of minor salivary gland tumor (MSGT), was suspected; however, mammaglobin was negative and ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) fusion was not observed. Other MSGTs were excluded based on histological and immunohistochemical findings. Furthermore, an  additional examination demonstrated an oncogenic KRAS mutation at codon 12 (p.G12D) in both palate tumor and in pleural effusion. KRAS mutation is known to  exist in one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs), but quite rare in MSGTs. The  possibility of metastasis from other organs was considered unlikely from the results of endoscopic and imaging studies. This result indicated that the primary site of the CUP was indeed the lung, and that the tumor of the palate mucosa was  a metastasis of the LUAD. CONCLUSIONS: A tumor of the palate mucosa that showed diagnostic difficulties was determined to be a metastatic LUAD by genomic alterations and histopathological findings.",ALK,1

We herein evaluated 22C3-PD-L1 expression of NSCLC in a single institution experience and compared it with clinicopathologic features. Materials and methods: We assessed 22C3-PD-L1 expressions of 411 patients with NSCLC from our institution, including in past specimens. Programmed death-ligand  1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing was performed using the PD-L1 clone 22C3 pharmDx kit (Agilent Technologies/Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Patients were separated into 3 groups with <1% (no expression), 1% to 49% (low expression), or  ⩾50% (high expression) positive tumor cells. Results: In all, 137 patients (33%) did not express PD-L1, 155 (38%) showed low expression, and 119 (29%) demonstrated high expression. Archival samples showed lower PD-L1 expression than that of recent samples, and the ratios of no expression case significantly increased by using paraffin blocks embedded particularly in more than 4 years ago. Programmed death-ligand 1 positivity was significantly associated with male sex, smoking, higher tumor grade, squamous cell carcinoma in histologic type, wild-type EGFR, and ALK rearrangement positive. Conclusions: The rate of 22C3-PD-L1 expression of NSCLC detected in this study was similar to the frequencies of the previous reports, although the ratio of expression case decreased when using old paraffin blocks.",ALK,1

They have achieved better results in prolonging the progression free survival and improving quality of life in comparison to chemotherapy. We have assembled the evidence related to the efficacy and safety of these agents in the  treatment of ALK positive NSCLC. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using electronic databases of PubMed, Medline and Cochrane Library  to identify the studies involving comparison of ALK inhibitors to chemotherapy and Next generation ALK inhibitors to crizotinib. PFS was the primary outcome while other outcomes like ORR, adverse events, quality of life and OS were also analyzed and compared. Hazard ratios and odds ratios obtained were analyzed using fixed effect or random effects model in Review Manager Software. Results: A total of 12 studies (n = 3,297) met the criteria for inclusion in this review and meta-analysis. ALK inhibitors including crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib revealed significantly better PFS (HR 0.42 [0.35, 0.50; p < 0.00001]), ORR (Overall OR 6.59 [4.86, 8.94; p < 0.00001] as compared to chemotherapy in the first line as well as second line treatment settings. Intracranial response rate  was better with ALK inhibitors (ceritinib and alectinib) as compared to chemotherapy OR 6.51 [2.86, 14.83; p < 0.00001]. No significant increase in grade 3 or 4 adverse events was observed with crizotinib (OR 1.21 [0.82, 1.77; p = 0.34]) or ceritinib (OR 1.49 [0.86, 2.57; p = 0.17]) when compared to chemotherapy individually. Quality of life indicators assessed were significantly improved with ALK inhibitors. Next generation agents (ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib) revealed significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.50 [0.43, 0.57; p < 0.00001]), ORR (OR 1.57 [1.21, 2.04; p = 0.0006]) in comparison to crizotinib. Next generation agents (Alectinib and brigatinib) yielded better response intra-cranially than crizotinib in terms of objective response rate (OR 5.87 [3.49, 9.87; p < 0.00001]) and time to CNS progression (HR 0.25 [0.13, 0.46; p <  0.0001]). Alectinib by far resulted in fewer adverse events than chemotherapy or  crizotinib. Conclusions: Overall ALK inhibitors are safe and effective treatment  option in ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer. Of the ALK inhibitors, Next generation agents in particular alectinib and brigatinib are safer and more effective intra-cranially and can be preferred as first option.",ALK,1

Methods: Twenty-four cases of PMEC and 44 adenosqumous carcinoma diagnosed in the Guangdong General Hospital were tested for MAML2 translocation by fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) using tissue array. An  IHC panel including TTF1, Napsin A, CK5/6, p63, p40 and Ki-67 was performed on the cohort. The clinical data for all cases were collected and all PMEC patients  had follow-up information. Results: The patients' age ranged form 6 to 73 years,  with a median age of 32 years. The male to female ratio was 1.4∶1.0. MAML2 translocation was found in 16/24 (66.7%) cases of PMEC whereas all 44 cases adenosqumous carcinoma were negative for translocation. All the cases of the PMEC were negative for TTF1 and Napsin A but positive for CK5/6, p63 and p40 in the intermediate cells and epidermal-like cells. In most PMEC cases, the Ki-67 expression index was lower than 10%. In contrast, most cases of adenosqumous carcinomas expressed TTF1 and Napsin A in the adenomatous component and CK5/6, p63 and p40 in the squamous component, which expression pattern was different from that of PMEC. Based on IHC staining, 2 cases of highly invasive ALK-positive adenocarcinoma mimicing PMEC were also found in the study. Conclusions: MAML2 gene translocation can be detected in about two-third of PMEC. Translocation of MAML2 gene and lower morphology grading are associated with good prognosis. The combined use of IHC antibodies panel is helpful to distinguish PMEC from the adenosqumous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma mimicing PMEC.",ALK,1

Epub 2019 May 17., Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Sequencing Agents in the EGFR-Mutated/ALK-Rearranged Populations.,"Personalized therapy based on actionable molecular markers has completely transformed the therapeutic landscape in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In less than 15 years, multiple molecular targets, led by EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), have been identified, and myriad oral tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now available to target these oncogenic drivers, with the expectation that the majority of patients will respond to treatment and  that progression-free survival (PFS) will exceed 10 to 30 months, far better than we observed historically with chemotherapy alone. As a result, prognosis has improved dramatically in this subset of patients. Osimertinib has largely displaced first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib, in the management of EGFR-mutated NSCLC. PFS now exceeds 18 months, and central nervous system penetrance is enhanced. Dacomitinib has the distinction of being the first EGFR TKI to demonstrate a survival advantage compared with older TKIs. Recent data suggest therapeutic additivity, if not synergy, for the concurrent use of chemotherapy, as well as monoclonal antibodies targeting angiogenesis, with EGFR TKIs. Alectinib and brigatinib, very specific ALK inhibitors, have proven superior to the erstwhile standard crizotinib in treatment-naive ALK+ NSCLC; PFS now routinely exceeds 2 to 3 years. In addition,  these newer agents have far superior central nervous system penetration. As a result, many patients with ALK+ advanced NSCLC with brain metastases, even some who are symptomatic, can defer or indefinitely avoid brain irradiation. Mechanisms of resistance in ALK are complicated, with multiple new agents being developed in this arena. Although many patients with molecular targets can reasonably expect to live 5 years or more, the emergence of molecular resistance  is virtually inevitable. In this regard, systemic platinum-based chemotherapy is  the final common therapeutic pathway for virtually all patients with oncogenic drivers. Standard regimens include pemetrexed and carboplatin, as well as the E4599 regimen, combination solvent-based paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab. Checkpoint inhibitors, as single agents, have not yielded much benefit, even in those with high levels of PD-L1 expression. However, in a subanalysis of patients with ALK and EGFR mutations enrolled in IMpower150, the addition of atezolizumab to the E4599 regimen led to a major overall survival benefit (hazard ratio < 0.40). In the absence of systemic chemotherapy, combining checkpoint inhibitors with TKIs in this setting remains investigational; several  studies have demonstrated untoward pulmonary and hepatic toxicity.",ALK,1

The clinical and molecular characteristics of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) associated with ALK rearrangement are still unclear. Herein, we assessed the ALK status in a series of patients with LCNEC by testing methods commonly used for adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ALK expression was first examined by immunohistochemistry. For a positively stained tumor, molecular analyses were then conducted. The ALK fusion partner found in a patient with ALK rearrangement was further identified by direct DNA sequencing. Patient clinicopathological features were also analyzed, focusing on the ALK rearrangement-positive case. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry of seven patients identified strong ALK expression  in one case of stage IV LCNEC. Molecular analysis identified a novel rearranged gene resulting from the fusion of kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) exon 17 to ALK exon 20. The patient was treated with ALK-specific inhibitors, crizotinib and later, alectinib, and has remained alive for more than 24 months without disease  progression. Three of the remaining six patients without ALK rearrangement had stage IV cancer and received cytotoxic chemotherapies. Their average overall survival was 5.4 months. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a KIF5B-ALK fusion gene in LCNEC. The patient was successfully treated with ALK inhibitors, suggesting that sensitivity to ALK inhibitor may define a specific LCNEC subtype. We propose that screening for ALK rearrangement in patients with LCNEC may assist in selecting potential candidates for targeted therapy.",ALK,1

This phase II study investigated efficacy and safety of the HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with previously treated advanced HER2-overexpressing NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had HER2-overexpressing NSCLC (centrally  tested IHC) and received previous platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy in the case of EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement. Patients were divided into cohorts based on HER2 IHC (2+, 3+). All patients received T-DM1 3.6  mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was investigator-determined overall response rate  (ORR) using RECIST v1.1. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients received T-DM1 (29 IHC 2+, 20 IHC 3+). No treatment  responses were observed in the IHC 2+ cohort. Four partial responses were observed in the IHC 3+ cohort (ORR, 20%; 95% confidence interval, 5.7%-43.7%). Clinical benefit rates were 7% and 30% in the IHC 2+ and 3+ cohorts, respectively. Response duration for the responders was 2.9, 7.3, 8.3, and 10.8 months. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were similar between cohorts. Three of 4 responders had HER2 gene amplification. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: T-DM1 showed a signal of activity in patients with HER2-overexpressing (IHC 3+) advanced NSCLC. Additional investigation into HER2 pathway alterations is needed to refine the target population for T-DM1 in NSCLC; however, HER2 IHC as a single parameter was an insufficient predictive biomarker.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Oct 11., Molecular Diagnostic Assays and Clinicopathologic Implications of MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutation in Non-small-cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies revealed MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) as a biomarker that predicts the response to MET inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, METex14 genomic alterations exhibit a highly diverse sequence composition, posing a challenge for clinical diagnostic testing. This study aimed to find a reasonable diagnostic assay for METex14 and identify its clinicopathologic implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of METex14 in 414 EGFR/KRAS/ALK/ROS1-negative (quadruple negative) surgically resected NSCLCs. We used real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing for the first assay, followed by next-generation  sequencing (NGS; hybrid-capture targeted DNA/RNA sequencing). Clinicopathologic implications of the METex14 group were analyzed in a total of 880 NSCLCs. RESULTS: METex14 was confirmed in 13 (3.1%) patients by DNA- and RNA-NGS. After comparison of assay results, qRT-PCR and NGS demonstrated the highest concordance rate. The mean variant allele frequency was 10.5% and 49% in DNA- and RNA-NGS, respectively. DNA-NGS revealed various lengths of indel and substitutions around  and in exon 14. Moreover, METex14 was associated with adenocarcinoma (4.8%; 11/230) or sarcomatoid carcinoma (9.5%; 2/21), old age, never-smokers, and early  stage of disease. CONCLUSIONS: METex14 occurs in about 3% of NSCLCs and has characteristic clinicopathologic features. NGS should be the first assay of choice as a multiplex testing. Sanger sequencing can detect METex14, but sensitivity can be hampered by large deletions or low allele frequency. qRT-PCR, an mRNA-based method, is sensitive and specific and can be appropriate for screening METex14 as a single gene testing.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Sep 7., Preselection of Lung Cancer Cases Using FGFR1 mRNA and Gene Copy Number for Treatment With Ponatinib.,"INTRODUCTION: Preclinically, high epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) messenger RNA (FGFR1-MRNA) and FGFR1 amplification (FGFR1-AMP) predicted sensitivity to fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer cell lines. KRAS mutations did not preclude sensitivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Metastatic EGFR- and ALK-negative lung cancers were screened for FGFR1-MRNA by in-situ hybridization (ISH) and FGFR1-AMP by silver in-situ hybridization (SISH). Patients with positive findings were offered ponatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor of FGFR1-4. Differences in overall survival (OS) between cohorts were assessed by the log-rank test. Association of FGFR1 positivity with clinicopathologic features were assessed by Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. RESULTS: A total of 171 cases were prescreened: 9 (7.3%) of 123 SISH+; 53 (42.1%) of 126 ISH+; and 6 cases concordantly positive for SISH and ISH. SISH+ cases had  fewer coincident KRAS mutations (P = .03) than SISH- cases, and ISH+ cases had worse OS (P = .020) than ISH- cases. Data distributions suggested a distinct higher positivity cut point for FGFR1 ISH (≥ 20%), occurring in 29 (23%) of 126 cases, was associated with small-cell lung cancer histology (P = .022), soft tissue metastases (P = .050) and shorter OS (P = .031). Four patients received ponatinib on study: All ISH+ by the initial cut point, 2 of 4 by higher cut point, 1 of 4 SISH+. Tolerability was poor. The best response for the 2 higher ISH cases was stable disease and progressive disease for the 2 lower ISH cases. CONCLUSION: Elevated FGFR1-MRNA is more common than FGFR1-AMP and associated with worse OS.

Ponatinib's poor tolerance suggests further fibroblast growth factor receptor exploration in ISH+ cases should utilize more selective FGFR1 inhibitors.",ALK,1

Epub  2018 Sep 5., Targeted Tissue and Cell-Free Tumor DNA Sequencing of Advanced Lung Squamous-Cell Carcinoma Reveals Clinically Significant Prevalence of Actionable Alterations.,"BACKGROUND: Major guidelines do not recommend routine molecular profiling of lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LUSC) because the prevalence of actionable alterations is thought to be low. Increased utilization of next-generation sequencing (NGS),  particularly with cell-free circulating tumor DNA, facilitates reevaluation of this premise. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of actionable alterations in 2 distinct LUSC cohorts totaling 492 patients. A total of 410 consecutive patients with stage 3B or 4 LUSC were tested with a targeted cell-free circulating DNA NGS assay, and 82 patients with LUSC of any stage were tested with a tissue NGS cancer panel. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, 467 patients (94.9%) had a diagnosis of LUSC, and 25 patients (5.1%) had mixed histology with a squamous component. A total of 10.5% of the LUSC subgroup had somatic alterations with therapeutic relevance, including in EGFR (2.8%), ALK/ROS1 (1.3%), BRAF (1.5%), and MET amplification or  exon 14 skipping (5.1%). Sixteen percent of patients with mixed histology had an  actionable alteration. In the LUSC subgroup, 3 evaluable patients were treated with targeted therapy for an actionable alteration; all of them experienced partial response. CONCLUSION: In this large, real-world LUSC cohort, we observed a clinically significant prevalence of actionable alterations. Accurate local histopathologic  assessment in advanced-stage LUSC can be challenging. Further evaluation of the genomic landscape in this setting is warranted to potentially identify underappreciated treatment options.",ALK,1

Epub  2018 Aug 23., Multiple Biomarker Testing Tissue Consumption and Completion Rates With Single-gene Tests and Investigational Use of Oncomine Dx Target Test for Advanced Non-Small-cell Lung Cancer: A Single-center Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: First-line targeted therapies have been developed for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, small biopsy samples pose a challenge to testing all relevant biomarkers. The present study characterized clinician-ordered single-gene lung cancer testing and evaluated tissue stewardship and the ability to successfully determine mutation status with single-gene testing or investigational use of the Oncomine Dx Target Test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinician-submitted orders for 3659 single-gene tests (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, KRAS, ERBB2, MET, RET, FGFR1) across 1402 samples at a large US-based commercial reference laboratory and 169 investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were retrospectively evaluated. The testing success rates and tissue consumption were evaluated by sample type, test type, and number of single-gene tests per sample. RESULTS: The large majority of lung tissue samples submitted for clinical testing were small (70.5% core needle biopsies; 10.0% fine needle aspirations). With single-gene testing, mutation status was successfully reported for ≥ 1 biomarker  for 88.4% of the clinical samples. The success rates decreased and tissue consumption increased with testing of additional biomarkers. Investigational Oncomine Dx Target Tests were permitted 1 tissue slide each and demonstrated success rates similar to single-gene testing for ≥ 5 biomarkers on core needle biopsies, ≥ 4 biomarkers on fine needle aspirations, and ≥ 2 biomarkers on surgical resection specimens. CONCLUSION: Tissue stewardship is important to enable successful completion of genetic testing and informed NSCLC treatment decisions. Preliminary assessment of the investigational Oncomine Dx Target Test suggests it could facilitate access to multiple biomarker testing using small tissue samples to support therapy decisions for patients with advanced NSCLC.",ALK,1

METHODS: We searched electronic databases from inception to Dec. 2016. Clinical trials and retrospective studies regarding crizotinib and crizotinib versus chemotherapy in treatment of NSCLC were eligible. The primary outcomes were the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). RESULTS: Nine studies (five clinical trials and four retrospective studies) including 729 patients met the inclusion criteria. Crizotinib treatment revealed  1-year OS of 77.1% and PFS of 9.17 months. And crizotinib had a better performance than chemotherapy in ORR (OR: 4.97, 95%CI: 3.16 to 7.83, P<0.00001, I2=35%). DCR revealed superiority with crizotinib than chemotherapy (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.33 to 5.01, P<0.00001, I2=0%). PR (partial response) were significant superior to that of chemotherapy through direct systematic review. No statistically significant difference in CR (complete response) was found between  crizotinib-treated group and chemotherapy-treated group. Regarding SD (stable disease), chemotherapy-treated group had a better performance than crizotinib-treated group. Common adverse events associated with crizotinib were visual disorder, gastrointestinal side effects, and elevated liver aminotransferase levels, whereas common adverse events with chemotherapy were fatigue, nausea, and hematologic toxicity. CONCLUSION: This systematic review revealed improved objective response rate and  increased disease control rate in crizotinib group comparing with chemotherapy group. Crizotinib treatment would be a favorable treatment option for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. ALK inhibitors may have future potential applications in other cancers driven by ALK or c-MET gene mutations.",ALK,1

However, the prevalence of these mutations in various populations in India has not been studied. Furthermore, the correlation of histologic pattern with the mutation is  not clear. Materials and Methods: A total of 64 biopsy-proven lung adenocarcinomas were selected. In 51 of these, EGFR mutational analysis was performed using Qiagen EGFR pyrosequencing kit and in 56 cases of these ALK1 immunohistochemistry (IHC)  was done using ALK (D5F3) antibody and the Ventana Benchmark® XT automated IHC slide staining system for the detection of overexpression. The adenocarcinomas were classified into well, moderate, and poorly differentiated, and the histological pattern was recorded according to the WHO 2014 classification. Results: EGFR mutation was positive in 23 cases (45.10%) and positive ALK1 expression by IHC in 12 cases (21.43%). Both mutations were positive in two cases. Both mutations were seen in well-differentiated and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the expression was highest in tumors with a predominant acinar pattern. Conclusions: The incidence of both EGFR and ALK1 mutations is higher in the population studied and seem to correlate with a well differentiated, acinar pattern on morphology.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Oct 30., Identification of a highly lethal V3+ TP53+ subset in ALK+ lung adenocarcinoma.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have improved prognosis in metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-driven lung adenocarcinoma, but patient outcomes vary widely. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical course of all cases with assessable baseline TP53 status and/or ALK fusion variant treated at our institutions (n = 102). TP53 mutations were present in 17/87 (20%) and the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK variant 3 (V3) in 41/92 (45%) patients. The number of metastatic sites at diagnosis was affected more by the presence of V3 than by TP53 mutations, and highest with both factors  (mean 5.3, p < 0.001). Under treatment with ALK TKI, progression-free survival (PFS) was shorter with either TP53 mutations or V3, while double positive cases appeared to have an even higher risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.9, p = 0.015). The negative effect of V3 on PFS of TKI-treated patients was strong already in the first line (HR = 2.5, p = 0.037) and decreased subsequently, whereas a trend for  PFS impairment under first-line TKI by TP53 mutations became stronger and statistically significant only when considering all treatment lines together. Overall survival was impaired more by TP53 mutations (HR = 4.9, p = 0.003) than by V3 (HR = 2.4, p = 0.018), while patients with TP53 mutated V3-driven tumors carried the highest risk of death (HR = 9.1, p = 0.02). Thus, TP53 mutations and  V3 are independently associated with enhanced metastatic spread, shorter TKI responses and inferior overall survival in ALK+ lung adenocarcinoma. Both markers could assist selection of cases for more aggressive management and guide development of novel therapeutic strategies. In combination, they define a patient subset with very poor outcome.",ALK,1

Increasing understanding of the molecular changes that drive tumor progression has transformed the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless, various countries differ in the degree of implementation of genetic tests and the availability of innovative drugs. The LungCARD consortium created a questionnaire to collect information about the local research and clinical practices related to lung cancer diagnosis and therapy. METHODS: A survey composed of 37 questions related to specific lung cancer pharmacogenomics and therapy, was distributed among 18 countries. RESULTS: All together 36 responses were gathered, answered mainly by clinicians.  The majority attends 50-200 cancer cases per month, 20-50% of all cancer cases are lung cancer patients, and more than 80% are with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapy is applied to 50% on average of all NSCLC patients. Forty five percent of participating medical oncologists are treating their patients with immunotherapy. More than 90% of the respondents are guided by results of genetic tests in introducing targeted treatment. As expected, the majority orders EGFR gene testing (85%), followed by ALK (58%) and KRAS testing (32%). Almost all (96%) agreed that more biomarkers should be included in routine genetic testing (ROS1, anti-PDL1, KRAS, MET, HER2, BRAF...), and that blood test  is useful in pharmacogenomic testing. CONCLUSION: There is a great variation between countries with respect to all discussed topics. However, the majority recognized a necessity of introducing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics and potential of testing from  blood. The biggest problem in the treatment of NSCLC is still an access to innovative drugs.",ALK,1

This study elucidated the prevalence and prognostic significance of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) and rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) in patients with surgically resected primary LAC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 675 consecutive patients who underwent radical resection at a single institution. We concurrently analyzed mutations in EGFR and the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog gene (KRAS)  by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and investigated ALK rearrangements by immunohistochemistry. LAC with or without various oncogenic mutations was studied for clinicopathological features and their association with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULT: ALK rearrangements and EGFR mutations were detected in 75 and 312 patients, respectively, with coexistence in 5 cases. ALK rearrangements and mutations in EGFR and KRAS were mutually exclusive. Compared with patients with EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements were more common in younger patients, and those with advanced tumors, lymph node metastases, and higher rates of postoperative adjuvant therapy. Histologically, EGFR mutations were more common than ALK rearrangements in patients with the acinar predominant subtype and the lepidic predominant subtype of LAC, whereas ALK rearrangements were more frequent in the solid predominant subtype with mucin production and invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas. ALK-positive patients had a significantly worse DFS than those with EGFR mutations and wild-type (WT) patients. The mean OS after surgical procedures was significantly longer in EGFR-mutated versus WT patients. No significant differences were found in patients with ALK-positive tumors compared  with EGFR-mutated and WT patients. CONCLUSION: Clinicopathological features of LAC with ALK rearrangements differ from those of LAC with EGFR mutations. Patients with ALK rearrangements had a significantly worse DFS than those harboring EGFR mutations. Thus, ALK rearrangements are an adverse prognostic factor in surgically-resected LAC patients, while EGFR mutations are associated with a better prognosis.",ALK,1

In this work, the mechanisms of brigatinib binding to wild type and four mutant ALKs were investigated to gain insight into the dynamic energetic and structural information with respect to the design of novel inhibitors. Comparison between ALK-brigatinib and ALK-crizotinib suggests that the scaffold of brigatinib is well anchored to the residue Met1199 of hinge region by two hydrogen bonds, and the residue Lys1150 has the strong electrostatic interaction  with the dimethylphosphine oxide moiety in brigatinib. These ALK mutations have significant influences on the flexibility of P-loop region and DFG sequences, but do not impair the hydrogen bonds between brigatinib and the residue Met1199 of hinge region. And mutations (L1196M, G1269A, F1174L, and R1275Q) induce diverse conformational changes of brigatinib and the obvious energy variation of residues Glu1167, Arg1209, Asp1270, and Asp1203. Together, the detailed explanation of mechanisms of those mutations with brigatinib further provide several guidelines  for the development of more effective ALK inhibitors.",ALK,1

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement are commonly found in patients of adenocarcinoma lung against, which targeted therapy is available. In this era of  personalized medicine, it is a rationale to detect these molecular alterations in cases of lung carcinomas. Aims: The objectives were to compare the diagnostic efficacy of cytological samples for the detection of EGFR and ALK protein expression using immunocytochemistry in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. Materials and Methods: We compared 22 cell blocks and biopsies for the detection  of EGFR and ALK protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). EGFR IHC was performed using EGFR Receptor (E746-A750 del Specific) (6B6) monoclonal antibody  and ALK IHC was done using Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) monoclonal primary antibody. Results: Two cases were found to be positive; 20 cases were negative for EGFR IHC both in biopsies and cell blocks. ALK IHC was positive in one case; negative in 21 cases. The results of IHC were also concordant for biopsies and cell blocks. The sensitivity and specificity were 100% for immunocytochemical detection of ALK and EGFR in cell blocks with respect to biopsies. Conclusion: We conclude that cell blocks can serve as a potential substitute for  biopsies for detection of EGFR and ALK protein by immunocytochemistry, whenever patient presents with effusion and biopsy cannot be done or when tissue is not adequate.",ALK,1

Nicotine dependence remains the major cause of failure of smoking cessation. We investigated the risk factors for nicotine dependence in patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Eligible patients were identified from November 2014 to February 2015. Age, marital status, educational level, annual household income, occupation, histology of lung cancer, tumor stage, smoking status, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) level, drive gene mutations, sleep quality, and patient personality were assessed. Physical nicotine dependence was assessed by the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). RESULTS: In total, 202 smokers were included in this study. Univariate analysis showed that marital status and pain were significantly correlated with nicotine dependence. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that age at the initiation of smoking, attempts to quit, NSE level, and sleep quality were significantly correlated with FTND scores. CONCLUSIONS: Pain, more attempts to quit, and poorer sleep quality were significantly associated with nicotine dependence. These risk factors could help  to prevent smoking in Chinese patients with lung cancer.",ALK,1

New promising therapies have emerged based on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunity checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including anti-PD-1, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab. The  prescription of pembrolizumab has been approved by FDA and EMA for advanced stages non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), restricted for first-line setting to patients whose tumor presents ≥50% of PD-L1 positive tumor cells (TC), and ≥1% for second-line and beyond, leading to consider PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic tool for pembrolizumab. Very recently, the EMA has approved durvalumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC not progressing after chemoradiotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 on ≥1% of TC. Four standardized PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays have been used in clinical trials; 22C3 and 28-8 PharmDx assays on Dako/Agilent platforms, and SP142 and SP263 assays on Ventana platforms, each test having been developed initially for a specific ICI. They differ in terms of primary monoclonal antibody, platform, detection system and scoring methods with different thresholds of positivity validated in clinical trials. Several studies have shown a close analytical performance of the 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 assays regarding TC staining in NSCLC, with poor concordance with SP142 assay and for immune cells. However, as dedicated platforms are not available in all pathology laboratories and because of the high cost of these assays, laboratory developed tests are widely used in many countries. Their validation must guarantee the same sensitivities and specificities as compared to standardized assays. Overall, PD-L1 test is of great help to select patients who could benefit for ICI and most pathologists have included this test in their daily practice for advanced stages NSCLC, besides ALK and ROS1 IHC.",ALK,1

Although genotype-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent the standard of care for subsets of oncogene-driven NSCLC, patients may receive ICIs during their disease course. The impact of sequential ICI and tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy on the risk of hepatotoxicity has not been described. METHODS: Patients with advanced ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK)-driven, ROS1-driven, or MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET)-driven NSCLC treated with crizotinib, with or without preceding ICI therapy, were identified.  The cumulative incidences of crizotinib-associated grade 3 or higher increases in transaminase level (per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) were compared. RESULTS: We identified 453 patients who had NSCLC with an oncogenic alteration in ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK), ROS1, or MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase gene (MET) and were treated with crizotinib (11 with and 442 without prior ICI therapy). Among the 11 patients treated with an ICI followed by crizotinib, five (cumulative incidence 45.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 14.9-72.2]) experienced development of a grade 3 or 4 increase in alanine transaminase level and four (cumulative incidence 36.4% [95% CI: 10.0-64.2]) experienced development of a grade 3 or 4 increase in aspartate transaminase level. In comparison, among the 442 patients who received crizotinib only, a grade 3 or 4 increase in alanine transaminase level occurred in 34 patients (cumulative incidence 8.1% [95% CI: 5.7-11.0, p < 0.0001]) and a grade 3 or 4 increase in aspartate transaminase level occurred in 14 (cumulative incidence 3.4% [95% CI: 1.9-5.5, p < 0.0001]). There were no grade 5 transaminitis events.  All cases of hepatotoxicity after sequential ICI and crizotinib use were reversible and nonfatal, and no case met the Hy's law criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential ICI and crizotinib treatment is associated with a significantly increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Careful consideration and monitoring for hepatotoxicity may be warranted in patients treated with crizotinib after ICI therapy.",ALK,1

At the primary analysis (median follow-up time 10.6 months), pembrolizumab significantly improved objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS); the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) was 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42‒1.91). Herein, we present an updated analysis. METHODS: A total of 123 patients with previously untreated stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous NSCLC without EGFR and/or ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) aberrations were randomized 1:1 to four cycles of PC with or without pembrolizumab, 200 mg every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab treatment continued for 2 years; maintenance pemetrexed was permitted in both groups. Eligible patients in  the PC-alone group with radiologic progression could cross over to pembrolizumab monotherapy. p Values are nominal (one-sided p < 0.025). RESULTS: As of December 1, 2017, the median follow-up time was 23.9 months. The ORR was 56.7% with pembrolizumab plus PC versus 30.2% with PC alone (estimated difference 26.4% [95% CI: 8.9%‒42.4%, p = 0.0016]). PFS was significantly improved with pembrolizumab plus PC versus PC alone (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33‒0.86, p = 0.0049). A total of 41 patients in the PC-alone group received subsequent anti‒programmed death 1/anti‒programmed death ligand 1 therapy. The HR for OS was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.32‒0.95, p = 0.0151). Forty-one percent of patients in the pembrolizumab plus PC group and 27% in the PC-alone group had grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events.

Epub 2019 Mar 28.,Harnessing Clinical Sequencing Data for Survival Stratification of Patients with  Metastatic Lung Adenocarcinomas.,"Purpose: Broad panel sequencing of tumors facilitates routine care of people with cancer as well as clinical trial matching for novel genome-directed therapies. We sought to extend the use of broad panel sequencing results to survival stratification and clinical outcome prediction. Patients and Methods: Using sequencing results from a cohort of 1,054 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas, we developed OncoCast, a machine learning tool for survival risk stratification and biomarker identification. Results: With OncoCast, we stratified this patient cohort into four risk groups based on tumor genomic profile. Patients whose tumors harbored a high-risk profile had a median survival of 7.3 months (95% CI 5.5-10.9), compared to a low  risk group with a median survival of 32.8 months (95% CI 26.3-38.5), with a hazard ratio of 4.6 (P<2e-16), far superior to any individual gene predictor or standard clinical characteristics. We found that co-mutations of both STK11 and KEAP1 are a strong determinant of unfavorable prognosis with currently available  therapies. In patients with targetable oncogenes including EGFR/ALK/ROS1 and received targeted therapies, the tumor genetic background further differentiated  survival with mutations in TP53 and ARID1A contributing to a higher risk score for shorter survival. Conclusion: Mutational profile derived from broad-panel sequencing presents an effective genomic stratification for patient survival in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. OncoCast is available as a public resource that facilitates the incorporation of mutational data to predict individual patient prognosis and compare risk characteristics of patient populations.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 ep 3.,Current status of immune checkpoint inhibitors in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.,"Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, including in Korea. Systemic therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy should be provided to patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Applications of targeted therapy, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase  (ALK) inhibitors, in patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement has enabled dramatic improvements in efficacy and tolerability. Despite advances in research and a better understanding of the molecular pathways of NSCLC, few effective therapeutic options are available for most patients with  NSCLC without druggable targets, especially for patients with squamous cell NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 or anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have demonstrated durable response rates across a broad range of solid tumors, including NSCLC, which has revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors. Here, we review the current status and future approaches of immune checkpoint inhibitors that are being investigated for NSCLC with a focus on pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab.",ALK,1

However, our current knowledge regarding the resistance mechanisms is based on non-synonymous mutation and amplification in ALK, with the reasons still unknown for nearly half of all such cases. Other than genomic alteration as a resistance mechanism, up to 10% of NSCLC with activating epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation showed resistance to EGFR TKI through histologic transformation. Although limited in number, there are cases showing transformed samples retaining the initial genomic alteration, which support lineage transition as a novel resistance mechanism. In this report, we described the first case of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) transformation from adenocarcinoma (ADC) in NSCLC with ALK rearrangement after treatment with ALK TKI.",ALK,1

It has remained unclear, however, whether cytotoxic chemotherapy affects the immune microenvironment in NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated changes in programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density in NSCLC patients who underwent rebiopsy at the site of recurrence after postoperative platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, or in those who underwent rebiopsy after one or more chemotherapeutic regimens at the advanced stage. The PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) and CD8+ TIL density were determined by immunohistochemistry. TMB was estimated by next-generation sequencing with a cancer gene panel (409 genes). RESULTS: Seventeen patients with NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK were enrolled.  Although PD-L1 TPS tended to be increased in rebiopsy samples compared with initial biopsy tissue, this difference was not significant (P =  0.113). Seven patients showed an increase in PD-L1 TPS, with this change being pronounced in four. Two cases in which PD-L1 TPS increased from 0 to 90% or from 0 to 95% after cytotoxic chemotherapy also showed a durable response to subsequent treatment with an ICI. No substantial correlation between PD-L1 TPS and TMB was apparent either before (R = 0.112) or after (R = 0.101) chemotherapy. A moderate correlation was detected between PD-L1 TPS and CD8+ TIL density before chemotherapy (R = 0.517) and a negligible correlation after (R = 0.0219). CONCLUSION: Cytotoxic chemotherapy may change the biological characteristics of tumors including PD-L1 expression level and TMB.",ALK,1

Epub 2018 Nov 23.,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care chemotherapy for first-line treatment of PD-L1 positive (>50%) metastatic squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in France.,"INTRODUCTION: In the KEYNOTE-024 trial, pembrolizumab demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus  Standard-of-Care (SoC) platinum-based doublets for first-line treatment of PD-L1  -positive (≥50%) metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with no EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus SoC platinum-based chemotherapy from the French healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A three-state partitioned-survival model was adapted to project outcomes and costs of squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients respectively, over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical and utility data were collected from the trial. A  network meta-analysis was performed to consider platinum-based triplets also used for non-squamous NSCLC. Direct medical costs were considered based on ressources  identified from the trial and literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per Life Year (LY) and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: For squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.93 LY (11 months), and 0.74 QALY (9 months) for an incremental cost of €62,032 compared with platinum-based doublets. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based doublets was €66,825/LY and €84,097/QALY. For non-squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.85-1.32 LYs (10.2-15.8 months) and 0.64-1.02 QALYs (7.7-12.2 months) for an incremental cost varying from €-14,947-+47,064 depending on the specific comparator. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was €62,846/LY and €78,729/QALY; regimens including pemetrexed were dominated. Results were most sensitive to extrapolations of survival outcomes and assumptions for continued effectiveness and treatment duration of pembrolizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab appears cost-effective versus SoC chemotherapy for first-line treatment of PD-L1-positive (50%) metastatic NSCLC patients in France, assuming willingness-to-pay under 100,000€/QALY (OECD threshold in the discussion section).",ALK,1

However, resistance mechanisms following multiple TKI treatments in ALK-positive NSCLC are not fully elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mutation profiles of 422 cancer-relevant genes in 52 patients with post-TKI biopsy samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS), and compared between patients receiving crizotinib alone (n = 35) and multi-TKIs (n = 17). RESULTS: EML4-ALK variant 3 is the most frequent ALK variants in this cohort, followed by EML4-ALK variant 1. Half of the patients harbored ALK activating mutations upon progression on crizotinib treatment. After multi-TKIs treatment, 59% of the cases developed resistant ALK mutations, and concomitant ALK activating mutations were more commonly observed in this cohort (P = 0.031). Specifically, ALK G1269 A, L1196 M, and C1156Y substitutions were more common in  crizotinib-alone samples, while ALK G1202R was significantly more enriched post-multi-TKIs (P = 0.009). Activated bypass signaling tended to be more prevalent in patients post-multi-TKIs. Furthermore, dual activation of ALK and bypass signaling was more frequently found in the multi-TKIs group (5/17, 29%) in contrast to crizotinib-alone (2/35, 6%) (P = 0.031). Additionally, concurrent TP53 mutation demonstrated significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS)  compared with TP53 wildtype in crizotinib-alone group (median PFS: 8 vs 13 months, Hazard Ratio = 1.494, P = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Concurrent ALK activating mutations and/or upregulated bypass signaling are more enriched in patients undergoing multiple ALK TKI treatments compared to crizotinib alone. Concomitant TP53 mutation correlated to unfavorable survival when receiving a single TKI crizotinib.",ALK,1

In this era of cancer immunotherapy, humanized mouse models which recapitulate human immune system, are needed for predicting immunotherapy response in patients. We established a Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which can be used as a preclinical testing platform for assessing efficacy of different immunotherapeutic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model was established by engrafting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into NOD/scid/IL-2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice. Cytokine array was performed to assess serological similarity between patient and the Hu-PBL-NSG mouse, and microscopic immune cell infiltration was observed in various organs mouse model. Human anti-PD-1 therapy was treated for assessing drug efficacy in patient-derived tumor. RESULTS: hCD3+hCD45+ T-cells and antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and MDSC) increased in the serum of Hu-PBL-NSG mouse 24 h after the  transfusion of human PBMCs, and CD3 + T cells were observed in lung, liver, kidney, spleen sections. Cytokine arrays of human and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse revealed high similarity of Th1, Th2, Th17-related cytokines. A tumor xenograft was engrafted from an EML4-ALK patient, and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse was sacrificed for histological analyses. hCD3+ T cells were infiltrated within the tumor, and CD11c + cells, which represent antigen-presenting capability, were seen in spleen, lung, liver and kidney. When anti-PD-1 Ab was treated intraperitoneally,  xenograft tumor showed significant reduction in volume after day 6, and increased expression of immune response-related genes on microarray analysis in the tumor.  Mostly IFN-gamma and its related gene sets were significantly changed (FDR < 0.25, GSEA). CONCLUSION: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which highly resembles human immune system was successfully established. This model could be a strong preclinical model for testing efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents, and also for pursuing novel immunotherapy treatment strategies in advanced NSCLC.",ALK,1

EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 are 3 major driver genes that play an important role in lung cancer development and precision management. Additionally, rare genetic alterations continue to be discovered and may become novel targets for therapy. The RET gene is one of such  rare genetic alteration of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this report, we present a RET-positive case that benefited from cabozantinib treatment. PATIENT CONCERN: A 50-year-old male patient was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma 2 years ago, at that time he received palliative surgery of pulmonary carcinoma and completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Six months later, he was hospitalized in our cancer center due to the  disease recurrence, presenting with pleural metastasis. DIAGNOSIS: Gene alteration was examined using the intraoperative specimen by PCR  method, and KIF5B/RET gene fusion was detected. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with late-stage lung adenocarcinoma with RET gene mutation. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received treatment with cabozantinib from June 2017. OUTCOMES: Cabozantinib was administered (140 mg orally, once daily) for approximate 9 months, and his disease achieved stable disease (SD). During that period, there were no severe adverse events (AE), except for a grade II rash (CTCAE 4.0). LESSONS: We found that the RET fusion gene is a novel driver molecular of lung adenocarcinoma in patients without common mutations in such genes as EGFR, ALK, and ROS1. This case report supports a rationale for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients with a RET fusion and provides alternative treatment options for these types of NSCLC patients.",ALK,1

AIM: Activation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene has been found in several human cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, novel drugs targeting ALK gene have been extensively investigated in NSCLC. However, concerns about ALK inhibitors-induced liver toxicities have been increasing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible prospective clinical studies have been searched in several databases. Primary outcomes of interest were incidence rates of liver  toxicities, relative risks (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Data from 2418 patients (1873 in the experimental arm; 545 in the control arm) were included. The incidences of all-grade alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation were 26.0% (95% CI: 17.4%-37%), and 23.2% (95% CI, 16.7%-31.4%), respectively. The incidences of high-grade ALT and AST elevation were 8.4% (95% CI, 5.1%-13.4% and 7.0% (95% CI:  5.4%-9.0%), respectively. Sub-group analysis according to the ALK inhibitors found that pooled incidence of liver toxicities associated with ceritinib was higher than that of crizotinib and alectinib. In comparison with chemotherapy, ALK inhibitors significantly increased the all-grade and high-grade ALT elevation (RR 2.37, 95% CI, 1.97-2.86; P < .001; RR 7.34, 95% CI, 3.95-13.63; P < .001) and AST elevation (RR 3.27, 95% CI, 2.47-4.34; P < .001; RR 11.54, 95% CI, 4.33-30.7; P < .001), respectively. No publication bias was detected for RR of ALT and AST. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study offer substantial evidence that ALK inhibitors treatment in advanced NSCLC significantly increases the risk of developing all-grade and high-grade liver toxicities in comparison with controls. Clinicians should recognize liver toxicities promptly as early interventions may  alleviate future complications.",ALK,1

Epub  2018 Aug 31.,Alectinib Resistance in ALK-Rearranged Lung Cancer by Dual Salvage Signaling in a Clinically Paired Resistance Model.,"The mechanisms responsible for the development of resistance to alectinib, a second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, are still unclear,  and few cell lines are currently available for investigating ALK-rearranged lung  cancer. To identify the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to alectinib, two patient-derived cell lines were established from an alectinib-naïve ALK-rearranged lung cancer and then after development of alectinib resistance. The properties acquired during treatments were detected by comparisons of the two cell lines, and then functional analyses were performed. Coactivation of c-Src and MET was identified after the development of alectinib resistance. Combinatorial therapy against Src and MET significantly restored alectinib sensitivity in vitro (17.2-fold). Increased apoptosis, reduction of tumor volume, and inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling molecules for proliferation and survival were observed when the three kinases (Src, MET, and ALK) were inhibited. A patient-derived xenograft from the alectinib-resistant cells indicated that combination therapy with a saracatinib and crizotinib significantly decreased tumor size in vivo. To confirm the generality, a conventional alectinib-resistant cell line model (H2228-AR1S) was established from NCI-H2228 cells (EML4-ALK variant 3a/b). In H2228-AR1S, combination inhibition of Src and MET also restored alectinib sensitivity. These data reveal that dual salvage signaling from MET and Src is a potential therapeutic target in alectinib-resistant patients. IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility to elucidate personalized drug-resistance mechanisms from individual patient samples.",ALK,1

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 53) with ALK-positive advanced  non-small cell lung cancer treated with an ALK TKI were identified through internal databases of three cancer centers and divided into groups A (< 65 years  old; n = 34) and B (≥65 years old; n = 19). Progression-free survival (PFS), ALK  TKI safety and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Uni- and multivariate PFS and OS analyses were performed. RESULTS: Crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib were administered in 94 and 100%, 35 and 31%, 38 and 52% of patients in groups A and B, respectively. The median PFS (months) was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.4-12.4) and 5.6 (95% CI, 2.5-14.7) with crizotinib (log-rank 0.0009, p = 0.9), 4.7 (95% CI, 1.0-11.5) and 23.0 (95% CI, 0.8-27.7) with ceritinib (log-rank 0.44, p = 0.5), and 21.2 (95% CI, 1.2 to not reached, NR) and 5.6 (95% CI, 0.5 to NR) with alectinib (log-rank 0.53, p = 0.5)  in groups A and B, respectively. The median OS (months) comprised 29.8 (95% CI, 21.0 to NR) and 25.1 (95% CI, 10.8-53.6) in groups A and B, respectively (log-rank 0.57, p = 0.4). Age affected neither PFS nor OS. 19 and 37%, 50 and 40%, and 0 and 0% of patients in groups A and B, treated with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib, respectively, developed high-grade adverse events. The  treatment discontinuation rate was 9 and 21%, 16 and 60%, 0 and 0% with crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib in groups A and B, respectively.

We evaluated the frequency and clinical characteristics of ALK rearrangements (ALKr) in Latin America. METHODS: A total of 5,130 lung cancer patients from 10 Latin American countries were screened for inclusion. ALKr detection was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to assess method variability. Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 5,130 patients screened, 8.4% (n = 433) had nonevaluable FISH  tests. Evaluable FISH analyses revealed positive ALKr in 6.8% (320/4,697) of the  study population, which included patients from 9 countries. ALKr distribution for each country was: Mexico 7.6% (79/1,034), Colombia 4.1% (10/242), Argentina 6.0%  (153/2,534), Costa Rica 9.5% (13/137), Panama 4.4% (5/114), Uruguay 5.4% (2/37),  Chile 8.6% (16/185), Venezuela 8.9% (13/146), and Peru 10.8% (29/268). RT-PCR showed high positive (83.6%) and negative (99.7%) predictive values when compared to the gold standard FISH. In contrast, IHC only showed a high negative predictive value (94.6%).

The identification of subclonal mutations using deep sequencing to evaluate the degree of molecular heterogeneity may improve IIIA-N2 classification. The aim of this prospective study was to assess mutational and immunohistochemical characteristics in primary tumours and  involved lymph nodes (LN) in operated patients. Four patients operated for primary lung carcinoma and unisite N2 mediastinal involvement were consecutively  selected. Samples (tumour and paired LN) were analysed for PD1, PD-L1 and CD8 immunostaining. Somatic mutation testing was performed by deep targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), with the AmpliSeq™ Colon and Lung Cancer Panel (LifeTechnology). A total of 9 primary lung cancer samples and 10 LN stations were analysed. For each cancer, we found 2 mutations, with allelic ratios from 3% to 72%. Mutational patterns were heterogeneous for 2 primary tumours. In 3 cases, mutations observed in the primary tumour were not found in LN metastases (ALK, FGFR3, MET). Inversely, in 1 case, a KRAS mutation was found in LN but not in the primary tumour. All primary tumours were found PD-L1 positive while CD8+ T cells  infiltrate varied. In the different examined LN samples, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ and PD1+ T cells infiltrate were not similar to the primary tumour. This preliminary prospective study shows the diversity of intra-tumour and LN mutations using routinely-used targeted NGS, concerning both mutated gene and allelic ratio.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) gene rearrangements are found in approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas and are associated with specific clinical features including a high risk of brain metastases. Crizotinib was the first ALK inhibitor developed and it demonstrated  improved outcomes in patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in comparison with chemotherapy. However, despite an initial response, all ALK-positive NSCLC patients develop acquired resistance to crizotinib. Because the most frequent mechanism of resistance is the development of a secondary ALK mutation, second (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib) and third-generation (lorlatinib) ALK inhibitors were developed. Alectinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor and was shown to be effective for a broad spectrum of ALK rearrangements and ALK mutations. It was also shown to have high intracranial efficacy.

We evaluated genetic aberrations, clinicopathologic characteristics, and PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) using a PD-L1 22C3 assay kit. RESULTS: In 407 consecutive NSCLC patients, simultaneous genotyping identified 14 (3.4%) ROS1 and 19 (4.7%) ALK rearrangements, as well as 106 (26%) EGFR mutations. These mutations were mutually exclusive and were found in patients with similar clinical features, including younger age, a prevalence in women, adenocarcinoma, and advanced stage. The PD-L1 assay was performed on 130 consecutive NSCLC samples. High PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 50%) was observed in 29 (22.3%) tumors. PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥ 1%) was significantly associated with wild type EGFR, while ROS1 rearrangement was associated with high PD-L1 expression. Of the 14 cases with ROS1 rearrangement, 12 (85.7%) showed PD-L1 expression and 5 (35.7%) showed high PD-L1 expression.

Epub 2018 Oct 2.,MYC Amplification as a Potential Mechanism of Primary Resistance to Crizotinib in ALK-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Brief Report.,"INTRODUCTION: Translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) can be effectively targeted in advanced non-small cell lung cancer by ALK-TKI inhibitors including Crizotinib. However, the development of acquired resistance often limits the duration of these therapies. While several mechanisms of secondary resistance have been already identified, little is known about molecular determinants of primary resistance. In our brief report we investigated the tumor molecular profile of a patient who failed to respond to Crizotinib. METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were run on tumor specimen as well as search and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood. Confirmation of clinical findings was achieved using a translational cell-line in vitro model. RESULTS: We identified the amplification of MYC as a potential new mechanism of primary resistance to ALK inhibition. Human EML4-ALK rearranged cells infected with a lentiviral vector carrying full-length human MYC cDNA were treated in vitro with crizotinib and alectinib. Overexpression of MYC overexpression was associated with a reduced sensitivity to both ALK-inhibitors. MYC-overexpressing  clones displayed also increased levels of both cyclin D and E and their growth was reduced by using Cdk4/6 inhibitors such as Palbociclib. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that the MYC gene may be implicated in the mechanism of primary resistance to ALK inhibitors. We also suggest potential MYC-directed inhibition strategies to overcome primary resistance in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",ALK,1

A 54-year-old woman with lung adenocarcinoma harboring ALK rearrangement previously treated with first-line alectinib and second-line cisplatin/pemetrexed showed poor performance status (PS) with rapid progression.  She was treated with ceritinib as salvage treatment, upon which tumor shrinkage was demonstrated on CT and her PS gradually improved. The best supportive care is recommended for patients with advanced NSCLC with poor PS due to lower treatment  efficacy and more toxicities than those with good PS. In this case, rapid progression led to a poor PS; however, ceritinib achieved a breakthrough in this  case. The optimal treatment sequence and key drugs in ALK-positive NSCLC remain controversial.

Epub 2018 Aug 18.,Switchable CAR-T cells mediate remission in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a disease of unmet medical  need. While immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells has shown much promise in haematological malignancies, their efficacy for solid tumours is challenged by the lack of tumour-specific antigens required to avoid on-target, off-tumour effects. Switchable CAR-T cells whereby activity of the CAR-T cell is controlled by dosage of a tumour antigen-specific recombinant Fab-based 'switch' to afford a fully tunable response may overcome this translational barrier. DESIGN: In this present study, we have used conventional and switchable CAR-T cells to target the antigen HER2, which is upregulated on tumour cells, but also  present at low levels on normal human tissue. We used patient-derived xenograft models derived from patients with stage IV PDAC that mimic the most aggressive features of PDAC, including severe liver and lung metastases. RESULTS: Switchable CAR-T cells followed by administration of the switch directed against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-induced complete remission in difficult-to-treat, patient-derived advanced pancreatic tumour models. Switchable HER2 CAR-T cells were as effective as conventional HER2 CAR-T  cells in vivo testing a range of different CAR-T cell doses. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a switchable CAR-T system is efficacious against aggressive and disseminated tumours derived from patients with advanced PDAC while affording the potential safety of a control switch.",CAR-T,2

By developing a fully human CAR (huCAR), these human anti-mouse immune responses are likely eliminated. This, perhaps, not only increases the persistence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells-thereby reducing the risk of tumor relapse-but also facilitates administration of multiple, temporally separated doses of CAR T cells to the same recipient. To these ends, we have designed and constructed a second-generation fully human anti-CD19 CAR (or huCAR19) containing a fully human single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) fused with a CD8a hinge, a 4-1BB transmembrane domain and intracellular T cell signaling domains of 4-1BB and CD3z. T cells expressing this CAR specifically recognized and lysed CD19+ target cells produced cytokines and proliferated in vitro. Moreover, cell volume  data revealed that our huCAR construct cannot induce antigen-independent tonic signaling in the absence of cognate antigen. Considering our results, our anti-CD19 huCAR may overcome issues of transgene immunogenicity that plague trials utilizing CARs containing mouse-derived ScFvs. These results suggest that  this huCAR19 be safely and effectively applied for adaptive T cell immunotherapy  in clinical practice.",CAR-T,2

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies have been approved for use in  relapsed or refractory leukemia and lymphoma based on promising efficacy in clinical trials. However, data are lacking on patient-reported toxicity and impact on HRQoL. This review provides an overview of the incorporation of PROs in CAR-T cell therapy and the specific challenges in this context. The first step is to demonstrate feasibility of PRO monitoring in the acute phase after CAR-T cell  infusion. Apart from core PRO domains like physical functioning, disease-related  symptoms, and symptomatic adverse effects, important measures to consider are cognitive functioning and financial toxicity. Because there are no validated PRO  instruments in the setting of CAR-T cell therapy, universally validated measures  like Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) could be considered, which is also recommended in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Given the timeline of toxicities with CAR-T cell therapy, PRO instruments should be administered at baseline and at least weekly in the first 30 days. Subsequently, frequent monitoring of PROs in the first year might be helpful in identifying short- and intermediate-term toxicities, functional limitations, and neuropsychiatric effects. The major potential challenge in acute phase would be missing data when patients develop severe cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity. Designing a strategy for handling missing data is crucial. The long-term safety of CAR-T cell therapy is not well characterized because of short follow-up in most studies reported thus far. PROs should be measured at least yearly after the first year to identify potential late effects  like cognitive deficit or autoimmune manifestations. Collaboration between institutions performing cellular therapy and engagement with patients, clinicians, and statisticians with expertise in PROs are crucial for setting a comprehensive agenda on integration of PROs with CAR-T cell therapy.",CAR-T,2

Biomarkers are not only potentially able to inform physicians and researchers of immunotherapy targets in particular but could also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments and  to predict incidence of side effects in some circumstances. Identification of new biomarkers can therefore not only contribute to the development of new therapeutic and prognostic strategies for CAR T-cell therapy for cancer but also  help to generate improved clinical practices for early recognition and minimization of adverse effects while preserving the antitumor activity of the CAR T cells.

We analyzed the critical elements of 289 clinical trials posted on the clinicaltrials.gov website by sponsors from the two countries and evaluated the efficacy data in available 50 published CAR T-cell studies. Our analysis shows that China has become the country with the largest number of CAR-T cell clinical trials by the end of 2017, while overall subject sample size and study center numbers are still larger, and  the design of the clinical trials is more cautious in the United States. There are obvious differences between the two countries in CAR-targeted antigens in solid tumors and genetic modifications besides CARs for enhancing the potency of  CAR T-cells. Although the currently available response rates are promising in both countries, it is inexpedient to conclude that the clinical efficacy is comparable between the two countries considering the smaller patient sample sizes and discrete distribution of median cell doses in China.

Two CAR T products were recently approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment ofpatients up to age 25years with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and/or adults with large B cell lymphoma. Many more CAR T products, as well as other immunotherapies, including various immune cell- and bi-specific antibody-based approaches that function by activation of immune effector cells, are in clinical development for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. These therapies are associated with unique toxicities of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. The assessment and grading of these toxicities vary considerably across clinical trials and across institutions, making it difficult to compare the safety of different products and hindering the ability to develop optimal strategies for management of these toxicities. Moreover, some aspects of these grading systems can be challenging to implement across centers. Therefore, in an effort to harmonize the definitions and grading  systems for CRS and neurotoxicity, experts from all aspects of the field met on June 20 and 21, 2018, at a meeting supported by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT; formerly American Society for Blood  and Marrow Transplantation, ASBMT) in Arlington, VA. Here we report the consensus recommendations of that group and propose new definitions and grading for CRS and neurotoxicity that are objective, easy to apply, and ultimately more accurately categorize the severity of these toxicities.

In most of the reported cases, Cas9 was delivered into T cells  by way of electroporation with RNA or protein. However, transient expression of Cas9 by transfection with a plasmid encoding its gene is apparently simpler, as it avoids the steps of in vitro transcription of DNA or protein production. This  study tried nucleofection into human primary T cells of plasmids encoding both CRISPR/Cas9 for disrupting the PD-1 gene and the piggyBac transposon system for expressing CD133-specific CAR in one reaction. Based on drug selection, CD133-specific CAR T cells were obtained in which, on average, 91.5% of the PD-1  gene sites were disrupted, but almost no Cas9 gene expression was found in the final engineered CAR T cells. The PD-1-deficient CD133-specific CAR T cells showed similar levels of cytokine secretion and improved proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro, and enhanced inhibition of tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model of glioma, compared to conventional CD133-CAR T cells. The described  method could be useful for the production of PD-1-deficient CAR T cells for cancer immunotherapy.  DOI: 10.1089/hum.2017.234  PMID: 29706119    ""14.

PD-1 blockade could potentially enhance CAR T cell function. Here, we show that mesothelin is overexpressed in human triple-negative breast cancer cells and can be targeted by CAR T cells. To overcome the suppressive effect of PD-1 on CAR T cells, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein-mediated editing to disrupt the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) gene locus in human primary T cells, resulting in a significantly reduced PD-1hi population. This reduction had little effect on CAR  T cell proliferation but strongly augmented CAR T cell cytokine production and cytotoxicity towards PD-L1-expressing cancer cells in vitro. CAR T cells with PD-1 disruption show enhanced tumour control and relapse prevention in vivo when  compared with CAR T cells with or without αPD-1 antibody blockade.

These include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Although the IL-6R antagonist tocilizumab is approved for treatment of CRS, there is no approved treatment of neurotoxicity associated with CD19-targeted CAR-T (CART19)  cell therapy. Recent data suggest that monocytes and macrophages contribute to the development of CRS and neurotoxicity after CAR-T cell therapy. Therefore, we  investigated neutralizing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a potential strategy to manage CART19 cell-associated toxicities. In  this study, we show that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab does not inhibit CART19 cell function in vitro or in vivo. Moreover, CART19 cell proliferation was enhanced and durable control of leukemic disease was maintained better in patient-derived xenografts after GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab. In a patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenograft model of CRS and neuroinflammation (NI), GM-CSF neutralization resulted in a reduction of myeloid and T cell infiltration in the central nervous system and a significant reduction in NI and  prevention of CRS. Finally, we generated GM-CSF-deficient CART19 cells through CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of GM-CSF during CAR-T cell manufacturing. These GM-CSFk/o CAR-T cells maintained normal functions and had enhanced antitumor activity in vivo, as well as improved overall survival, compared with CART19 cells. Together, these studies illuminate a novel approach to abrogate NI and CRS through GM-CSF neutralization, which may potentially enhance CAR-T cell function.

Epub 2018 Oct 10.,Manufacture of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells from Mobilized Cyropreserved Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Units Depends on Monocyte Depletion.,"Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation can render lymphocyte repertoires qualitatively and quantitatively defective. Thus, heavily treated patients are often poor candidates for the manufacture of autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell products. In the United States and Europe, children with high-risk neuroblastoma undergo apheresis early in the course of treatment to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for cryopreservation in preparation for high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue. Here, we investigate whether these cryopreserved chemotherapy and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSCs can serve as starting material  for CAR-T cell manufacturing. We evaluated T cell precursor subsets in cryopreserved PBSC units from 8 patients with neuroblastoma using fluorescent activated cell sorting-based analysis. Every cryopreserved unit collected early in treatment contained both CD4 and CD8 precursors with significant numbers of naïve and central memory precursors. Significant numbers of Ki67+/PD1+ T cells were detected, presumably the result of chemotherapy-induced lymphopenia and subsequent homeostatic proliferation. Cryopreserved PBSC units containing 56 to 112 × 106 T cells were amenable to immunomagnetic selection, CD3 × 28 bead activation, lentiviral transduction, and cytokine-driven expansion, provided that CD14 monocytes were depleted before the initiation of cultures. Second- and third-generation CD171 CAR+ CD4 and CD8 effector cells derived from cryopreserved units displayed antineuroblastoma lytic potency and cytokine secretion comparable to those derived from a healthy donor and mediated in vivo antitumor regression in NSG mice. We conclude that cryopreserved PBSCs procured via standard methods during early treatment can serve as an alternative starting source for CAR-T cell manufacturing, extending the options for heavily treated patients.",CAR-T,2

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,CML Hematopoietic Stem Cells Expressing IL1RAP Can Be Targeted by Chimeric Antigen Receptor-Engineered T Cells.,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a chronic disease resulting in myeloid cell expansion through expression of the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have significantly increased survival of patients with CML, and  deep responders may consider stopping the treatment. However, more than 50% of patients relapse and restart TKI, subsequently suffering unknown toxicity. Because CML is a model immune system-sensitive disease, we hypothesize that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting IL1 receptor-associated protein (IL1RAP) in quiescent CML stem cells may offer an opportunity for a permanent cure. In this study, we produced and molecularly characterized a specific monoclonal anti-IL1RAP antibody from which fragment antigen-binding nucleotide coding sequences were cloned as a single chain into a lentiviral backbone and secured with the suicide gene iCASP9/rimiducid system. Our CAR T-cell therapy exhibited cytotoxicity against both leukemic stem cells and, to a lesser extent,  monocytes expressing IL1RAP, with no apparent effect on the hematopoietic system, including CD34+ stem cells. This suggests IL1RAP as a tumor-associated antigen for immunotherapy cell targeting. IL1RAP CAR T cells were activated in the presence of IL1RAP+ cell lines or primary CML cells, resulting in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and specifically killing in vitro and in a xenograft murine model. Overall, we demonstrate the proof of concept of a CAR T-cell immunotherapy approach in the context of CML that is applicable for young patients and primary TKI-resistant, intolerant, or allograft candidate patients.  SIGNIFICANCE: These findings present the first characterization and proof of concept of a chimeric antigen receptor directed against IL1RAP expressed by leukemic stem cells in the context of CML.",CAR-T,2

This approach offers researchers the capability to interrogate rare subpopulations of cells with minimal sample consumption and multiplexed readouts. Recent technological advances in the optical interrogation and manipulation of single cells have substantially increased the throughput and sensitivity of these assays. Areas covered: In this  review, the authors focus on three classes of single-cell imaging-based analyses: single-cell microscopy combined with microfluidics, mass spectrometric imaging for subcellular compound localization, and imaging mass cytometry (IMC). They provide an overview of each technology and recent examples of their utility in advancing drug discovery, based on the potential for scalability, multiplexing, and capability to generate definitive data on cellular heterogeneity and target engagement. Expert opinion: Understanding target engagement and heterogeneity at  the single-cell level will enable the development of safer and more effective therapies, particularly for new modalities like CAR-T cell therapies and gene editing approaches (AAV, CRISPR). Successful adoption of new single-cell imaging-based approaches in drug discovery will require tandem investment in advanced computational analysis and bioinformatic approaches, due to the complexity and multivariate nature of single-cell imaging data.",CAR-T,2

Previous studies have shown that mRNA CAR T cells are transiently effective but lack persistence and potency across tumor types. It was hypothesized that the efficacy of mRNA CARs could be improved by utilizing recent advancements in RNA technology, such as incorporating a modified nucleoside, 1-methylpseudouridine, into the mRNA and applying a novel purification method using RNase III to eliminate dsRNA contaminants. T cells electroporated with nucleoside-modified and purified mRNA encoding CD19 CAR showed an initial twofold increase in CAR surface expression, as well as a twofold improvement in cytotoxic killing of leukemia cells that persisted up to 5 days. T cells generated with nucleoside-modified and purified CAR mRNA also showed reduced expression of checkpoint regulators and a differential pattern of genetic activation compared to those made with conventional mRNA. In vivo studies using a leukemia mouse model revealed that the most robust 100-fold suppression of leukemic burden was achieved using T cells electroporated with purified mRNAs, regardless of their nucleoside modification.  The results provide a novel approach to generate mRNA for clinical trials, and poise mRNA CAR T cells for increased efficacy during testing as new CAR targets emerge.",CAR-T,2

There are now two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved products available for treating these patients, and a third product is expected to be approved in the coming months. The question remains: Is there a preferred or best product for my patient? However, answering  that question is more complicated than simply balancing the reported efficacy and toxicity results. DESIGN: This review outlines potential confounding factors involving the three products and their pivotal clinical trials and highlights additional considerations of manufacturing reliability and overall cost that must be considered when weighing one product against another. It will also review the directions in which the field is moving and strategies being examined to improve  efficacy as well as toxicity. CONCLUSION: Because a randomized three-arm clinical trial is unlikely, a product  may have to be chosen on the basis of results from treatment centers that have experience with all three products. But by the time those results are available,  they are likely to be outdated because, given the rapid evolution of the field, the next product will probably have been identified.",CAR-T,2

Despite recent improvements in the therapy of pancreatic cancer, initially with demonstration of the activity of the FOLFIRINOX regimen and subsequently the approval of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, prognosis remains poor and the 5-year survival rate is less than 5%. To date, neither personalized medicine nor  immunotherapy, the 2 recent revolutions of cancer treatment, have delivered major positive results in the treatment of pancreatic cancer; and it is especially clear that immune checkpoint inhibitors will not become a major tool in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. There are many ongoing studies, including those exploring combinations of chemotherapy with immunotherapy. Vaccines or T cells modified with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T cells) could also play a role in the treatment of cancer in the future.

Conventional treatment using chemo- and radiotherapy has limited efficacy with adverse events. Therapy with genetically engineered T-cells, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells,  may represent a promising approach to improve patient outcomes owing to their potential ability to attack highly infiltrative tumors in a tumor-specific manner and possible persistence of the adaptive immune response. However, the unique anatomical features of the brain and susceptibility of this organ to irreversible tissue damage have made immunotherapy especially challenging in the setting of glioma. With safety concerns in mind, multiple teams have initiated clinical trials using CAR T-cells in glioma patients. The valuable lessons learnt from those trials highlight critical areas for further improvement: tackling the issues of the antigen presentation and T-cell homing in the brain, immunosuppression in the glioma microenvironment, antigen heterogeneity and off-tumor toxicity, and the adaptation of existing clinical therapies to reflect  the intricacies of immune response in the brain. This review summarizes the up-to-date clinical outcomes of CAR T-cell clinical trials in glioma patients and examines the most pressing hurdles limiting the efficacy of these therapies. Furthermore, this review uses these hurdles as a framework upon which to evaluate cutting-edge pre-clinical strategies aiming to overcome those barriers.",CAR-T,2

Here, we utilized a cocktail of low-molecular-weight bispecific adapters, each comprised of fluorescein linked to a different tumor-specific ligand, to bridge between an antifluorescein CAR on the engineered T cell and a unique antigen on the cancer cell. This formation of an immunologic synapse between the  CAR T cell and cancer cell enabled use of a single antifluorescein CAR T cell to  eradicate a diversity of antigenically different solid tumors implanted concurrently in NSG mice. Based on these data, we suggest that a carefully designed cocktail of bispecific adapters in combination with antifluorescein CAR  T cells can overcome tumor antigen escape mechanisms that lead to disease recurrence following many CAR T-cell therapies.

The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel targets and eliminates CD19-expressing B cells and showed efficacy against B-cell lymphomas in a single-center, phase 2a study. METHODS: We conducted an international, phase 2, pivotal study of centrally manufactured tisagenlecleucel involving adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who were ineligible for or had disease progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The primary end point was the best overall response rate (i.e., the percentage of patients who had a complete or partial response), as judged by an independent review committee. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients received an infusion and were included in the evaluation of efficacy. The median time from infusion to data cutoff was 14 months (range, 0.1 to 26). The best overall response rate was 52% (95% confidence interval, 41 to 62); 40% of the patients had complete responses, and 12% had partial responses. Response rates were consistent across prognostic subgroups. At 12 months after the initial response, the rate of relapse-free survival was estimated to be 65% (79% among patients with a complete response). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events of special interest included cytokine release  syndrome (22%), neurologic events (12%), cytopenias lasting more than 28 days (32%), infections (20%), and febrile neutropenia (14%). Three patients died from  disease progression within 30 days after infusion. No deaths were attributed to tisagenlecleucel, cytokine release syndrome, or cerebral edema. No differences between response groups in tumor expression of CD19 or immune checkpoint-related  proteins were found. CONCLUSIONS: In this international study of CAR T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in adults, high rates of durable responses were produced with the use of tisagenlecleucel.

It has been reported to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon, skin, lung, gastric or bladder cancer. SFN is supposed to act primarily as an antioxidant due to the activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway. This enhances the activity of phase II detoxifying enzymes and the trapping of free radicals. Finally, SFN induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis of tumor cells. Here, we discuss effects of SFN on the immune defense system. In contrast to the situation in tumor cells, SFN acts pro-oxidatively in primary human T cells. It increases intracellular ROS levels and decreases GSH, resulting in inhibition of T cell activation and T cell effector functions. Regarding the use of SFN as an anticancer agent"" we conclude that SFN could act as a double-edged sword. On the one hand it reduces carcinogenesis",CAR-T,2

Limited evidence exists as to which CD16-CAR design and antibody partner might be most effective. We have hypothesised that the use of high-affinity CD16 variants, with increased Fc-terminus antibody affinity, combined with Fc-engineered antibodies, would provide superior CD16-CAR T cell efficacy. METHODS: CD16-CAR T (wild-type or variants) cells were co-cultured with Panc-1 pancreatic cancer, Raji lymphoma or A375 melanoma cells in the presence or absence of anti-CD20, anti-MCSP, wild-type or the glycoengineered antibody variants. The endpoints were proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity in vitro. RESULTS: The CD16 158 V variant of CD16-CAR T cells showed increased cytotoxic activity against all the tested cancer cells in the presence of the wild-type antibody directed against MCSP or CD20. Glycoengineered antibodies enhanced CD16-CAR T cell activity irrespective of CD16 polymorphisms as compared with the  wild-type antibody. The combination of the glycoengineered antibodies with the CD16-CAR 158 V variant synergised as seen by the increase in all endpoints.

Several factors are essential for CAR  T cell therapy to be effective, such as recruitment, activation, expansion and persistence of bioengineered T cells at the tumour site.

NKG2D-CAR products demonstrated a median 75% vector-driven NKG2D expression on CD3+ T cells. No dose-limiting toxicities, cytokine release syndrome, or CAR T cell-related neurotoxicity was observed. No significant autoimmune reactions were noted, and none of the ≥ grade 3 adverse events were attributable to NKG2D-CAR T cells. At the single injection of low cell doses used in this trial, no objective tumor responses were observed.

Although lymphodepletion is commonly used  to deplete Tregs, these regimens are nonspecific, toxic, and provide only a narrow window before Tregs repopulate hosts. Importantly, CARs have also been shown to inadvertently potentiate Tregs by providing a source of IL2 for Treg consumption. We explored whether disruption of the IL2 axis would confer efficacy against solid tumors without the need for lymphodepletion. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed second- (CD28z) and third- (CD28-4-1BBz) generation CARs targeting EGFRvIII. To eliminate secretion of IL2, 2 amino acid substitutions were introduced in the PYAP Lck-binding motif of the CD28 domain (ΔCD28). We evaluated CARs against B16 melanomas expressing EGFRvIII. RESULTS: CD28z CARs failed to engraft in vivo. Although 4-1BB addition improved expansion, CD28-4-1BBz CARs required lymphodepletion to treat solid tumors. CARs  deficient in Lck signaling, however, significantly retarded tumor growth without  a need for lymphodepletion and this was dependent on inclusion of 4-1BB. To evaluate CAR vulnerability to Tregs, we lymphodepleted mice and transferred CARs  alone or with purified Tregs. Cotransfer with Tregs abrogated the efficacy of CD28-4-1BBz CARs, whereas the efficacy of ΔCD28-4-1BBz CARs remained unperturbed. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of lymphodepletion, CARs targeting solid tumors are hindered by Treg immunosuppression and poor persistence. Here, CARs were modified to circumvent Treg suppression and to simultaneously improve in vivo engraftment. Modified CARs treated solid tumors without a need for lymphodepletion.",CAR-T,2

Epub 2018 Oct 15.,Plasma Exchange Can Be an Alternative Therapeutic Modality for Severe Cytokine Release Syndrome after Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cell Infusion: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND: Tumor immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor-T cells (CAR-T) is a promising new treatment for B-cell malignancies and has produced exciting results. However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is the most significant toxicity associated with this treatment and can be life-threatening. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old male patient had been diagnosed with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia. The patient was recruited into  our CAR-T clinical trial, and 1 × 106/kg of engineered anti-CD19 CAR-T cells was  administered. After infusion of CAR-T cells (day 0), the patient underwent a typical CRS reaction, with increases in fever, muscle soreness, and inflammatory  cytokines. He was treated with antiallergic and antipyretic drugs, glucocorticoids, and tocilizumab (4 mg/kg, days 3 and 5). However, CRS was not under control, and his condition rapidly deteriorated. He was transferred to the  intensive care unit, where dexamethasone 10 mg q6h was administered, and plasma exchange was performed, with 3,000 mL of plasma replaced by fresh frozen plasma per day for 3 consecutive days. His symptoms gradually improved, and the CRS-related symptoms were relieved. Additionally, a bone marrow smear showed no lymphoblast cells, and minimal residual disease was negative on day 28. The patient was eventually discharged in a normal condition. CONCLUSIONS: CRS is caused by an exaggerated systemic immune response, potentially resulting in organ damage that can be fatal. Although therapeutic plasma exchange is not included in CRS management guidelines, this case shows that plasma exchange is feasible in at least some patients with severe CRS.",CAR-T,2

Epub 2018 Dec 20.,Modeling anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in humanized mice with human immunity and autologous leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: Adoptive immunotherapy using T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) targeting CD19 has produced remarkable clinical outcomes. However, much of the mechanisms of action, such as the development of memory responses and sources of immune cytokines, remain elusive largely due to the challenge of characterizing human CAR T cell function in vivo. The lack of a suitable in vivo model also hinders the development of new CAR T cell therapies. METHODS: We established a humanized mouse (hu-mouse) model with a functional human immune system and genetically-matched (autologous) primary acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) that permits modeling of CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy in immunocompetent hosts without allogeneic or xenogeneic immune responses. FINDINGS: Anti-CD19 CAR T cells were detected in blood of leukemic hu-mice with kinetics and levels similar to those seen in patients receiving CAR T cell therapy. The levels of CAR T cells were correlated inversely with the burden of leukemia cells and positively with the survival times in anti-CD19 CAR T cell-treated leukemic hu-mice. Infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells also resulted in rapid production of T cell- and monocyte/macrophage-derived cytokines and an increase in frequency of regulatory T cells as reported in clinical studies. INTERPRETATION: These results provide a proof-of-principle that this novel preclinical model has the potential to be used to model human CAR T cell therapy  and facilitate the design of new CARs with improved antitumor activity.",CAR-T,2

Overcoming drug resistance and salvaging patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) MM is an urgent and unmet medical need. Several new personalized treatment  strategies have been developed against molecular targets to overcome this drug resistance. There are several targeted therapeutics with anti-MM activity in clinical pipeline, including inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins, monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, fusion proteins, and various cell therapy platforms. For example, B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-specific CAR-T cell platforms showed promising activity in heavily pretreated R/R MM patients. Therefore, there is renewed hope for high-risk as well as R/R MM patients in the era of personalized medicine.",CAR-T,2

Epub 2018 Nov 27.,Mesothelin-targeted second generation CAR-T cells inhibit growth of mesothelin-expressing tumors in vivo.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma are renowned for being diagnosed at a late stage and poor prognosis. Although surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have yielded successful outcomes, the improvement on the survival rate of NSCLC and mesothelioma have been less marked. Recently, adoptive immunotherapy, particularly chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy demonstrated promise for improving the survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with minimum toxicity. However, its application in solid tumors still warrants in-depth investigations and multiple consistent trial results, particularly in eliminating 'off-tumor' toxicity. To explore CAR-T therapy in NSCLC and mesothelioma, second-generation CAR-T cells were constructed targeting mesothelin (MSLN), which is abundant in NSCLC and mesothelioma but is under expressed in normal tissues. The second-generation design incorporated co-stimulatory CD28 and 4-1BB signaling domains to enhance the proliferation. Following the successful analysis of CAR-T cells by flow cytometry, cytotoxicity experiments were performed using the LDH kit to verify the killing effect of CAR-T cells on target cells. Otherwise, the in vivo killing tumor activity of MSLN CAR-T cells was verified by constructing a mouse model using tumor-derived cells from patients to inoculate the mice. When the effector-to-target ratio is >0.5:1, CAR-T MSLN cells exhibited significantly higher ability to kill tumor cells than T cells. In in vivo experiments, mice whose tail vein was injected with CAR-T MSLN cells demonstrated significantly slower tumor growth. Without continuous administration, both groups became gradually synchronized in growth of tumor size, which suggests that the persistence of CAR-T cells is an important issue in preclinical studies.",CAR-T,2

However, viral integration in T cells has the potential risk of  mutagenesis, and viral vector production demands effort and is costly. Using non-integrative episomal vector such as minicircle vector to generate integration-free CAR-T cells is an attractive option. METHODS AND RESULTS: We established a novel method to generate minicircle vector  within a few hours using simple molecular biology techniques. Since no bacteria is involved, we named these vectors bacteria-free (BF) minicircle. In comparison  with plasmids, BF minicircle vector enabled higher transgene expression and improved cell viability in human cell line, stem cells and primary T cells. Using BF minicircle vector, we generated integration-free CAR-T cells, which eliminated cancer cells efficiently both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: BF minicircle vector will be useful in basic research as well as in clinical applications such as CAR-T and gene therapy. Although the transgene expression of minicircle vector lasts apparently shorter than that of insertional lentivirus, multiple rounds of BF minicircle CAR-T cell infusion could eliminate  cancer cells efficiently. On the other hand, a relatively shorter CAR-T cell persistence provides an opportunity to avoid serious side effects such as cytokine storm or on-target off-tumour toxicity.",CAR-T,2

Epub 2018 Dec 2.,"Long-term safety and activity of axicabtagene ciloleucel in refractory large B-cell lymphoma (ZUMA-1): a single-arm, multicentre, phase 1-2 trial.","BACKGROUND: Axicabtagene ciloleucel is an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. In the previous analysis of the ZUMA-1 registrational study, with a median follow-up of 15·4 months (IQR 13·7-17·3), 89  (82%) of 108 assessable patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel achieved an objective response, and complete responses were noted in 63 (58%) patients. Here we report long-term activity and  safety outcomes of the ZUMA-1 study. METHODS: ZUMA-1 is a single-arm, multicentre, registrational trial at 22 sites in the USA and Israel. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and had histologically confirmed large B-cell lymphoma-including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, and transformed follicular lymphoma-according to the 2008 WHO Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and  Lymphoid Tissue; refractory disease or relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and had previously received an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing-regimen and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Participants received one dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel on day 0 at a target dose of 2 × 106 CAR T cells per kg of bodyweight after conditioning chemotherapy with intravenous fludarabine (30 mg/m2 body-surface area) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 body-surface area) on days -5, -4, and -3. The primary endpoints were safety for  phase 1 and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response for phase  2, and key secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival,  and duration of response. Pre-planned activity and safety analyses were done per  protocol. ZUMA-1 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02348216. Although the registrational cohorts are closed, the trial remains open, and recruitment to extension cohorts with alternative endpoints is underway. FINDINGS: Between May 19, 2015, and Sept 15, 2016, 119 patients were enrolled and 108 received axicabtagene ciloleucel across phases 1 and 2. As of the cutoff date of Aug 11, 2018, 101 patients assessable for activity in phase 2 were followed up for a median of 27·1 months (IQR 25·7-28·8), 84 (83%) had an objective response,  and 59 (58%) had a complete response. The median duration of response was 11·1 months (4·2-not estimable). The median overall survival was not reached (12·8-not estimable), and the median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 3·3-15·0). 52 (48%) of 108 patients assessable for safety in phases 1 and 2 had grade 3 or worse serious adverse events. Grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome occurred in 12 (11%) patients, and grade 3 or worse neurological events  in 35 (32%). Since the previous analysis at 1 year, additional serious adverse events were reported in four patients (grade 3 mental status changes, grade 4 myelodysplastic syndrome, grade 3 lung infection, and two episodes of grade 3 bacteraemia), none of which were judged to be treatment related. Two treatment-related deaths (due to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac  arrest) were previously reported, but no new treatment-related deaths occurred during the additional follow-up. INTERPRETATION: These 2-year follow-up data from ZUMA-1 suggest that axicabtagene ciloleucel can induce durable responses and a median overall survival of greater  than 2 years, and has a manageable long-term safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

Previously, we reported that the GM-CSF/JAK2/STAT3 axis drives liver-associated MDSC (L-MDSC) proliferation and blockade of this axis rescued antitumor immunity. We extended these findings in our murine liver metastasis (LM) model, by treating tumor-bearing mice with STAT3 inhibitors (STATTIC or BBI608) to further our understanding of how STAT3 drives L-MDSC suppressive function. STAT3 inhibition caused significant reduction of tumor burden as well as L-MDSC frequencies due to decrease in pSTAT3 levels. L-MDSC isolated from STATTIC or BBI608-treated mice had significantly reduced suppressive function. STAT3 inhibition of L-MDSC was associated with enhanced antitumor activity of CAR-T. Further investigation demonstrated activation of apoptotic signaling pathways in L-MDSC following STAT3 inhibition as evidenced by an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Accordingly, there was also a decrease of pro-survival markers, pErk and pAkt, and an increase in pro-death marker, Fas, with activation of downstream JNK and p38 MAPK. These findings represent a previously unrecognized link between STAT3 inhibition and Fas-induced apoptosis of MDSCs. Our findings suggest that inhibiting STAT3 has potential clinical application for enhancing the efficacy of CAR-T cells in LM through modulation of L-MDSC.",CAR-T,2

However, the two types of tumor are quite different in the following respects. Solid tumors are characterized by complex vasculatures and matrix barriers that significantly affect T-cell functions and migration. Moreover, various immunosuppressive molecules expressed in the tumor microenvironment can impede T-cell activation, and the high metabolic rate of tumors competitively suppresses the metabolism of immune cells. All these factors will exert their influences on  the development of a cancer, which is a dynamic balance between the host's immune system and the tumor. At present, solid tumors are treated primarily by surgical  resection combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a treatment process that is painful and not always effective. With advantages over traditional treatments, the recently developed CAR-T immunotherapy has been applied and has shown highly  promising results. Nevertheless, the complexity of solid tumors presents a great  challenge to this technique.

METHODS: We reviewed records of all patients from a single institution treated with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab from August 1, 2014 to April 1, 2017. RESULTS: Of 211 patients included in the study, 134 (63.5%) were treated with nivolumab and 77 (36.5%) with pembrolizumab. Thirty-five patients (16.4%) developed cutaneous AEs. Cutaneous AEs were significantly associated with longer treatment cycles (P = 0.001). The prevalence of cutaneous AEs did not differ between nivolumab (17.2%) and pembrolizumab (15.6%). Patient age, gender, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale and underlying malignancy were not associated with development of cutaneous AEs.

RESULTS: Of the 953 samples from Chinese cancer patients assessed in this study, 35% exhibited high TMB (TMB-H), 4% were positive for high MSI (MSI-H), dMMR occurred in 0.53%, and PD-L1 AMP was positive in 3.79%. We found higher rates of TMB-H among hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and esophageal cancer patients than was reported for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations had significantly lower TMB values than those with wild-type EGFR, and increased TMB was significantly associated with dMMR in colorectal cancer (CRC). The frequency of tumors with MSI-H was the highest in CRC and gastric cancer. PD-L1 AMP occurred most frequently in lung squamous cell carcinoma and HER2-positive breast cancer. While MSI and dMMR are associated with higher mutational loads, correlations between TMB-H and other biomarkers, between MSI-H and dMMR, and between PD-L1 AMP and other biomarkers were low, indicating different underlying causes of the four biomarkers. CONCLUSION: The results reveal the frequency of these biomarkers in different malignancies, with potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade use for Chinese patients with cancer.© 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: This prospective study of 42 patients treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor was approved by our institutional review board, and all patients gave written, informed consent. Tumor burden dynamics were assessed on F-FDG PET/CT before and after treatment initiation. Immunotherapeutic responses were evaluated according to RECIST 1.1, iRECIST, and PERCIST 1.0 for the dichotomous groups, responders versus nonresponders. Cohen κ and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to evaluate concordance among these criteria. We assessed progression-free survival and overall survival using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: The RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0 response classifications were discordant in 6 patients (14.2%; κ = 0.581). RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST were discordant in 2 patients, who evidenced pseudoprogression after treatment initiation. Median progression-free survival, as well as overall survival, was significantly longer for responders compared with nonresponders for all criteria (P < 0.001), with no significant difference between the 3 criteria (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0 show only moderate agreement, but both can predict treatment response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. In case of pseudoprogression, metabolic tumor activity may help to correctly classify treatment response.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Jun 6.,Functional systemic CD4 immunity is required for clinical responses to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy.,"The majority of lung cancer patients progressing from conventional therapies are refractory to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade monotherapy. Here, we show that baseline systemic CD4 immunity is a differential factor for clinical responses. Patients with functional systemic CD4 T cells included all objective responders and could be identified before the start of therapy by having a high proportion of memory CD4 T cells. In these patients, CD4 T cells possessed significant proliferative capacities, low co-expression of PD-1/LAG-3 and were responsive to PD-1 blockade ex vivo and in vivo. In contrast, patients with dysfunctional systemic CD4 immunity did not respond even though they had lung cancer-specific T cells. Although proficient in cytokine production, CD4 T cells in these patients proliferated very poorly, strongly co-upregulated PD-1/LAG-3, and were largely refractory to PD-1 monoblockade. CD8 immunity only recovered in patients with functional CD4 immunity. T-cell proliferative dysfunctionality could be reverted by PD-1/LAG-3 co-blockade. Patients with functional CD4 immunity and PD-L1 tumor positivity exhibited response rates of 70%, highlighting the contribution of CD4 immunity for efficacious PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

Infection of breast and renal tumor cells with rAd.sT produced sTGFβRIIFc protein with dose-dependent cytotoxicity. In immunocompetent mouse 4T1 breast tumor model, intratumoral delivery of rAd.sT inhibited both tumor growth and lung metastases. rAd.sT downregulated the expression of several transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) target genes involved in tumor growth and metastases, inhibited Th2 cytokine expression, and induced Th1 cytokines and chemokines, and granzyme B and perforin expression. rAd.sT treatment also increased the percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes, promoted the generation of CD4+ T memory cells, reduced regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), and reduced bone marrow-derived suppressor cells. Importantly, rAd.sT treatment increased the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes, and promoted differentiation and maturation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells in the spleen. In the immunocompetent mouse Renca renal tumor model, similar therapeutic effects and immune activation results were observed. In the 4T1 mammary tumor model, rAd.sT improved the inhibition of tumor growth and lung and liver metastases by anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Analysis of the human breast and kidney tumors showed that a significant number of tumor tissues expressed high levels of TGFβ and TGFβ-inducible genes. Therefore, rAd.sT could be a potential enhancer of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy for treating breast and kidney cancers.",PD-L1,3

Materials & methods: We evaluated interactions according to type of treatment-add-on strategy: immunotherapy in combination versus standard chemotherapy-based regimens. Hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were extracted and cumulated. Results: Seven trials (4278 patients) were included. The addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy-based regimens significantly increased OS (HR 0.74; p = 0.001) and PFS (HR 0.61; p < 0.0001) compared with standard-of-care in NSCLC patients in first-line setting. Conclusion: Immunotherapy-based regimens constantly improved OS and PFS compared with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of nononcogene-addicted NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 May 3.,Safety evaluation of nivolumab added concurrently to radiotherapy in a standard first line chemo-radiotherapy regimen in stage III non-small cell lung cancer-The ETOP NICOLAS trial.,"OBJECTIVES: Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) and concurrent PD-1 inhibition has shown promising results in pre-clinical models. So far, the feasibility of delivering concurrent CRT and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has never been assessed in a clinical trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: NICOLAS is a phase-II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of nivolumab combined with CRT in stage III NSCLC. Patients received 3 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy and concurrent RT (66 Gy/33fractions). Nivolumab started concurrently with RT. The primary endpoint was 6-month post-RT rate of grade-≥3-pneumonitis. A formal interim safety analysis (IA) was scheduled when the first 21 patients reached 3 months follow-up post-RT. An early positive safety conclusion would be reached at IA if there were no grade ≥3-pneumonitis in those patients. Efficacy evaluation was planned provided the safety conclusion was reached. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: As of 13 December 2018, 82 patients were recruited with median follow-up of 13.4 months. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were anaemia, fatigue and pneumonitis. No unexpected AEs or increased toxicities were observed. For the first 21 patients, no grade-≥3-pneumonitis was observed by the end of the 3-month post-RT follow-up period. The early safety IA provides evidence that the addition of nivolumab to concurrent CRT is safe and tolerable regarding the 6-month rate of pneumonitis grade ≥3 at the one-sided significance level of 5%. Following that, the 1-year progression-free survival will be evaluated in an expanded patient cohort. NICOLAS trial creates the opportunity for assessing the activity of the combination of checkpoint with concurrent CRT in larger prospective trials for locally advanced NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Apr 27.,Correlation between serum adenosine deaminase activity and efficacy of anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody.,"OBJECTIVE: Serum adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity is a marker of immune reaction to several diseases. We evaluated changes in serum ADA in patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy or anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) therapy to examine the correlation between serum ADA and the therapy efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 50 patients with advanced lung cancer receiving chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 therapy. Serum ADA was measured before and on day 7 of the first treatment cycle and day 0 of subsequent cycles. Correlations between ADA change and efficacy of treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 20 were treated with chemotherapy and 30 were treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. Serum ADA decreased significantly between baseline and day 7 of the first cycle in patients undergoing chemotherapy, regardless of response (partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]: -23% [-38 to +32; p =  0.002]; progressive disease [PD]: -12% [-42 to +6; p =  0.500]). Conversely, in patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy, serum ADA increased significantly between baseline and 7 days after the first dose and before subsequent doses in patients who had PR or SD. (day 7 of first cycle: +6% [-10 to +34; p =  0.034], day 0 of second cycle: 8% [-5 to +37; p =  0.002], day 0 of third cycle: 9% [-3 to +55; p =  0.002]). However, serum ADA did not significant change in PD patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy. Furthermore, early increases in serum ADA were associated with longer progression-free survival in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy (p =  0.006). CONCLUSION: Changes in serum ADA could be used to predict clinical benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with lung cancer. The association between changes in serum ADA and the efficacy of ant-PD-1 therapy thus remains inconclusive and requires further study.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 May 15.,Impact of KRAS mutation subtype and concurrent pathogenic mutations on non-small cell lung cancer outcomes.,"OBJECTIVES: Concurrent genetic mutations are prevalent in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and may differentially influence patient outcomes. We sought to characterize the effects of KRAS mutation subtypes and concurrent pathogenic mutations on overall survival (OS) and PD-L1 expression, a predictive biomarker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC at a single institution and abstracted clinical, molecular, and pathologic data from electronic health records. Cox regression and multinomial logistic regression were used to determine how KRAS mutation subtypes and concurrent pathogenic mutations are associated with OS and tumor PD-L1 expression, respectively. RESULTS: A total 186 patients were included. Common KRAS mutation subtypes included G12C (35%) and G12D (17%). Concurrent pathogenic mutations were identified in TP53 (39%), STK11 (12%), KEAP1 (8%), and PIK3CA (4%). On multivariable analysis, KRAS G12D mutations were significantly associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-5.16; P = 0.021), as were STK11 co-mutations (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.27-6.88; P = 0.012). Compared to no (<1%) PD-L1 expression, KRAS G12C mutations were significantly associated with positive yet low (1-49%) PD-L1 expression (odds ratio [OR] 4.94, 95% CI 1.07-22.85; P = 0.041), and TP53 co-mutations with high (≥50%) PD-L1 expression (OR 6.36, 95% CI 1.84-22.02; P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: KRAS G12D and STK11 mutations confer poor prognoses for patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC. KRAS G12C and TP53 mutations correlate with a biomarker that predicts benefit from immunotherapy. Concurrent mutations may represent distinct subsets of KRAS-mutant NSCLC; further investigation is warranted to elucidate their role in guiding treatment.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 May 4.,Understanding and overcoming the resistance of cancer to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.,"Greater understanding of tumour immunobiology has led to a new era of cancer treatment in which immuno-oncology (IO) therapies are used to boost anti-cancer immune responses. Prominent among these therapies are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), antibody-based drugs that can unleash the power of tumour-specific CD8 + T-cells. ICIs targeting the Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) cell surface receptor or its ligand PD-L1 are particularly effective, with clinical studies reporting powerful and durable therapeutic impact against many cancer types, including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. ICIs have the potential to transform the landscape of cancer treatment, and their development was recognised by the award of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to James Allison and Tasuku Honjo. However, the proportion of patients responding to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy can be low. The next major challenge involves understanding and overcoming the innate and acquired resistance that prevents most patients from responding to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. In this review, we outline the physiological function of PD-1 and its exploitation by developing tumours. We give an overview of current FDA-approved drugs targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 and summarise clinical progress so far. We then discuss key mechanisms thought to underpin resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, describing biomarkers that could allow patient responses to be predicted before treatment, and tracked once treatment has started. We also present clinical and pre-clinical combination therapies that have been developed to overcome resistance and which have the potential to substantially extend the therapeutic reach of these revolutionary drugs.",PD-L1,3

This study aimed to assess clinical characteristics of PD-L1 expression using immunohistochemistry among Korean patients with lung cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with pathologically proven lung cancer from a single institution. PD-L1 expression determined by Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) was detected using 22C3 pharmDx (Agilent Technologies) and SP263 (Ventana Medical Systems) assays. RESULTS: From July 2016 to July 2017, 267 patients were enrolled. The main histologic type was adenocarcinoma (69.3%). Most participants were smokers (67.4%) and had clinical stage IV disease (60.7%). In total, 116 (42%) and 58 (21%) patients had TPS ≥1% and ≥50%, respectively. The patients were significantly older in TPS ≥1% group than in TPS <1% group (64.83±9.38 years vs. 61.73±10.78 years, p=0.014), not in TPS ≥50% cutoff value (64.69 ± 9.39 vs. 62.36 ± 10.51, p= 0.178). Regarding histologic grade, higher proportions of poorly differentiated tumor were observed in the TPS ≥1% (40.8% vs. 25.8%, p=0.020) and TPS ≥50% groups (53.2% vs. 27.2%, p=0.004). Among 34 patients examined with 22C3 and SP263 assays, 27 had positive results in both assays, with a cutoff of TPS ≥1% (r=0.826; 95% confidence interval, 0.736-0.916). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression, defined as TPS ≥1%, was related to older age and poorly differentiated histology. There was a similar distribution of PD-L1 expression in both 22C3 and SP263 results.",PD-L1,3

These therapies work by reactivating the immune system and enabling it to target cancer cells once more. There is a general agreement that expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells predicts the therapeutic response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in NSCLC. Hence, immunohistochemical staining of tumour tissue biopsies from NSCLC patients with PD-L1 antibodies is the current standard used to aid selection of patients for treatment with anti-PD-1 as first line therapy. However, issues of small tissue samples, tissue heterogeneity, the emergence of new metastatic sites, and dynamic changes in the expression of PD-L1 may influence PD-L1 status during disease evolution. Re-biopsy would expose patients to the risk of complications and tardy results. Analysis of PD-L1 expression on circulating tumour cells (CTCs) may provide an accessible and non-invasive means to select patients for anti-PD-1 therapies. Additionally, CTCs could potentially provide a useful biomarker in their own right. Several published studies have assessed PD-L1 expression on CTCs from NSCLC patients. Overall, analysis of PD-L1 on CTCs is feasible and could be detected prior to and after frontline therapy. However, there is no evidence on whether PD-L1 expression on CTCs could predict the response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. This review examines the challenges that need to be addressed to demonstrate the clinical validity of PD-L1 analysis in CTCs as a biomarker capable of predicting the response to immune checkpoint blockade.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Gr-MDSC-linked asset as a potential immune biomarker in pretreated NSCLC receiving nivolumab as second-line therapy.,"PURPOSE: Immunotherapy is a new standard first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with high programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (≥ 50%) and second-line treatment regardless of PD-L1 status, though not all patients benefit from this approach. Much effort is ongoing to identify robust prognostic and predictive biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, overcoming PD-L1 that appears limited in its ability to discriminate patient candidates to this new class of anticancer agents. The purpose of this research study is to identify potential new biomarkers for immunotherapy in lung cancer. METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab were enrolled in the study. All the patients received a blood analysis looking for the relationship between different populations of baseline white blood cells and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Gr-MDSC) detected by flow cytometry, to identify and characterize patients with poor likelihood of benefit from nivolumab in NSCLC second-line setting, regardless of clinical feature and PDL1 expression. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that high baseline levels of Gr-MDSC and low baseline CD8/Gr-MDSC ratio are associated with significantly better (P = 0.02) response to immunotherapy treatment. Log-rank tests suggested a significant improvement in OS and PFS with high baseline levels of Gr-MDSC levels (≥ 6 cell/μl), low absolute neutrophil count (< 5840/μl), high eosinophil count (> 90 /μl), and NLR < 3. The multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant improvement for PFS (P = 0.003) and OS (P = 0.05) in favour of the identified good prognostic Gr-MDSC-linked asset group, compared with the poor prognosis group. CONCLUSION: The role of Gr-MDSC appears interesting as a potential biomarker in NSCLC patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Further analyses are needed to confirmed and study in deep the role of these particular cells and their role in cancer response and progression during ICI therapy.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Prospects for a personalized peptide vaccine against lung cancer.,"Introduction: The tumor characteristics and immunological status of the host should be carefully considered for the successful development of cancer peptide vaccines. Recently, personalized peptide vaccines (PPV) that individually select antigens for each patient are being developed for lung cancer. Areas covered: Novel PPV, in which appropriate vaccine antigens are selected in each patient by assessing preexisting immunity to a panel of vaccine peptide candidates, have been attempted with promising results in early-phase clinical trials for lung cancer. Additionally, PPV targeting neo-antigens derived from genetic mutations have been currently attempted with high anticipation of success in various cancers, because they can be recognized as foreign by the host immune system. In this review, we present an overview of the current progress and future directions of such PPV for patients with lung cancer. Expert opinion: Both genetic characterization of tumor cells and assessment of the immune responses to potential tumor antigens might be a key component for facilitating successful cancer vaccine development. In addition, not only selection of immunogenic epitopes, but also appropriate modulation of the host immunological status should be considered; clinical trials combining neo-antigen vaccines and anti-PD-1 antibodies for lung cancer are currently ongoing and their results are awaited.",PD-L1,3

Despite becoming the standard of care in certain clinical settings, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, a proportion of patients do not respond while others actually progress during treatment. Therefore, there is a clinical need to identify accurate predictive biomarkers and to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on ICIs. Although they have limitations, the current markers evaluated to select which patients will undergo ICI treatment are the levels of PD-L1 and the tumor mutational burden. In this paper we describe what is currently known about the dynamic interaction between the cancer cell and the immune system during carcinogenesis, with a particular focus on the description of the functions and gene alterations that preclude the host immunoresponse in NSCLC. We emphasize the deleterious gene alterations in components of the major histocompatibility complex (HLA-I or B2M) and of the response to IFNγ (such as JAK2) which are mutually exclusive and can affect up to one fifth of the NSCLCs. The participation of other gene alterations, such as those of common oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and of the epigenetic alterations will also be discussed, in detail. Finally, we discuss the potential use of the tumors genetic profile to predict sensitivity to ICIs.",PD-L1,3

The current study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of PD-L1 immunostaining and quantitation on direct Papanicolaou-stained cytological smears compared with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (cytological cell blocks and surgical resection specimens) in NSCLC cases using 2 commercially available assays: the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent Technologies/Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and the Ventana SP263 Assay (Ventana Medical Systems Inc, Tucson, Arizona). METHODS: PD-L1 immunostaining using either both or one of the assays was tested in 117 sets of paired samples obtained from 62 NSCLC cases. The tumor proportion score was reported in every case following the recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). RESULTS: In 57 sets of samples, both PD-L1 assays were used. Due to the availability of samples, only 1 assay was performed in 3 sets of samples and in 2 cases, only cytology smears were used and tested for both assays. A total of 113 sets of paired samples finally were evaluated; 4 cases could not be studied due to intense nonspecific background staining. A significant concordance between the 2 assays on cytological smears was found. Concordance between paired cytological smears and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples was observed in 97.3% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: The quantification of PD-L1 expression on direct Papanicolaou-stained cytology smears is feasible and reliable for both PD-L1 assays. © 2019 American Cancer Society.",PD-L1,3

We report the demographic characteristics, CD4 T cell counts, HIV viral loads, safety and efficacy data of these 23 PLWHIV treated in routine practice with nivolumab or pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer (n = 21), melanoma (n = 1) and head and neck cancer (n = 1) retrospectively collected from the database CANCERVIH network. The median CD4 T cell count at treatment initiation was 370/mm (IQR: 125-1485). HIV viral load was undetectable in all patients. RESULTS: As of 29 April 2019, with a median follow-up of 10.8 months (2.0-27.7), the median number of injections was 6 (IQR: 4-18). Only two grade 3 adverse reactions were reported (no toxic deaths or immune-related deaths). Among the 23 patients, a partial response was observed in 5 patients (22%), a stabilization for 5 (22%) and a progression in 13 (57%). Only one patient experienced a positive HIV viral load, but this occurred following ART interruption. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with PD-1 inhibitors seems to have an efficacy signal and be well tolerated in PLWHIV, including impact on CD4 lymphocyte count and HIV load, that should be monitored during treatment course (regarding real-life experience).",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Efficacy of chemotherapy after progression with nivolumab in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,"Nivolumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has shown promising results against squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in cases of recurrence or in a metastatic setting after platinum-based therapy. However, treatment alternatives for patients with nivolumab-refractory are limited, and a constant opinion is not provided. Recently, accumulating studies have demonstrated that chemotherapy after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment may induce better objective responses in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, there are few reports on the increased effect of chemotherapy after nivolumab treatment in SCCHN. Therefore, cases must be accumulated to identify patients with nivolumab-refractory SCCHN who may benefit from chemotherapy. Here, we present patients with SCCHN who exhibited a significant response to chemotherapy after nivolumab treatment.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Anti-PD-1 versus anti-PD-L1 therapy in patients with pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis.,"Aim: At present three immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), two anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and one anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab) can be used in pretreated non-small-cell lung cancer patients. The aim of this meta-analysis is an indirect comparison between anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 inhibitors. Methods: Seven studies (>4000 patients) were considered. Results: Considering the overall survival ICIs showed very robust efficacy over docetaxel, while in terms of progression-free survival the therapy with ICIs is slightly favored. Anti-PD-1 gives a more significant benefit than anti-PD-L1; however, excluding the KEYNOTE 010 trial that enrolled only PD-L1-positive patients, the subgroup difference remains only in terms of progression-free survival. Conclusion: This meta-analysis confirms the superiority of ICIs over docetaxel in pretreated non-small-cell lung cancer patients and would indicate a slight benefit from anti-PD-1 than from anti-PD-L1 inhibitors, always keeping in mind the possible biases of this indirect comparison.",PD-L1,3

In this study, we developed a quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) model to represent the anti-tumor immune response in human NSCLC that integrated our knowledge of tumor growth, antigen processing and presentation, T cell activation and distribution, antibody pharmacokinetics, and immune checkpoint dynamics. The model was calibrated with the available data and was used to identify potential biomarkers as well as patient-specific response based on the patient parameters. The model predicted that in addition to tumor mutational burden (TMB), a known biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC, the number of effector T cells and regulatory T cells in the tumor and blood is a predictor of the responders. Furthermore, the model simulated a set of 12 patients with known TMB and MHC/antigen-binding affinity from a recent clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02259621) on neoadjuvant nivolumab therapy in resectable lung cancer and predicted an augmented durable response in patients with adjuvant nivolumab treatment in addition to the clinical trial protocol of neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment followed by resection. Overall, the model provides a valuable framework to model tumor immunity and response to immune checkpoint blockers to enhance biomarker discovery and performing virtual clinical trials to aid in design and interpretation of the current trials with fewer patients.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Pre-existing interstitial lung abnormalities are risk factors for immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced interstitial lung disease in non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients develop immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced interstitial lung disease (ICI-ILD), 10% of whom die. However, there are no established risk factors for its occurrence. Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) are areas of increased lung density on lung computed tomography (CT) in individuals with no known ILD. This study retrospectively investigated whether any patient characteristics, including ILA, were risk factors for ICI-ILD in patients with NSCLC. METHODS: NSCLC patients who received anti-programmed death (PD)-1 antibody treatment at our hospital between September 2015 and December 2017 were enrolled. Information on patient characteristics before anti-PD-1 antibody administration, including chest CT findings and laboratory data, were obtained. RESULTS: Among 83 enrolled patients, the incidence of ICI-ILD was 16.9% (14/83). All ICI-ILD cases developed by the third line of treatment. The incidence of ICI-ILD was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing ILA than that in those without (p = 0.007). Furthermore, patients with ground glass attenuation (GGA) in ILA had a higher incidence of ICI-ILD than that in those without (p < 0.001). In univariate logistic analysis, ILA were significant risk factors for ICI-ILD (p = 0.005). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that only GGA in ILA was a significant risk factor for ICI-ILD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing ILA are risk factors for ICI-ILD and GGA in ILA is an independent risk factor for ICI-ILD. Therefore, we should be more aware of the development of ICI-ILD in patients with ILA, especially those with GGA.",PD-L1,3

Is it ready for prime-time use for cancer patients?,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of immunotherapy in oncology requires the discovery, validation and subsequent adoption of robust, sensitive and specific predictive and prognostic biomarkers for daily practice. Until now, anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue sections has been the only validated companion diagnostic test for first-line immunotherapy for advanced and metastatic cancer, notably non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, detection of this biomarker presents limitations which have stimulated the development of other biomarkers and other approaches. Within this context, the use of a liquid biopsy (LB) could provide an important complementary or alternative added value to PD-L1 IHC. DESIGN: In this review, we discuss how liquid biopsies (LBs) have been used in the field of immuno-oncology (I-O) to predict response, relapse or adverse advents for patients undergoing immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy (anti PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) and we highlight recent developments. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), proteins and cytokines detected in plasma as well as circulating T-lymphocytes are discussed as potential sources for developing new I-O biomarkers. RESULTS: The quantification of cfDNA as a predictive biomarker, as well as its sequencing for the determination of tumor mutational burden (TMB), is already well advanced. Additionally, the quantification of PD-L1 from CTCs, bound on exosomes or free in plasma, as well as the determination of cytokines, are also being actively investigated with promising results having recently been published. Lastly, analysis of T-lymphocytes, especially by analyzing the T-cell receptor, has recently emerged as a valuable biomarker that might become relevant for the prediction of response to ICIs. CONCLUSION: While LBs have not yet been implemented in routine I-O clinical practice, recent promising data and rapidly advancing technologies indicate that this approach has the potential to soon personalize the clinical management of cancer patients receiving ICIs.© The Author 2019.

[Epub ahead of print],The Immune Response-related Mutational Signatures and Driver Genes in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable clinical benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but our understanding of biomarkers that predict response to ICB remained obscure. Here we integrated somatic mutational profile and clinicopathologic information from 113 NSCLC patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (CTLA-4/PD-1). High tumor mutation burden (TMB) and neoantigen burden were identified significantly associated with improved efficacy in NSCLC immunotherapy. Furthermore, we identified APOBEC mutational signature was markedly associated with responding of ICB therapy (log-rank test, p = 0.001; OR, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.06-0.50], p < 0.001). The association with progression-free survival remained statistically significant after controlling for age, sex, histological type, smoke, PD-L1 expression, hypermutation, smoking signature and MMR (HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.75], p = 0.010). Combined high TMB with APOBEC signature preferably predict immunotherapy responders in NSCLC cohort. The CIBERSORT algorithm revealed that high APOBEC mutational activity samples were associated with increased infiltration of CD4 memory activated T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells, but reduced infiltration of regulatory T cells. Besides, individual genes mutation of IFNGR1 or VTCN1 were only found in responders, however, PTEN mutation was only found in non-responders (Fishers exact test, all p < 0.05). These findings may be applicable for guiding immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",PD-L1,3

However, the molecular characteristics that drive their efficient immune response to tumors are poorly understood. Here, single-cell and bulk transcriptomic analysis of TRM and non-TRM cells present in tumor and normal lung tissue from patients with lung cancer revealed that PD-1-expressing TRM cells in tumors were clonally expanded and enriched for transcripts linked to cell proliferation and cytotoxicity when compared with PD-1-expressing non-TRM cells. This feature was more prominent in the TRM cell subset coexpressing PD-1 and TIM-3, and it was validated by functional assays ex vivo and also reflected in their chromatin accessibility profile. This PD-1+TIM-3+ TRM cell subset was enriched in responders to PD-1 inhibitors and in tumors with a greater magnitude of CTL responses. These data highlight that not all CTLs expressing PD-1 are dysfunctional; on the contrary, TRM cells with PD-1 expression were enriched for features suggestive of superior functionality.© 2019 Clarke et al.",PD-L1,3

This study aimed to investigate these markers in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) biopsies from patients with stage IIIB or IV ADC with little or no smoking history, to investigate their prognostic value and to correlate these results with the presence of driver mutations in the tumors. TIL were retrospectively evaluated on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides from 152 tumor samples. PD-1/PD-L1 expression was retrospectively evaluated with PD-1/PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) double staining on 74 tumor samples with sufficient residual tissue. PD-L1 expression was analysed on stromal cells of the tumor compartment, the tumor cells and TIL and PD-1 on TIL. Median overall survival (OS) was longer in patients with high stromal TIL infiltration compared to patients with low stromal TIL infiltration (68 weeks vs. 35 weeks respectively; p = 0.003). This was observed most prominently in KRAS mutant tumors (95 weeks vs. 12 weeks; p = 0.003). Only PD-L1 expression on tumor stromal cells influenced OS and indicated a worse prognosis (77 weeks vs 25 weeks; p = 0.013). Stromal TIL counts nor PD-1/PD-L1 expression levels were associated with the presence of driver mutations. The results of the current study reinforce the prognostic role of TIL in lung ADC, which is most prominent in KRAS mutant cancers. The results of the PD-1/PD-L1 analysis suggest that stromal cells can effectively suppress the anti-tumor immune response via the PD-L1 pathway.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Epigenetic signature of PD-1+ TCF1+ CD8 T cells that act as resource cells during chronic viral infection and respond to PD-1 blockade.,"We have recently defined a novel population of PD-1 (programmed cell death 1)+ TCF1 (T cell factor 1)+ virus-specific CD8 T cells that function as resource cells during chronic LCMV infection and provide the proliferative burst seen after PD-1 blockade. Such CD8 T cells have been found in other chronic infections and also in cancer in mice and humans. These CD8 T cells exhibit stem-like properties undergoing self-renewal and also differentiating into the terminally exhausted CD8 T cells. Here we compared the epigenetic signature of stem-like CD8 T cells with exhausted CD8 T cells. ATAC-seq analysis showed that stem-like CD8 T cells had a unique signature implicating activity of HMG (TCF) and RHD (NF-κB) transcription factor family members in contrast to higher accessibility to ETS and RUNX motifs in exhausted CD8 T cells. In addition, regulatory regions of the transcription factors Tcf7 and Id3 were more accessible in stem-like cells whereas Prdm1 and Id2 were more accessible in exhausted CD8 T cells. We also compared the epigenetic signatures of the 2 CD8 T cell subsets from chronically infected mice with effector and memory CD8 T cells generated after an acute LCMV infection. Both CD8 T cell subsets generated during chronic infection were strikingly different from CD8 T cell subsets from acute infection. Interestingly, the stem-like CD8 T cell subset from chronic infection, despite sharing key functional properties with memory CD8 T cells, had a very distinct epigenetic program. These results show that the chronic stem-like CD8 T cell program represents a specific adaptation of the T cell response to persistent antigenic stimulation.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Cancer outcomes in patients requiring immunosuppression in addition to corticosteroids for immune-related adverse events after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.,"AIM: To examine the cancer-specific outcomes for patients who experience immune-related adverse events requiring immunosuppression beyond corticosteroids. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of patients between January 1, 2009 and April 1, 2018, across three metropolitan hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia. Eligible patients were identified from pharmacy records. Patients with a solid organ malignancy had discontinued checkpoint inhibitor therapy due to toxicity, and required immunosuppression in addition to corticosteroids to treat any immune-related adverse event. RESULTS: From 3860 patient dispensation records of immunosuppressive medications, 19 eligible patients were identified. Eight received a CTLA-4 inhibitor, four a PD-1 inhibitor, five combination immunotherapy, and two remained blinded. Sixteen patients had melanoma and three had non-small cell lung cancer. Median time to treatment failure was 8.7 months, and median overall survival was 9.4 months. Of those evaluable, the objective response rate was 35%, while 53% had progressive disease. Four patients died due to complications of their irAE, while six died from progressive disease. CONCLUSION: Patients who received immunosuppression for checkpoint inhibitor therapy toxicity had variable outcomes. This in part reflects a heterogeneous population, and the evolution of irAE management over time. Several patients continued to derive a benefit after cessation of therapy despite the use of immunosuppressive medications; conversely, four died as a direct consequence of their irAE. Physicians should promptly introduce immunosuppressive therapy in patients not responding to corticosteroids to mitigate the risk of life-threatening adverse events, given that current evidence does not clearly demonstrate a detriment to cancer-specific outcomes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",PD-L1,3

Here we report safety and clinical activity in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort of a Phase 1/2 trial that included multiple tumor types (Study 1108; NCT01693562). METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous) received durvalumab 10 mg/kg q2w for 12 months or until confirmed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were safety and antitumor activity. Tumoral PD-L1 expression was assessed using the VENTANA SP263 Assay. Responses were assessed by blinded independent central review (RECIST v1.1). Adverse events were graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03. RESULTS: Of 304 patients, 79.0% were previously treated. Confirmed objective response rate was 21.8% in patients with ≥25% PD-L1 expression and 6.4% in those with <25%; 25.9% in first-line patients and 12.7% in previously treated patients; 14.0% in squamous and 16.7% in nonsquamous disease. Median OS was 12.4 months and median PFS was 1.7 months; both were numerically longer in the PD-L1 ≥25% group than in the PD-L1 <25% group (OS 16.4 vs 7.6 months; PFS 2.6 vs 1.4 months). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 57.2%, were Grade 3/4 in 10.2%, and led to discontinuation in 5.6%. One patient (0.3%) died of treatment-related pneumonia with underlying pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: Durvalumab was clinically active irrespective of histology in this mostly pretreated population, with a manageable safety profile. Response rates and survival appeared to be enhanced in patients with greater tumoral PD-L1 expression.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Immuno-Oncological Treatment and Tumor Mass in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Case-Control Analysis of Overall Survival in Routine Clinical Practice.,"BACKGROUND: Immuno-oncological (IO) therapies such as PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have been introduced in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since 2015 based on randomized trials showing unprecedented advantages in overall survival (OS) with hazard ratios (HRs) between 0.5 and 0.7. The impact of these treatments on OS in routine clinical practice and the role of tumor mass have not been studied. METHODS: 557 consecutive patients with inoperable stage III or stage IV NSCLC diagnosed in our certified lung cancer center from 2006 to 2018 were included if they had received at least one line of systemic treatment. OS of immuno-oncologically treated patients (IO patients, n = 144) who received treatment with a PD-1 antibody (nivolumab [n = 77] or pembrolizumab [n = 51]) or a PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab [n = 4] or durvalumab [n = 12]) was compared to historic controls treated before availability of IO treatment (n = 413) using case-control analysis. IO patients and historic controls were individually matched for stage, performance state, histology, smoking status, gender, age, and initial treatment mode (palliative vs. definitive radio-chemotherapy). RESULTS: Case-control analysis of 91 matched pairs showed significantly longer OS in IO patients compared to historic controls (21.2 vs. 10.9 months, HR 0.526, CI 0.373-0.723). The benefit was more pronounced in patients with lower tumor stage (HR 0.48 [stage III], 0.40 [IVA], 0.63 [IVB]) or smaller tumor size (HR 0.38 [RECIST ≤57 mm], 0.40 [RECIST 58-94 mm], 0.59 [RECIST 95-141 mm], 0.75 [RECIST ≥142 mm]). CONCLUSIONS: IO patients showed significant benefit in OS with HRs comparable to those reported in phase III trials. The benefit tended to be greater in patients with lower tumor mass.© 2019 S.

We investigated the correlation between 18F-FDG PET/CT-based markers and tumour tissue expression of PD-L1, necrosis and clinical outcome in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor treatment. METHODS: PD-Li expression in biopsy or resection specimens from 49 patients with confirmed NSCLC was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were obtained from 18F-FDG PET/CT images. The ratio of metabolic to morphological lesion volumes (MMVR) and its association with PD-L1 expression in each lesion were calculated. The associations between histologically reported necrosis and 18F-FDG PET imaging patterns and radiological outcome (evaluated by iRECIST) following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy were also analysed. In 14 patients, the association between necrosis and MMVR and tumour immune contexture were analysed by multiple immunofluorescent (IF) staining for CD8, PD-1, granzyme B (GrzB) and NFATC2. RESULTS: In total, 25 adenocarcinomas and 24 squamous cell carcinomas were analysed. All tumours showed metabolic 18F-FDG PET uptake. MMVR was correlated inversely with PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression and low MMVR were significantly correlated with clinical benefit. Necrosis was correlated negatively with MMVR. Multiplex IF staining showed a greater frequency of activated CD8+ cells in necrotic tumours than in nonnecrotic tumours in both stromal and epithelial tumour compartments. CONCLUSION: This study introduces MMVR as a new imaging biomarker and its ability to noninvasively capture increased PD-L1 tumour expression and predict clinical benefit from checkpoint blockade in NSCLC should be further evaluated.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Partially Realized Potential.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly lethal subtype of lung cancer that has seen few therapeutic advances, despite ongoing concerted efforts. Immunotherapy has been an effective option in other carcinogen-related cancers and has shown modest activity in SCLC. Monotherapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab in patients with at least two prior lines of therapy was associated with a response rate of 11.9% and a median duration of response of 17.9 months, leading to accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as third-line therapy for SCLC. Second-line checkpoint inhibitors have not performed well enough to change the standard of care, and maintenance immunotherapy has not shown significant benefit. However, the incorporation of concurrent immunotherapy in the first-line treatment of SCLC has improved outcomes. The addition of the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab to standard carboplatin plus etoposide led to an improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival, the first such improvement in over 30 years leading to the approval of atezolizumab as part of first-line therapy for advanced SCLC.

Currently, their clinical utility in NSCLC is compromised by a low detection rate with the established, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, EpCAM-based CellSearch® System. We tested an epitope-independent method (ParsortixTM system) and utilized it to assess PD-L1 expression of CTCs from NSCLC patients. We prospectively collected 127 samples, 97 of which were analyzed with the epitope-independent system in comparison to the CellSearch system. CTCs were determined by immunocytochemistry as intact, nucleated, CD45-, pankeratins (K)+ cells. PD-L1 status of CTCs was evaluated from 89 samples. With the epitope-independent system, ≥1 CTC per blood sample was detected in 59 samples (61%) compared to 31 samples (32%) with the EpCAM-based system. Upon PD-L1 staining, 47% of patients harbored only PD-L1+CTCs, 47% had PD-L1+ and PD-L1-CTCs, and only 7% displayed exclusively PD-L1-CTCs. The percentage of PD-L1+CTCs did not correlate with the percentage of PD-L1+ in biopsies determined by immunohistochemistry (p = 0.179). Upon disease progression, all patients showed an increase in PD-L1+CTCs, while no change or a decrease in PD-L1+CTCs was observed in responding patients (n = 11; p = 0.001). Our data show a considerable heterogeneity in the PD-L1 status of CTCs from NSCLC patients. An increase of PD-L1+CTCs holds potential to predict resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.",PD-L1,3

Nivolumab is an anti-programmed death 1 protein (PD-1) antibody designed to augment an immunologic reaction against cancer cells. On the contrary, CPIs are known to cause a unique variety of side effects termed as immune-related adverse events, which can affect any organ including kidney. However, the characteristics of renal disorders by nivolumab treatment are poorly described. We describe two cases of acute kidney injury that were treated with nivolumab. Two patients, one with renal-cell carcinoma and the other with lung cancer, exhibited progressive renal dysfunction after the initiation of nivolumab treatment. By kidney biopsy, each case was diagnosed as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Of note, tubular epithelial cells enlarged with hyperchromatic nuclei were focally observed, and this finding was consistent with karyomegalic tubular epithelial cells. In immunostaining, most of the enlarged tubular epithelial cells were positive for Ki-67, which suggested regeneration of tubular epithelial cells. Clinically, in one case, renal function was partially recovered with the discontinuation of nivolumab, while in another case renal function was fully recovered with additional corticosteroid treatment. We presented nivolumab-induced AIN with karyomegalic changes of tubular epithelia. We propose that immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary for the full recovery from renal impairment.",PD-L1,3

Inhibition of MAPK pathway may have pleiotropic effects on the microenvironment. This work investigates the efficacy of combining MEK and PD-L1 inhibition in pre-clinical and ex-vivo NSCLC models. METHODS: We studied the effects of MEK inhibitors (MEK-I) on PD-L1 and MCH-I protein expression and cytokine production in vitro in NSCLC cell lines and in PBMCs from healthy donors and NSCLC patients, the efficacy of combining MEK-I with anti-PD-L1 antibody in ex-vivo human spheroid cultures obtained from fresh biopsies from NSCLC patients in terms of cell growth arrest, cytokine production and T-cell activation by flow cytometry. RESULTS: MEK-I modulates in-vitro the immune micro-environment through a transcriptionally decrease of PD-L1 expression, enhance of MHC-I expression on tumor cells, increase of the production of several cytokines, like IFNγ, IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα. These effects trigger a more permissive anti-tumor immune reaction, recruiting immune cells to the tumor sites. We confirmed these data on ex-vivo human spheroids, showing a synergism of MEK and PD-L1 inhibition as result of both direct cancer cell toxicity of MEK-I and its immune-stimulatory effect on cytokine secretion profile of cancer cells and PBMCs with the induction of the ones that sustain an immune-reactive and inflammatory micro-environment. CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows the biological rationale for combining immunotherapy with MEK-I in a reproducible ex-vivo 3D-culture model, useful to predict sensitivity of patients to such therapies.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Improved prognosis and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in small cell lung cancer patients with neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) develop a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS). Neurologic PNS are thought to improve prognosis, which we hypothesized is related to increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and immune recognition. METHODS: We queried 2,512,042 medical records from a single institution to identify SCLC patients with and without PNS and performed manual, retrospective chart review. We then performed multiplexed fluorescence immunohistochemistry and automated quantitative analysis (AQUA® Technology) on tumors to assess CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell infiltrates and PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. T cell infiltrates and PD-1/PD-L1 interaction scores were compared among patients with neurologic PNS, endocrinologic PNS, and a control group without PNS. Clinical outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: We evaluated 145 SCLC patients: 55 with PNS (25 neurologic and 30 endocrinologic) and 90 controls. Patients with neurologic PNS experienced improved overall survival (OS) compared to patients with endocrinologic PNS and controls (median OS 24mo vs. 12mo vs. 13mo, respectively). Of the 145 patients, we identified tumor tissue from 34 patients that was adequate for AQUA analysis. Among 37 specimens from these 34 patients, patients with neurologic PNS had increased T cell infiltrates (p=0.033) and PD-1/PD-L1 interaction (p=0.014) compared to tumors from patients with endocrinologic PNS or controls. CONCLUSION: Tumor tissue from patients with SCLC with neurologic PNS demonstrated increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-1/PD-L1 interaction consistent with an inflamed tumor microenvironment.",PD-L1,3

Patients and methods: Peripheral blood was obtained from 37 chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic NSCLC before treatment. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression was evaluated (1) on ICs with anti-tumor function (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, monocytes/dendritic cells) using flow cytometry, (2) on CTCs by immunofluorescence and (3) on cells from tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. The levels of PD-1+ and PD-L1+-expressing ICs were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS). Results: The presence of PD-1+ CD8+ cells, with reduced interferon (IFN)-γ expression, but not other ICs, were positively correlated with PD-L1+ CTCs (p < 0.04). Increased percentages of PD-1+ CD8+ T-cells, were associated with a worse response to treatment (p = 0.032) and shorter PFS (p = 0.023) which, in multivariate analysis, was revealed as an independent predictor for decreased PFS [hazard ratio (HR): 4.1, p = 0.0007]. Conclusion: The results of the current study, for first time, provide evidence for a possible interaction between ICs and CTCs in NSCLC patients via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and strongly support that the levels of PD-1+ CD8+ in these patients may be of clinical relevance.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],An Improved Patient-Derived Xenograft Humanized Mouse Model for Evaluation of Lung Cancer Immune Responses.,"Human tumor xenograft models do not replicate the human immune system and tumor microenvironment. We developed an improved humanized mouse model, derived from fresh cord blood CD34+ stem cells (CD34+ HSC), and combined it with lung cancer cell line-derived human xenografts or patient-derived xenografts (Hu-PDX). Fresh CD34+ HSCs could reconstitute detectable mature human leukocytes (hCD45+) in mice at four weeks without the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Repopulated human T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DC), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) increased in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow over time. Although cultured CD34+ HSCs labeled with luciferase could be detected in mice, the cultured HSCs did not develop into mature human immune cells by four weeks, unlike fresh CD34+ HSCs. Ex vivo, reconstituted T cells, obtained from the tumor-bearing humanized mice, secreted IFNγ upon treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or exposure to human A549 lung tumor cells and mediated antigen-specific CTL responses, indicating functional activity. Growth of engrafted PDXs and tumor xenografts was not dependent on the human leukocyte antigen status of the donor. Treatment with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or nivolumab inhibited tumor growth in humanized mice significantly, and correlated with an increased number of CTLs and decreased MDSCs, regardless of the donor HLA type. In conclusion, fresh CD34+HSCs are more effective than their expanded counterparts in humanizing mice, and do so in a shorter time. The Hu-PDX model provides an improved platform for evaluation of immunotherapy.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Autoimmune diabetes is a rare but life-threatening endocrine adverse event, which has been reported in patients treated with anti-programmed-cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) and anti-programmed-cell death-1 ligand (anti-PD-L1) therapies. Case description: We report a 52-year-old woman with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at 24 weeks after atezolizumab initiation. She initially received oral antidiabetic medication from primary care hospital and experienced recurrent DKA 3 days later. Her plasma glucose on the day that she had recurrent DKA was 332 mg/dL (18.4 mmol/L), A1c was 7.9% (63 mmol/mol), fasting C-peptide was <0.03 nmol/L (0.1 ng/ml), fasting insulin level was <1 μIU/ml, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA) was 7.2 U/ml (normal, >5 U/ml), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II typing was DR3-DQ2/DR14-DQ5. A diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes was made. After treatment for DKA, she recovered and received basal-bolus insulin treatment. Atezolizumab had been discontinued after the fifth cycle, prior to the development of DKA, due to progression of lung cancer. Conclusion: To date, there has been neither an effective way to detect if a patient is at high risk for autoimmune diabetes nor to prevent the complications associated with it. Regular glucose monitoring is the best method of early diabetes detection. In patients with new onset diabetes following treatment with ICIs, C-peptide levels and GADA should be screened, and insulin therapy should be prescribed to prevent hyperglycemic emergency while waiting for definite diagnosis.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Nivolumab-induced Thyroid Dysfunctions in Patients with Previously Treated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed cell death-1 checkpoint inhibitor, demonstrated its benefit of prolonged survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, nivolumab generated unique immune-related adverse events such as thyroid dysfunctions. Herein we assessed nivolumab-induced thyroid dysfunctions in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC in our hospital. METHODS: The medical records of 11 patients with advanced NSCLC who were initiated with nivolumab treatment between June 28, 2018, and January 15, 2019, in our hospital were reviewed. Serological tests of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free tetraiodothyronine were measured at baseline and every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Three out of 11 patients developed new-onset hypothyroidism during the treatment, and two of three patients had transient hyperthyroidism first. Two patients were diagnosed with Grade 2 hypothyroidism and received levothyroxine therapy. The other one was Grade 1 hypothyroidism and asymptomatic. All these three patients continued nivolumab therapy. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab-induced thyroid dysfunctions in advanced NSCLC were mostly mild and controlled. Thyroid function needs to be monitored for early prediction and appropriate managements of thyroid dysfunctions.",PD-L1,3

With the increasing use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone or in combination with other therapies, awareness and management of irAEs have become more important. We aimed to assess the incidence and nature of irAEs associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors for NSCLC. METHODS: Articles from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched through December 2017. The incidence of overall and organ-specific irAEs was investigated in all clinical trials with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolimumab, durvalumab, and avelumab as single agents for treatment of NSCLC. We calculated the pooled incidence using R software with package Meta. RESULTS: Sixteen trials were included in the meta-analysis: 10 trials with PD-1 inhibitors (3734 patients) and 6 trials with PD-L1 inhibitors (2474 patients). The overall incidence of irAEs was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17-28) for all grades and 4% (95% CI, 2-6) for high-grade irAEs. The frequency of irAEs varied based on drug type and organ, and patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors had an increased rate of any grade and high-grade irAEs compared with patients who received PD-L1 inhibitors. Organ-specific irAEs were most frequently observed in, in decreasing order, the endocrine system, skin, pulmonary tract, and gastrointestinal tract. The total number of patients whose death was attributed to irAEs was 14 (0.34%), and most (79%) of these patients died because of pneumonitis. The median time to the onset of irAEs after the initiation of treatment was 10 weeks (interquartile range, 6-19.5 weeks) and varied depending on the organ system involved. CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of irAEs was closely associated with the mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies involved in restarting anticancer immune attacks. Comprehensive understanding, timely detection, and effective management could improve the compliance of patients and guide the interruption of treatment.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Severe pulmonary infections complicating nivolumab treatment for lung cancer: a report of two cases.,"Background: Immunotherapy represents a recent milestone in the treatment of lung cancer, particularly with the rapidly expanding development of monoclonal antibodies targeting checkpoint inhibitors in the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Classical auto-immune side effects of these treatments, often called immune-related adverse events (irAEs), can affect multiple organs, including the lungs in which potentially life-threatening pneumonitis may require rapid treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. Nevertheless, the occurrence of severe infections in cancer patients treated with nivolumab, outside the context of immunosuppressive therapy, is a complication that has rarely been reported in the literature. Clinical cases: We report two cases of severe pulmonary infection with unusual microbes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Aspergillus fumigatus, in patients treated with nivolumab for non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusion: Ruling out pulmonary infections may require extensive investigation, as these may have an atypical presentation due to immunomodulation. Furthermore, treating the patient with corticosteroids for immune-related pneumonia could lead to a fatal outcome in this context. This report highlights the importance of excluding the presence of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis before considering immune-related pulmonary toxicity with or without a history of prior corticosteroid use. These cases also emphasize the potential value of tuberculosis screening in patients treated with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.",PD-L1,3

However, there are currently no prospective studies evaluating PD-L1 expression for small biopsy samples. METHODS: To prospectively investigate the reliability of small samples for NSCLC, we included patients who underwent diagnostic biopsy by flexible bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT) and ultra-sonography (US) guided core-needle to determine the PD-L1 expression status. In pathologically confirmed NSCLC, PD-L1 expression was evaluated using companion diagnostic PD-L1 immunohistochemistry. We evaluated: 1) tumor cell count and sample size, 2) tumor proportion score (TPS): <1, 1-49%, 50%≦, and 3) the concordance rate of TPS by biopsy and surgical samples. RESULTS: Of the 153 cases of PD-L1 expression, 110 were assessed using endobronchial ultrasonography guided transbronchial biopsy (EBUS-TBB) (thin bronchoscopy 84 cases; normal bronchoscopy 26 cases), 23 were endobronchial ultrasonography guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), and 20 cases of CT or US-guided core-needle biopsy. Tumor cell count and sample size were significantly larger for normal bronchoscopy than thin bronchoscopy or EBUS-TBNA samples. Moreover, tumor cell counts for each subsequent biopsy decreased. In all cases, TPS distribution (undiagnosed, <1%, 1-49, 50%≦) was 2.6, 34.6, 31.4, 31.4%, respectively. TPS positive cases using thin bronchoscope was 55.9%, normal bronchoscope was 73.1% and EBUS-TBNA was 78.3%. In early stage adenocarcinoma, TPS was lower compared with advanced stages. Conversely, in squamous cell carcinoma, the rates of TPS were similar regardless of stage. The concordance rate of TPS by biopsy and surgical materials was 86.7%. CONCLUSION: Utilizing smaller samples for evaluation, the frequency of TPS was comparable to past clinical trials using larger samples. The differences in TPS were influenced by diagnostic tools, cancer histologic types and staging. The concordance of TPS between EBUS-TBB samples and surgical materials was high.

[Epub ahead of print],Functional systemic CD4 immunity is required for clinical responses to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy.,"The majority of lung cancer patients progressing from conventional therapies are refractory to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade monotherapy. Here, we show that baseline systemic CD4 immunity is a differential factor for clinical responses. Patients with functional systemic CD4 T cells included all objective responders and could be identified before the start of therapy by having a high proportion of memory CD4 T cells. In these patients, CD4 T cells possessed significant proliferative capacities, low co-expression of PD-1/LAG-3 and were responsive to PD-1 blockade ex vivo and in vivo In contrast, patients with dysfunctional systemic CD4 immunity did not respond even though they had lung cancer-specific T cells. Although proficient in cytokine production, CD4 T cells in these patients proliferated very poorly, strongly co-upregulated PD-1/LAG-3, and were largely refractory to PD-1 monoblockade. CD8 immunity only recovered in patients with functional CD4 immunity. T-cell proliferative dysfunctionality could be reverted by PD-1/LAG-3 co-blockade. Patients with functional CD4 immunity and PD-L1 tumor positivity exhibited response rates of 70%, highlighting the contribution of CD4 immunity for efficacious PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: We report the first case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) in a patient treated with an anti-Programmed Death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Results: After a single dose of this drug the patient showed severe myositis associated with a high anti-PR3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titer. Discontinuation of the anti-PD-1 and introduction of corticoids led to a remission of the irAE. Regarding tumor a partial response was noted. A year later a neutrophilic, sterile pleural exudate and cutaneous lesions appeared with the pathological findings of neutrophilic vasculitis. Retreatment with corticoids induced a new remission of symptoms. It remains unclear whether GPA was preexisting and clinically silent but revealed by the use of ICI or primarily induced by this treatment.

Little evidence exists on the safety of resuming these treatments after an irAE. Objective: To investigate the safety of a rechallenge with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies after an irAE. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of the safety of an ICI rechallenge involved consecutive adult patients (n = 93) who were referred to the ImmunoTOX assessment board at the Gustave Roussy cancer center in Villejuif, France, between August 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from May 28 to November 25, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of a second irAE in patients who had a readministration of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 inhibitor after an initial grade 2 or higher irAE. Characteristics of the patients and the irAEs were reviewed, and the primary end point was the rate of occurrence of second irAEs. Results: A total of 93 patients were included, among whom 48 (52%) were female, and the median (range) age was 62.5 (33-85) years. The main cancer types or tumor sites were melanoma (31 [33%]), lung (15 [16%]), colorectal (8 [9%]), and lymphoma (8 [9%]). For the initial irAE, 43 grade 2 events (46%), 36 grade 3 events (39%), and 14 grade 4 events (15%) were found, presenting primarily as hepatitis (17 [18%]), skin toxic effect (14 [15%]), pneumonitis (13 [14%]), colitis (11 [12%]), or arthralgia (7 [7.5%]). Forty patients (43%) were rechallenged with the same anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent. The rechallenged and non-rechallenged groups did not differ in terms of median (range) age (61 [34-84] years vs 63 [33-85] years; P = .37), time to initial irAE (5 [1-40] treatment cycles vs 3 [1-22] treatment cycles; P = .32), irAE severity (grade 2: 18 [47.5%] vs 27 [51%]; grades 3-4: 22 [52.5%] vs 26 [49%]; P = .70), or steroid use (17 [42.5%] vs 32 [60%]; P = .09). With a median follow-up period of 14 months, the same irAE or a different irAE occurred in 22 patients (55%). Shorter time to the initial irAE was linked to the occurrence of a second irAE (9 vs 15 weeks; P = .04). The second irAEs were not found to be more severe than the first. Conclusions and Relevance: The risk-reward ratio for an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 rechallenge appears to be acceptable, although these patients require close monitoring; further investigation into rechallenge conditions through a prospective clinical trial is needed.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Effect of sex on the efficacy of patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promising efficacy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sex-associated dimorphism in immune system response is acknowledged, but the effect of patients sex on efficacy of ICIs as treatment in NSCLC still remains controversial. The present study was conducted to investigate the difference in efficacy of NSCLC patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors according to the sex. A total of 9583 patients involved 6567 men and 3016 women with advanced lung cancer from 15 randomized controlled trials were included in this study. An overall survival (OS) benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors was illustrated in both male (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71-0.82) and female (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.91) patients, and a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was also found in both men (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.77) and women (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.95) in NSCLC. Both PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone and PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy significantly improved the OS and PFS in male patients. Whereas in females, PD-1 inhibitors or monotherapy significantly benefited the OS but not the PFS, PD-L1 inhibitors or combination therapy significantly prolonged the PFS but not the OS. No survival benefit was found in both male and female patients from the CTLA-4 inhibitors. The current study indicated that the magnitude of survival benefit is sex-dependent and male patients seemed to obtain more consistent and favorable outcomes from ICIs than women patients in NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

The direct interactions between inhibitory NK cell receptors and their HLA-I ligands enable NK cells to distinguish healthy from transformed cells, which frequently show an altered expression of HLA-I molecules. Indeed, NK cells can kill cancer cells that have lost, or under express, HLA-I molecules, but not cells maintaining their expression. In this last case, it is possible to use anti-KIR or anti-NKG2A monoclonal antibodies to block the inhibitory signals generated by these receptors and to restore the anti-tumor NK cell activity.

This treatment provided only modest survival benefit. The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) signaling pathway in the treatment of patients with NSCLC has had significant effect on patient survival. Atezolizumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been shown to be superior to chemotherapy in patients with recurrent NSCLC. Recently, pembrolizumab has been combined with chemotherapy in the front-line setting and has demonstrated an improvement in overall survival in NSCLC patients as compared to chemotherapy alone. In this review we will focus on the clinical trials that led to approval of combination pembrolizumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC as well as discuss other combinations of immunotherapy and chemotherapy that have also been evaluated.",PD-L1,3

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) induce various immune-related adverse events. Life-threatening hematotoxicity can be provoked by ICI therapy. Although ICI-related endocrinopathy and interstitial lung disease have been well documented, hematotoxicity requiring intensive treatment is relatively rare. We describe a case of nivolumab induced thrombocytopenia after transient mild fever. A 77-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer was administered nivolumab (240 mg/body, every 2 weeks) as second line therapy. On the day 2 after the first nivolumab infusion, he had a fever and his C-reactive protein level was elevated. Thoracic computed tomography revealed no interstitial lung disease or pneumonia. The fever resolved on day 9 and was not seen thereafter. On day 15 after the first nivolumab infusion, severe thrombocytopenia suddenly emerged. A bone marrow examination revealed no dysplasia or invasion. Based on the presence of high platelet-associated IgG titer, normal bone marrow plasticity and a lack of effectiveness of platelet infusion, we diagnosed nivolumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia. Daily administration of 60 mg of prednisolone restored the patients platelet count and platelet-associated IgG. We also found that there was significant shrinkage of the primary lesion and that stable disease was achieved. One must be aware of this relatively rare side effect and the unusual clinical findings that could be associated with immunoreaction.",PD-L1,3

Cancer Commun (Lond). 2019 Jun 3;39(1):30. doi: 10.1186/s40880-019-0376-6.,PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression correlated genes in non-small-cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and ligand-2 (PD-L2) interaction with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) represent an immune-inhibiting checkpoint mediating immune evasion and is, accordingly, an important target for blockade-based immunotherapy in cancer. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), improved understanding of PD-1 checkpoint blockade-responsive biology and identification of biomarkers for prediction of a clinical response to immunotherapy is warranted. Thus, in the present study, we systematically described PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression correlated genes in NSCLC. METHODS: We performed comparative retrospective analyses to identify PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression correlated genes in NSCLC. For this, we examined available datasets from the cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE) project lung non-small-cell (Lung_NSC) and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) projects lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). RESULTS: Analysis of the CCLE dataset Lung_NSC identified expression correlation between PD-L1 and PD-L2. Moreover, we identified expression correlation between 489 genes and PD-L1, 191 genes and PD-L2, and 111 genes for both. PD-L1 and PD-L2 also expression correlated in TCGA datasets LUAD and LUSC. In LUAD, we identified expression correlation between 257 genes and PD-L1, 914 genes and PD-L2, and 211 genes for both. In LUSC, we identified expression correlation between 26 genes and PD-L1, 326 genes and PD-L2, and 13 genes for both. Only a few genes expression correlated with PD-L1 and PD-L2 across the CCLE and TCGA datasets. Expression of Interferon signaling-involved genes converged in particular with the expression correlated genes for PD-L1 in Lung_NSC, for PD-L2 in LUSC, and for both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in LUAD. In LUSC, PD-L1, and to a lesser extent PD-L2, expression correlated with chromosome 9p24 localized genes, indicating a chromosome 9p24 topologically associated domain as an important driver of in particular LUSC PD-L1 expression. Expression correlation analyses of the PD-L1 and PD-L2 receptors programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), Cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80), and Repulsive guidance molecule B (RGMB) showed that PD-1 and CD80 expression correlated with both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in LUAD. CD80 expression correlated with PD-L2 in LUSC. CONCLUSIONS: We present gene signatures associated with PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression in NSCLC which could possess importance in relation to understand PD-1 checkpoint blockade-responsive biology and development of gene signature based biomarkers for predicting clinical responses to immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],"Effect of platinum‑based chemotherapy on the expression of natural killer group 2 member D ligands, programmed cell death‑1 ligand 1 and HLA class I in non‑small cell lung cancer.","Platinum‑based chemotherapy improves the clinical outcome of patients with non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although tumors often become refractory after treatment. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to investigate the expression levels of natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands, programmed cell death‑1 ligand 1 (PD‑L1), and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)‑class I in tissue samples collected from 10 NSCLC patients who received platinum‑based chemotherapy followed by surgery. Additionally, the effects of repeated exposure to cisplatin on the expression of NKG2D ligands, PD‑L1 and HLA‑class I in NSCLC cell lines were assessed by flow cytometry. We found upregulation of PD‑L1 or downregulation of NKG2D ligands in 5 of the 10 NSCLC cases, leading to the attenuation of NK cell‑mediated tumor cell death. Moreover, upregulation of PD‑L1 or downregulation of HLA‑class I were observed in 6 cases, supporting tumor escape from T cell immunity. An in vitro assay showed that repeated exposure to cisplatin enhanced the expression of PD‑L1 and NKG2D ligands in NSCLC cell lines. Notably, interferon gamma (IFNγ) stimuli enhanced PD‑L1 expression while attenuated that of NKG2D ligands in NSCLC cell lines, which mimicked the results of the clinical study. Both IFNγ‑induced upregulation of PD‑L1 and downregulation of NKG2D ligands were blocked by the JAK‑STAT inhibitor tofacitinib. These findings suggested that the expression levels of NKG2D ligands, PD‑L1 and HLA‑class I in residual tumors after chemotherapy were affected by host immunity, resulting in an immunoescape phenotype. Blocking IFNγ‑induced tumor immunoescape by a JAK‑STAT inhibitor might be a promising treatment strategy for NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Assessment of the Safety of Pembrolizumab in Patients With HIV and Advanced Cancer-A Phase 1 Study.,"Importance: Anti-PD-1 (anti-programmed cell death 1) and anti-PD-L1 (anti-programmed cell death ligand 1) regimens are preferred therapies for many cancers, including cancers associated with HIV. However, patients with HIV were excluded from most registered trials. Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in people with HIV and advanced cancer; the secondary objective was to evaluate tumor responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, nonrandomized, phase 1 multicenter study conducted at 7 Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network sites. Patients with HIV and advanced cancer as well as a CD4 count greater than or equal to 100 cells/μL, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 4 or more weeks, and an HIV viral load of less than 200 copies/mL were eligible. Exclusion criteria included uncontrolled hepatitis B or C infection, active immunosuppressive therapy, or a history of autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy. Interventions: Pembrolizumab, 200 mg, administered intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 doses in 3 CD4 count-defined cohorts. Participants continued ART. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety and tolerability were assessed using current NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Immune-related adverse events grade 2 or higher were considered immune-related events of clinical interest (irECI). Tumor responses were evaluated using standard tumor-specific criteria. Results: Thirty participants (28 men and 2 women; median [range] age, 57 [39-77] years) were enrolled from April 2016 through March 2018; 6 had Kaposi sarcoma (KS), 5 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 19 had non-AIDS-defining cancers. Safety was observed over 183 cycles of treatment with pembrolizumab. Most treatment-emergent adverse events at least possibly attributed to pembrolizumab were grade 1 or 2 (n = 22), and 20% (n = 6) were grade 3. The irECI included hypothyroidism (6 participants), pneumonitis (3 participants), rash (2 participants), an elevated aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase level (1 participant), and a musculoskeletal event (1 participant). One participant with pretreatment KS herpesvirus (KSHV) viremia developed a polyclonal KSHV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation and died. HIV was controlled in all participants. Increases in CD4 count were not statistically significant (median increase, 19 cells/μL; P = .18). Best tumor responses included complete response (lung, 1 patient), partial response (NHL, 2 patients), stable disease for 24 weeks or more (KS, 2 patients), stable disease for less than 24 weeks (15 patients), and progressive disease (8 patients); 2 patients were not evaluable. Conclusions and Relevance: Pembrolizumab has acceptable safety in patients with cancer, HIV treated with ART, and a CD4+ T-cell count of greater than 100 cells/μL but may be associated with KSHV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation. Clinical benefit was noted in lung cancer, NHL, and KS. Anti-PD-1 therapy is appropriate for US Food and Drug Administration-approved indications and clinical trials in this population.

Epub 2019 May 3.,Function of Human Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Cancer progression is marked by dysfunctional tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) with high inhibitory receptor (IR) expression. Because IR blockade has led to clinical responses in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we investigated how IRs influenced CD8+ TIL function from freshly digested early-stage NSCLC tissues using a killing assay and intracellular cytokine staining after in vitro T-cell restimulation. Early-stage lung cancer TIL function was heterogeneous with only about one third of patients showing decrements in cytokine production and lytic function. TIL hypofunction did not correlate with clinical factors, coexisting immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, or CD4+ T regulatory cells), nor with PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, CD39, or CTLA-4 expression. Instead, we found that the presence of the integrin αeβ7 (CD103), characteristic of tissue-resident memory cells (TRM), was positively associated with cytokine production, whereas expression of the transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) was negatively associated with TIL function. These data suggest that the functionality of CD8+ TILs from early-stage NSCLCs may be influenced by competition between an antitumor CD103+ TRM program and an exhaustion program marked by Eomes expression. Understanding the mechanisms of T-cell function in the progression of lung cancer may have clinical implications for immunotherapy.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

We previously reported that FXR expression promotes tumor cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we study the relevance of FXR to the immune microenvironment of NSCLC. We found an inverse correlation between FXR and PD-L1 expression in a cohort of 408 NSCLC specimens; from this, we identified a subgroup of FXRhighPD-L1low patients. We showed that FXR downregulates PD-L1 via transrepression and other mechanisms in NSCLC. Cocultured with FXRhighPD-L1low NSCLC cell lines, effector function and proliferation of CD8+ T cell in vitro are repressed. We also detected downregulation of PD-L1 in FXR-overexpressing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) mouse syngeneic models, indicating an FXRhighPD-L1low subtype in which FXR suppresses tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Anti-PD-1 therapy was effective against FXRhighPD-L1low mouse LLC tumors. Altogether, our findings demonstrate an immunosuppressive role for FXR in the FXRhighPD-L1low NSCLC subtype and provide translational insights into therapeutic response in PD-L1low NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1. We recommend FXRhighPD-L1low as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 May 4.,Immunotherapy of colorectal cancer: Challenges for therapeutic efficacy.,"A better knowledge of the complex interactions between cancer cells and the immune system has led to novel immunotherapy approaches. Treatment with selective anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been a revolution in the therapeutic scenario of several cancer types, with the highest clinical efficacy in melanoma and in lung cancer. Colorectal cancer is one of the tumours in which immunotherapy has been shown less effective. Whereas in deficient mismatch repair (MMR) or in highly microsatellite instable (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer there is clear clinical evidence for a therapeutic role of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the vast majority of patients with proficient MMR or with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours do not benefit from immunotherapy. Defining the molecular mechanisms for immunogenicity in metastatic colorectal cancer is needed in order to develop predictive biomarkers and effective therapeutic combination strategies. A major challenge will be to identify, among the heterogeneous spectrum of this disease, those patients with specific tumour and tumour infiltrating stroma molecular and functional characteristics, that could be effectively treated with immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the role of immune response in the context of metastatic colorectal cancer. We summarize the available clinical data with the use of anti PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs as single agents or in combination with anti CTLA-4 mAbs in MSI-H patients. Finally, we address the challenges and the potential strategies for rendering the more frequent microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours immune-competent and, therefore, amenable for effective immunotherapy interventions.",PD-L1,3

The treatment landscape for advanced-stage, unresectable or metastatic UC has shifted dramatically over a short period of time, with 6 new therapeutic agents available for clinical use. The use of traditional chemotherapy and new immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) directed at programmed cell-death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand has led to unprecedented survival benefits in selected patients with metastatic UC. Data show that anti-PD-1 ICIs are not only improving long-term clinical benefit, but also quality of life for patients in the second-line setting. In the front-line setting, regulatory agencies have restricted the indications of atezolizumab and pembrolizumab (both ICIs) to patients with PD-L1positivity with advanced UC and who are platinum-ineligible. Very recently, erdafitinib, a pan-FGFR inhibitor, has been granted accelerated approval by FDA for platinum-pretreated advanced metastatic UC with susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations. Enfortumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate, have been granted breakthrough designation by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic UC.

Immunotherapy agents including the anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand-1 inhibitor therapies have unique symptomatic side effects and patient-reported outcome data can help to characterize the benefits and burdens associated with therapy. METHODS: We reviewed registration trials in the Food and Drug Administration database for five anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand-1 inhibitor therapies to characterize trial design and patient-reported outcome assessment strategy (cutoff 31 December 2017). We evaluated the patient-reported outcome measurement coverage of eight key symptoms related to adverse events reported in immunotherapy agent product labels (fatigue, diarrhea, cough, shortness of breath, musculoskeletal pain, rash, pruritus, and fever). RESULTS: There were a total of 28 trials across seven disease types and one tumor agnostic indication reviewed, of which 17 were randomized and 25 were open label. Of the 28 trials, 21 contained patient-reported outcome measures and all 21 used >1 instrument. The most common instruments were the EuroQol five dimension (N = 19), and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (N = 17). Disease-specific patient-reported outcome tools were included in nine trials (six lung, one head and neck, one melanoma and one renal cell). No trial used a patient-reported outcome strategy assessing all eight selected adverse events. CONCLUSION: Collection of patient-reported outcome data in anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand-1 inhibitor trials were variable and did not consistently assess important symptomatic adverse events. Use of a patient-reported outcome instrument with well-defined functional scales supplemented by item libraries to incorporate relevant symptomatic adverse events may allow for improved understanding of the patient experience while receiving therapy.

Unfortunately, many tumors will acquire resistance and >75% of NSCLC cases lack for an actionable gene aberration. In this setting, immunotherapy rises as effective therapeutic where immune checkpoint inhibitors have entered or are entering the market in many neoplasms, including NSCLC. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA-4, promoting T-cell activation and its subsequent anti-tumoral immune effect. Ipilimumab might have a very important role in NSCLC as it does in melanoma because of its synergistic effect with PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors. Areas covered: We summarize current results of clinical studies of ipilimumab for efficacy and safety in NSCLC and also the current knowledge about potential biomarkers for its efficacy. Expert Opinion: Combined use of PD-1/PDL-1 and anti-CTL4 inhibitors increases the efficacy against NSCLC and it is a very promising approach not only in NSCLC but also in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for first or second-line therapy.

METHODS: We studied 19 Japanese patients with PD-1 myopathy (13 men and 6 women, mean age 70 years), who were referred to Keio University. As control groups, we used 68 patients with anti-signal recognition particle antibodies, 51 patients with anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase antibodies and 460 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In regard to muscle-disease severity, 10 patients showed a mild form of disease and 9 patients showed a severe form. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common underlying cancer. PD-1 inhibitor consisted of 11 nivolumab and 8 pembrolizumab. PD-1 myopathy occurred 29 days on average after the first administration of PD-1 inhibitor. The initial manifestation of muscle weakness was ptosis in 10 patients, 15 patients had ptosis, 13 diplopia, 8 facial muscle weakness, 10 bulbar symptoms, 13 limb weakness, 14 neck weakness, 4 cardiac involvement, 6 respiratory involvement and 16 myalgia. Ocular, facial, cardiac and respiratory involvement and myalgia were more frequently observed than controls. Serum creatine kinase was increased to 5247 IU/L on average. Autoantibodies related to inflammatory myopathy were negative, while anti-striational antibodies were found in 13 (68%) patients. HLA-C*12:02 alleles were more frequently detected than healthy controls. Muscle pathology was characterized by multifocal necrotic myofibers with endomysial inflammation and expression of MHC class I. Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids was generally effective for muscle weakness.

METHODS: We examined 155 patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea between March 2014 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, EGFR/ALK mutation status, metastatic locations, response to ICIs, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years and 72.9% of patients were male; former or current smokers constituted 67.1% of the subjects. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (67.7%), and 50.3% of the patients underwent ≥ 2 previous treatments. Twenty-three patients (14.8%) were EGFR mutation- or ALK rearrangement-positive. The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.4-31.4%]; the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.06 (95% CI 1.893-4.21) and 10.25 (95% CI 5.39-15.11) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG performance status, EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement status, liver metastasis and PD-L1 proportion as independent predictors of OS. Furthermore, 61.9% of the patients had adverse events of any grade; 38.1% had immune-related adverse events that were associated with PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world ORR, PFS, OS, and adverse event profiles were comparable to previous clinical trials despite the patients different baseline characteristics. Our findings can aid in establishing effective immunotherapeutic management of NSCLC in routine clinical practice.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Feb 27.,The Effect of LKB1 Activity on the Sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR Inhibition in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Liver kinase B1 (LKB1), also called serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11), is a tumor suppressor that functions as master regulator of cell growth, metabolism, survival, and polarity. Approximately 30% to 35% of patients with NSCLC possess inactivated liver kinase B1 gene (LKB1), and these patients respond poorly to anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy. Therefore, novel therapies targeting NSCLC with LKB1 loss are needed. METHODS: We used a new in silico signaling analysis method to identify the potential therapeutic targets and reposition drugs by integrating gene expression data with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways. LKB1 wild-type and LKB1-deficient NSCLC cell lines, including knockout clones generated by clustered regularly interspaced short pallindromic repeats-Cas9, were treated with inhibitors of mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and a dual inhibitor. RESULTS: In silico experiments showed that inhibition of both mTOR and PI3K can be synergistically effective in LKB1-deficient NSCLC. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed the synergistic effect of mTOR inhibition and PI3K inhibition in LKB1-mutant NSCLC cell lines. The sensitivity to dual inhibition of mTOR and PI3K is higher in LKB1-mutant cell lines than in wild-type cell lines. A higher compensatory increase in Akt phosphorylation after rapamycin treatment of LKB1-deficient cells than after rapamycin treatment of LKB1 wild-type cells is responsible for the synergistic effect of mTOR and PI3K inhibition. Dual inhibition of mTOR and PI3K resulted in a greater decrease in protein expression of cell cycle-regulating proteins in LKB1 knockout cells than in LKB1 wild-type cells. CONCLUSION: Dual molecular targeted therapy for mTOR and PI3K may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the specific population of patients with lung cancer with LKB1 loss.",PD-L1,3

METHODS: Trp53FloxFlox;KrasG12D/+;Rosa26LSL-Luciferase/LSL-Luciferase (PKL) genetically engineered mice were used to develop autochthonous lung tumors with intratracheal delivery of adenoviral Cre recombinase. Using these tumor-bearing lungs, tumor-infiltrating immune cells were characterized by both mass cytometry and flow cytometry. PKL-mediated immunocompetent syngeneic and transgenic lung cancer mouse models were treated with MEKi alone as well as in combination with either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAbs. Tumor growth and survival outcome were assessed. Finally, immune cell populations within spleens and tumors were evaluated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were significantly augmented in PKL-driven lung tumors compared to normal lungs of tumor-free mice. PD-L1 expression appeared to be highly positive in both lung tumor cells and, particularly MDSCs. The combinatory administration of MEKi with either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAbs synergistically increased antitumor response and survival outcome compared with single-agent therapy in both the PKL-mediated syngeneic and transgenic lung cancer models. Theses combinational treatments resulted in significant increases of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, whereas attenuation of CD11b+/Gr-1high MDSCs, in particular, Ly6Ghigh polymorphonuclear-MDSCs in the syngeneic model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic approach for untargetable Kras/p53-driven lung cancers with synergy between targeted therapy using MEKi and immunotherapies.",PD-L1,3

We hypothesized that TP53 mutations could reflect TMB and be associated with ICI benefit. METHODS: TP53 mutations were assessed by next-generation sequencing in aNSCLC patients treated with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockers. Clinical data, tumor programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, and KRAS mutational status were collected. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In total, 72 patients (median [interquartile range] age: 61 [33-83] years) were included; 52 (72%) were male; 39 (54%) had performance status 0-1; 53 (74%) had adenocarcinoma; 20 (28%) received first-line ICI, 52 (72%) second line or more. In 65 patients with available data, 36 (55%) expressed PD-L1 in ≥50% of tumor cells, 20 (31%) in 1-49% of cells, and nine (14%) were PD-L1-negative. Non-synonymous TP53 mutations were observed in 41 (57%) and 25 (35%) harbored KRAS-mutated tumors. After a median follow-up of 15.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.3-17.4 m), the median OS in the TP53-mutated group was 18.1 months (95% CI 6.6-not reached), vs. 8.1 months (95% CI 2.2-14.5, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.95, p = 0.04) in the TP53-wild-type group. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in TP53-mutated patients (4.5 months, 95% CI 2.8-18.1 versus 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; p = 0.03), although TP53 mutation status failed to significantly influence PFS in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.32). Objective response rate (ORR) was higher in patients with TP53 mutation (51.2% vs. 20.7%; p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, TP53 mutations independently associated with longer OS (HR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.77, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: TP53-mutated status correlated with immunotherapy OS benefit in aNSCLC.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Mar 22.,Predictive value of serum protein levels in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with nivolumab.,"BACKGROUND: Although programmed cell death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor tissue has been established as predictive biomarker for the anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), additional biomarkers are critically needed. We evaluated serum proteins relevant to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab to identify novel non-invasive predictive biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC, who had failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, received nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg, Q2W) until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity was observed. Blood samples were collected at baseline and week 4. Fifty-seven serum protein levels were quantified with a Milliplex MAP assay. The associations of both clinical benefit (CB) and the onset of immune related adverse events (irAEs) with serum proteins levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled in the study, with 38 and 32 paired serum samples at baseline and week 4 being available for efficacy analysis and irAE analysis, respectively. In durable CB (DCB) patients compared with non-DCB patients, the baseline serum levels of BMP-9 were significantly higher, whereas the follistatin, IL-8, IP-10, and TNF-α levels were significantly lower. In irAE patients compared with non-irAE patients the serum levels of G-CSF and RANTES at week 4 were significantly higher, whereas the levels of leptin were significantly lower. A multivariate analysis revealed that follistatin and IP-10 were statistically associated with DCB (p < 0.05) and RANTES was associated with irAE onset (p < 0.05). In a subset of irAE-developed patients, RANTES levels decreased after steroid administration, supporting its involvement in irAE. CONCLUSION: Serum proteins have the potential to be predictive markers for DCB and irAEs onset in patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab. In addition, antitumor activity and irAEs may not be regulated by the same mechanisms.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Apr 3.,MicroRNAs aid the assessment of programmed death ligand 1 expression in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.,"The qualification of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody therapy is based on an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment of PD-L1 expression. Immunological checkpoint inhibitors improve the overall survival of patients with expression of PD-L1; however certain PD-L1-negative patients may also benefit from immunotherapy. This indicates the requirement for novel predictive factors for the qualification of immunotherapy. It is also necessary to understand the mechanisms that effect the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells. The expression of PD-L1 in 47 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, NSCLC specimens was assessed using IHC and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The expression of 8 microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) complementary to PD-L1-mRNA was also evaluated using RT-qPCR. A positive correlation was revealed between the expression level of PD-L1-mRNA and 2 miRs, miR-141 (R=0.533; P=0.0029) and miR-1184 (R=0.463; P=0.049). There was also a positive correlation between the percentage of PD-L1-positive tumor cells and the expression levels of miR-141 (R=0.441; P=0.0024), miR-200b (R=0.372; P=0.011) and miR-429 (R=0.430; P=0.0028), and between the percentage of the tumor area with immune cell infiltration and the expression levels of miR-141 (R=0.333; P=0.03) and miR-200b (R=0.312; P=0.046). Additionally, the percentage of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 positively correlated with miR-141 expression (R=0.407; P=0.0055). Correlations between the expression of the investigated miRs (particularly miR-141) and PD-L1 indicated that miRs may regulate PD-L1 expression at a post-transcriptional level.",PD-L1,3

These CPIs have been identified to have an effective therapeutic response, particularly in tumors with high tumor mutation burden. Targeting private somatic mutations encoding immunogenic neoantigens (neo-Ags) has been developed as an autologous gene therapy. T-cell receptor-engineered T cells targeting neo-Ags are a novel option for adoptive cell therapy used for the treatment of lung cancer. However, not all patients experience an effective response from immunotherapy. Although the resistance mechanism of CPIs has been reported, its association with other treatment methods during systemic anticancer therapy remains unclear, particularly the treatment options following the emergence of drug resistance in lung cancer. The potential biomarkers used for liquid biopsy may assist in the identification of patients who would benefit the most from immunotherapy. Attempts to identify potential biomarkers for predicting clinical response to immunotherapy are underway. With regard to liquid biopsy, the present review summarizes and discusses the lung cancer management of immunotherapy for precision medicine by reviewing recent literature and associated clinical trials.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Mar 13.,Clinical Implications of Circulating Tumor DNA Tumor Mutational Burden (ctDNA TMB) in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a potential biomarker predicting response to anti-programmed cell death-1 protein receptor (PD-1)/programmed cell death-1 protein ligand (PD-L1) therapy, but few studies have explored using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) TMB in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 patients with NSCLC with ctDNA testing were retrospectively evaluated from a single institution, along with a validation cohort from a second institution. ctDNA TMB was derived using the number of detected mutations over the DNA sequencing length. RESULTS: Higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with smoking history (p < .05, chi-squared test). Among patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (n = 20), higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with shorter progressive free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 45 vs. 355 days; hazard ratio [HR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-24.6; p < .01, and OS 106 days vs. not reached; HR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.3-27.1; p < .01, respectively). In a small independent validation cohort (n = 12), there was a nonsignificant numerical difference for higher ctDNA TMB predicting shorter OS but not PFS. ctDNA TMB was not correlated with RECIST tumor burden estimation in the subset of patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that higher ctDNA TMB, at the current commercial sequencing length, reflects worse clinical outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Biomarkers to identify patients who will respond to immune checkpoint blockade are critical. Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a viable biomarker to predict response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, but few studies have explored the meaning and potential clinical significance of noninvasive, blood-based TMB. Here, we investigated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) TMB and present data demonstrating that current ctDNA TMB may reflect tumor burden and that ctDNA panels with a greater number of mutations may be necessary to more accurately reflect tissue TMB.© AlphaMed Press 2019.",PD-L1,3

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with advanced cancer, treated with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) agents, were evaluated according to the presence of pre-existing AIDs. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and clinical outcomes were compared among subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 751 patients were enrolled; median age was 69 years. Primary tumors were as follows: non-small cell lung cancer, 492 (65.5%); melanoma, 159 (21.2%); kidney cancer, 94 (12.5%); and others, 6 (0.8%). Male/female ratio was 499/252. Eighty-five patients (11.3%) had pre-existing AIDs, further differentiated in clinically active (17.6%) and inactive (82.4%). Among patients with pre-existing AIDs, incidence of irAEs of any grade was significantly higher when compared with patients without AIDs (65.9% vs. 39.9%). At multivariate analysis, both inactive (p = .0005) and active pre-existing AIDs (p = .0162), female sex (p = .0004), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status <2 (p = .0030) were significantly related to a higher incidence of irAEs of any grade. No significant differences were observed regarding grade 3/4 irAEs and objective response rate among subgroups. Pre-existing AIDs were not significantly related with progression-free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSION: This study quantifies the increased risk of developing irAEs in patients with pre-existing AIDs who had to be treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the incidence of grade 3/4 irAEs is not significantly higher when compared with control population. The finding of a greater incidence of irAEs among female patients ranks among the hot topics"" in gender-related differences in immuno-oncology. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Patients with a history of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) have not usually been included in clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors but are frequent in clinical practice.

Previous studies showed that CD137+ CD8+ T cells are enriched in antitumour effector T cells in both preclinical tumour models and cancer patients, but to date, such T cells in the blood of lung cancer patients have not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, circulating antigen-activated CD8+ T cell subsets, identified as CD137+ CD8+ or PD-1+ (programmed cell death protein 1) CD8+ , and regulatory T cells (Treg), identified as CD4+ CD25+ CD127low/- , in 40 untreated lung cancer patients and in 49 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were assessed by flow cytometry. Results were evaluated for associations with lung cancer patient clinical characteristics. Correlations between antigen-activated CD8+ T cells and effector Treg (CTLA-4+ [cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4] CD4+ CD25+ CD127low/- ) were also investigated. Higher percentages of PD-1+ , CD137+ and PD-1+ CD137+ amongst CD8+ T cells were observed in lung cancer patients compared with HCs. The percentages of CD137+ CD8+ and PD-1+ CD137+ CD8+ T cell subsets amongst CD8+ T cells were positively correlated with thoracic tumour burden and were strongly positively correlated with the percentage of effector Treg subset. Smoking patients harboured higher percentages of the PD-1+ CD8+ T cell subset compared with non-smoking patients. This study demonstrated that circulating antigen-activated CD8+ T cells accumulated in lung cancer patients along with increased effector Treg and thoracic tumour burden. These findings aid a better understanding of immune-host interactions in lung cancer patients using peripheral blood, and further support immunotherapeutic intervention strategies using combination therapy for differential control of Treg and activation of tumour-specific effector T cells.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology.",PD-L1,3

However, there is limited information about potential overlapping toxicity of anti-PD-1 antibodies administered after TRT. Herein, we report three cases. The first case was of a man in his 80s with squamous cell lung cancer (cT2aN0M0 stage IB). Twelve months after TRT, tumor regrowth was observed, and the patient was administered nivolumab. Twenty-four months after TRT, computed tomography (CT) showed organizing pneumonia (OP). The second case was of a man in his 70s with squamous cell lung cancer. He underwent surgery for pT3N1M0 stage IIIA; however, mediastinum lymph node metastasis developed. Therefore, he received TRT for the mediastinum lymph node metastasis. One month after the completion of TRT, nivolumab was administered. Two months after TRT, an OP diagnosis was made. The third case was of a man in his 60s with an unknown type of lung cancer. He received TRT for cT4N2M0 stage IIIB. Fourteen months after TRT, tumor regrowth was observed, thus, nivolumab was administered. Twenty-seven months after TRT, an OP diagnosis was made. These case reports draw attention to OP after TRT and anti-PD-1 antibody administration despite low V20.

Areas covered: Unfortunately, not all patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors have durable clinical responses. However, a better understanding of the complexity of interactions between the immune system and cancer, the latter capable of adopting evasion mechanisms, indicates different opportunities to enhance anti-tumor immunity.

These immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improved the overall survival of a variety of cancer such as malignant melanoma and non-small lung cancer. In addition, numerous clinical trials for additional indication of ICIs including adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapies are also currently ongoing. Therefore, more and more patients will receive ICIs in the future. However, despite the improved outcome of the cancer treatment by ICIs, the efficacy remains still limited and tumor regression have not been obtained in many cancer patients. In addition, treatment with ICIs is also associated with substantial toxicities, described as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Therefore, biomarkers to predict tumor response and occurrence of irAEs by the treatment with ICIs are required to avoid overtreatment of ICIs and minimize irAEs development. Whereas, numerous factors have been reported as potential biomarkers for tumor response to ICIs, factors for predicting irAE have been less reported. In this review, we show recent advances in the understanding of biomarkers for tumor response and occurrence of irAEs in cancer patients treated with ICIs.",PD-L1,3

Recent case studies have suggested the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and the disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system, implying that systemic immune activation may impact a balance between clotting and bleeding. However, little is known about the association of coagulation-fibrinolysis system disorder with the efficacy of ICIs. We retrospectively evaluated 83 lung cancer patients who received ICI at Kumamoto University Hospital. The association between clinical outcome and diseases associated with disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system was assessed along with tumor PD-L1 expression. Among 83 NSCLC patients, total 10 patients (12%) developed diseases associated with the disorder of coagulation-fibrinolysis system. We found that disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system occurred in patients with high PD-L1 expression and in the early period of ICI initiation. In addition, high tumor responses (72%) were observed, including two complete responses among these patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate T-cell activation strongly induces production of a primary initiator of coagulation, tissue factor in peripheral PD-L1high monocytes, in vitro.

[Epub ahead of print],"Generating Real-World Tumor Burden Endpoints from Electronic Health Record Data: Comparison of RECIST, Radiology-Anchored, and Clinician-Anchored Approaches for Abstracting Real-World Progression in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.","INTRODUCTION: Real-world evidence derived from electronic health records (EHRs) is increasingly recognized as a supplement to evidence generated from traditional clinical trials. In oncology, tumor-based Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) endpoints are standard clinical trial metrics. The best approach for collecting similar endpoints from EHRs remains unknown. We evaluated the feasibility of a RECIST-based methodology to assess EHR-derived real-world progression (rwP) and explored non-RECIST-based approaches. METHODS: In this retrospective study, cohorts were randomly selected from Flatiron Healths database of de-identified patient-level EHR data in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. A RECIST-based approach tested for feasibility (N = 26). Three non-RECIST approaches were tested for feasibility, reliability, and validity (N = 200): (1) radiology-anchored, (2) clinician-anchored, and (3) combined. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used. RESULTS: A RECIST-based approach was not feasible: cancer progression could be ascertained for 23% (6/26 patients). Radiology- and clinician-anchored approaches identified at least one rwP event for 87% (173/200 patients). rwP dates matched 90% of the time. In 72% of patients (124/173), the first clinician-anchored rwP event was accompanied by a downstream event (e.g., treatment change); the association was slightly lower for the radiology-anchored approach (67%; 121/180). Median overall survival (OS) was 17 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 14, 19]. Median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) was 5.5 months (95% CI 4.6, 6.3) and 4.9 months (95% CI 4.2, 5.6) for clinician-anchored and radiology-anchored approaches, respectively. Correlations between rwPFS and OS were similar across approaches (Spearmans rho 0.65-0.66). Abstractors preferred the clinician-anchored approach as it provided more comprehensive context. CONCLUSIONS: RECIST cannot adequately assess cancer progression in EHR-derived data because of missing data and lack of clarity in radiology reports. We found a clinician-anchored approach supported by radiology report data to be the optimal, and most practical, method for characterizing tumor-based endpoints from EHR-sourced data.

Recently, ICI has moved from the second-line to the first-line setting for many patients with non-oncogene addicted NSCLC, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The next logical step is to examine this therapy in patients with non-metastatic NSCLC to improve long-term overall survival and cure rates. For patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, ICI with durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy has brought a major improvement in 2-year progression-free and overall survival, which holds promise for an improved cure rate. As the relapse pattern in patients with completely resected early stage NSCLC is predominantly systemic, high expectations rest on the integration of ICI therapy in their treatment approach. A large number of studies with adjuvant or neo-adjuvant ICI are ongoing, and will be discussed here. The advent of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has brought a valid alternative treatment for patients unfit for or not willing to undergo surgery. Data on combining systemic therapy and SABR is virtually non-existent, but there is a strong biological rationale to combine radiotherapy and ICI therapy. Early findings in small feasibility studies are promising and now need to be explored in well-designed phase III trials.© The Author 2019.

Print 2019 Jun.,Tumor-intrinsic response to IFNγ shapes the tumor microenvironment and anti-PD-1 response in NSCLC.,"Targeting PD-1/PD-L1 is only effective in ∼20% of lung cancer patients, but determinants of this response are poorly defined. We previously observed differential responses of two murine K-Ras-mutant lung cancer cell lines to anti-PD-1 therapy: CMT167 tumors were eliminated, whereas Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumors were resistant. The goal of this study was to define mechanism(s) mediating this difference. RNA sequencing analysis of cancer cells recovered from lung tumors revealed that CMT167 cells induced an IFNγ signature that was blunted in LLC cells. Silencing Ifngr1 in CMT167 resulted in tumors resistant to IFNγ and anti-PD-1 therapy. Conversely, LLC cells had high basal expression of SOCS1, an inhibitor of IFNγ. Silencing Socs1 increased response to IFNγ in vitro and sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1. This was associated with a reshaped tumor microenvironment, characterized by enhanced T cell infiltration and enrichment of PD-L1hi myeloid cells. These studies demonstrate that targeted enhancement of tumor-intrinsic IFNγ signaling can induce a cascade of changes associated with increased therapeutic vulnerability.© 2019 Bullock et al.",PD-L1,3

Previously it was reported that platinum-based chemotherapy may change PD-L1 expression in solid cancers. However, no reports addressing alteration of PD-L1 expression after ICI therapy in NSCLC are available so far. The patients were Japanese males 83 and 87 years old, who were diagnosed with NSCLC based on the transbronchial lung biopsies showing sarcomatoid feature with high PD-L1 expression. They received Pembrolizumab, however, passed away with disease progression on day 27 and day 9, respectively. PD-L1, PD1, and CD8 antibodies were applied to pretreatment tumor biopsies and autopsy specimens. Immunoexpression of all the markers was evaluated using Aperio ImageScope. We found that PD-L1 expression decreased significantly from 75.6% to 13.2% and from 100% to 58.8%, in patients 1 and 2, respectively. This alteration was less prominent in the perinecrotic tumor area. A considerable decrease of PD-L1 score was linked with a little effect of Pembrolizumab in our patients. This association might be one of the contributing mechanisms of resistance to ICI and needs further investigation in large-scale studies.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with advanced lung cancer and oncogenic driver alterations: results from the IMMUNOTARGET registry.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-PD1/PD-L1 directed immune-checkpoint-inhibitors (ICI) are widely used to treat patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The activity of ICI across NSCLC harboring oncogenic alterations is poorly characterized. The aim of our study was to address the efficacy of ICI in the context of oncogenic addiction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study for patients receiving ICI monotherapy for advanced NSCLC with at least one oncogenic driver alteration. Anonymized data were evaluated for clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes for ICI therapy: best response (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was PFS under ICI. Secondary endpoints were best response (RECIST 1.1) and overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. RESULTS: We studied 551 patients treated in 24 centers from 10 countries. The molecular alterations involved KRAS (n = 271), EGFR (n = 125), BRAF (n = 43), MET (n = 36), HER2 (n = 29), ALK (n = 23), RET (n = 16), ROS1 (n = 7), and multiple drivers (n = 1). Median age was 60 years, gender-ratio was 1:1, never/former/current smokers were 28/51/21% respectively, and the majority of tumors were adenocarcinoma. The objective response rate by driver alteration was: KRAS=26%, BRAF=24%, ROS1=17%, MET=16%, EGFR=12%, HER2=7%, RET=6%, ALK=0%. In the entire cohort, median PFS was 2.8 months, OS 13.3 months and the best response rate 19%. In a subgroup analysis, median PFS (in months) was 2.1 for EGFR, 3.2 for KRAS, 2.5 for ALK, 3.1 for BRAF, 2.5 for HER2, 2.1 for RET, and 3.4 for MET. In certain subgroups, PFS was positively associated with PD-L1 expression (KRAS, EGFR) and with smoking status (BRAF, HER2). CONCLUSIONS: ICI induced regression in some tumors with actionable driver alterations, but clinical activity was lower compared to the KRAS group and the lack of response in the ALK group was notable. Patients with actionable tumor alterations should receive targeted therapies and chemotherapy before considering immunotherapy.© The Author 2019.

However, the mechanisms involved in PD-L1 regulation are not fully understood. To provide better insight in these mechanisms, a multiangular analysis approach was used to combine protein and mRNA expression with several clinicopathological characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Archival tissues from 640 early stage, resected NSCLC patients were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for expression of PD-L1 and CD8 infiltration. In addition, mutational status and expression of a selection of immune genes involved in the PD-L1/PD-1 axis and T-cell response was determined. RESULTS: Tumors with high PD-L1 expression on TC or on IC represent two subsets of NSCLC with minimal overlap. We observed that PD-L1 expression on IC irrespective of expression on TC is a good marker for inflammation within tumors. In the tumors with the highest IC expression and absent TC expression an association with reduced IFNγ downstream signaling in tumor cells was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that PD-L1 expression on TC and IC are both independent hallmarks of the inflamed phenotype in NSCLC, and TC-negative/IC-high tumors can also be categorized as inflamed. The lack of correlation between PD-L1 TC and IC expression in this subgroup may be caused by impaired IFNγ signaling in tumor cells. These findings may bring a better understanding of the tumor-immune system interaction and the clinical relevance of PD-L1 expression on IC irrespective of PD-L1 expression on TC.",PD-L1,3

Application of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies as checkpoint inhibitors is rapidly becoming a promising therapeutic approach in treating tumors, and some of them have successfully been commercialized in the past few years. However, not all patients show complete responses and adverse events have been noted, suggesting a better understanding of PD-1 pathway mediated immunosuppression is needed to predict patient response and improve treatment efficacy. Here, we review the progresses on the studies of the mechanistic role of PD-1 pathway in the tumor immune evasion, recent clinical development and commercialization of PD-1 pathway inhibitors, the toxicities associated with PD-1 blockade observed in clinical trials as well as how to improve therapeutic efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],New oncologic emergencies: What is there to know about inmunotherapy and its potential side effects?,"Over the last decade anticancer treatment has experienced encouraging changes. One of the latest developments is immunotherapy, which is increasingly becoming a mainstay for the treatment of these malignancies. Unlike conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy enhances anti-tumor immune response by blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints, and allowing our own immune system to fight against the tumor cells, arising as a new and innovative mechanism of action. Therefore, although well tolerated, these drugs have a unique side effect profile and are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Adverse effects of immunotherapy are most commonly observed in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung and endocrine systems. Less common toxicities may include neurological, haematological, cardiac, ocular or rheumatologic involvement. As far as we know, cancer patients are frequently seen in the Emergency Department due to treatment related toxicities, thus there is an increasing necessity to learn about this particular side effect profile given that they entail a different and unique management than that of classic chemotherapy drugs.",PD-L1,3

A new molecular approach led to a better understanding of the immune system. Checkpoint regulation, understanding the roles of Tregs, Th1, and Th2, development of Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, as well as regulation of dendritic cells and macrophages, are just a few examples of our understating that has also led to the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and modulators. This led the Nobel Prize committee in 2018, to award Dr. James P. Allison the Nobel Prize in medicine for the discovery of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, and Dr. Tasuku Honjo for the discovery of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/PD-1-ligand (PDL-1). Several ICIs are already approved by the regulatory authorities, and many more are currently used in studies of several solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Positive studies have led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency approval of a number of these compounds, but none to date are approved in breast cancer (BC). Moreover, PD-1/PDL-1, MSI high (and dMMR), and tumor mutational burden are the currently best"" predictive markers for benefit from immunotherapy. BCs have some of these markers positive only in subsets but less frequently expressed than most other solid tumors",PD-L1,3

Materials and methods: Several databases, including Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science, were searched. The main outcome measures included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs). Results: The results of meta-analysis are expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The final analysis included six trials for 3,930 patients. PD-1 inhibitors led to a statistically superior survival benefit over chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. OS was longer in patients who received PD-1 inhibitors (HR =0.71, 95% CI =0.62-0.74, P=0.000). Furthermore, PD-1 inhibitors had significantly higher objective response rate than chemotherapy (RR =0.20，95% CI =0.17-0.23, P=0.000). Meta-analysis showed that the AEs of any grade with PD-1 inhibitors were lower than those with chemotherapy (RR =0.78; 95% CI =0.75-0.81, P=0.000).

[Epub ahead of print],Tumor Characteristics Associated with Benefit from Pembrolizumab in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Purpose: Several biomarkers have been individually associated with response to PD-1 blockade, including PD-L1 and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and CD8 cells in melanoma. We sought to examine the relationship between these distinct variables with response to PD-1 blockade and long-term benefit.Experimental Design: We assessed the association between baseline tumor characteristics (TMB, PD-L1, CD4, and CD8) and clinical features and outcome in 38 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab (median follow-up of 4.5 years, range 3.8-5.5 years).Results: PD-L1 expression and CD8 infiltration correlated with each other and each significantly associated with objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). TMB was independent of PD-L1 and CD8 expression, and trended towards association with ORR and PFS. There was no association between CD4 infiltration and outcomes. Only PD-L1 expression was correlated with overall survival (OS). Among 5 patients with long-term survival >3 years with no additional systemic therapy, PD-L1 expression was the only discriminating feature. The increased predictive value for PFS and OS of composite biomarker inclusive of PD-L1, CD8, CD4, and TMB was limited.Conclusions: In patients with NSCLC treated with PD-1 blockade with long-term follow up, TMB, PD-L1, and CD8 were each associated with benefit from PD-1 blockade. Pretreatment PD-L1 expression was correlated with T lymphocyte infiltration and OS, whereas models incorporating TMB and infiltrating CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes did not substantially add to the predictive value of PD-L1 alone for OS.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Sex-based heterogeneity in response to lung cancer immunotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: We previously showed that therapy with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 agents was more effective for men as compared with women. However, since the sex-dimorphism of the immune system is complex, involving multiple elements of immune-responses, it is possible that women could derive larger benefit than men from strategies other than therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) alone. Here we investigated whether women could derive larger benefit than men from the combination of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. METHODS: We performed two meta-analyses. First, including all RCTs testing anti-PD1/ anti-PD-L1 plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, to assess different efficacy between men and women. Second, including all RCTs of first-line systemic treatment in advanced NSCLC testing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 given either alone or combined with chemotherapy to assess different efficacy of these two immunotherapeutic strategies according to patients sex. For each RCT included in the two meta-analyses, firstly, a trial-specific ratio of HRs was calculated from the ratio of the reported HRs in males and in females; secondly, these trial-specific ratios of HRs were combined across trials using a random-effects model to obtain a pooled HRs ratio. A pooled HRs ratio estimate lower than 1 indicates a greater treatment effect in men, and higher than 1 a greater effect in women. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included in the first meta-analysis. The pooled OS-HR comparing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy was 0.76 (95%CI, 0.66-0.87) for men and 0.48 (95%CI, 0.35-0.67) for women. The pooled-ratio of the OS-HRs reported in men versus women was 1.56 (95%CI, 1.21-2.01), indicating a statistically significant greater effect for women. Six RCTs were included in the second meta-analysis: 3 tested an anti-PD-1 alone, while three RCTs tested anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy. The pooled OS-HRs were 0.78 (95%CI, 0.60-1.00) in men and 0.97 (95%CI, 0.79-1.19) in women for anti-PD-1 alone, compared with 0.76 (95%CI, 0.64-0.91) in men and 0.44 (95%CI, 0.25-0.76) in women for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy. The pooled-ratio of OS-HRs, was 0.83 (95%CI, 0.65-1.06) for anti-PD-1 alone, indicating a greater effect in men, and 1.70 (95%CI, 1.16-2.49) for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy, indicating a greater effect in women. CONCLUSION: Women with advanced lung cancer derived statistically significantly larger benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to anti-PD1/PD-L1 as compared with men. © The Author(s) 2019.

Comparison of several current available antibody clones and antibody profiling.,"PD-L1 is a surface molecule which is expressed on different types of cells, including antigen presenting cells, vascular endothelial cells and other cells of human tissues. Expression of PD-L1 is also found on human tumor cells. PD-L1 as the ligand to PD1 receptor molecule of CD8+ T cells inhibits its cytotoxic effect on the tumor cell. The modern target therapy uses this interaction to inhibit the PD-1 molecule of T cells to stimulate tumor necrosis. To compare expression differences, twelve frequent types of malignant tumors with ten patients per group were selected. Immunohistochemical stains with different antibodies for PD-L1 (DAKO, Spring Bioscience, Ventana, Cell Signaling, Biocare Medical, Abcam, Zeta Corporation) were performed, analyzed and compared. To summarize, we detected variable expression pattern of PD-L1 with general higher mean value of expression of tumor cells with clone SP263 in most tumor groups. In the comparison of selected cases of lung cancer, therapy relevant differences of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells with different antibodies were observed. Additionally, the profiling study of several PD-L1-antibody clones (28-8 Abcam and 28-8 DAKO, SP142, SP263) with Signal-to-Amino Acid Residue Plots was performed with interesting findings of cross-activity of SP142 with two peptides from PD-1, which can explain why clone SP142 stains immune cells more intensively, as previously published.",PD-L1,3

Whole tumor cell lysate (TCL) are ideal sources of antigens for cancer vaccine design, which however have limited efficacy due to insufficient immunogenicity. Recently, radiotherapy has been closely related to immunotherapy. Numerous studies have demonstrated the regulatory effect of irradiation (IR) on tumor immune response. Purpose: To explore the immunogenicity modulation effect of IR on lung cancer cells. Methods: RNA-sequence and qPCR assay was used to evaluate the change of tumor antigens expression after repeated X rays radiation on A549 cells. Vaccine based on TCL of irradiated Lewis lung cancer cells (IR-LLC) was established; therapeutic effect of TCL (IR-LLC) was examined in xenografted tumor model of mice. Flow cytometry was conducted to evaluate the rate of immune cells in spleen; ELISA was used to detect the level of cytokines in plasma. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the infiltrations of T-cell in tumor tissues; TIMER analysis was used to explore the correlations between tumor antigen expressions and the abundances of immune infiltrates. Results: IR upregulated the expression of tumor antigens in A549 cells. Compared to the control group and unirradiated tumor cell vaccine, TCL(IR-LLC) had a significantly stronger anti-tumor effect in mice bearing with LLC xenografts. TCL(IR-LLC) significantly increased matured DCs and total CD4+ T cells but downregulated Tregs and PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in mice spleen; TCL(IR-LLC) vaccine upregulated the level of IFN-γ and IL-4 while decreased IL-10 in serum; increased infiltrations of CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells were observed in the tumor issues of mice immunized with TCL(IR-LLC). Tumor antigens including FN1, MFGE8, MMP2, MYL9 may contribute to the enhanced T-cell response. Conclusion: This study confirmed the immunogenicity modulation effect of IR in NSCLC cells, indicating IR might be an effective strategy to enhance the anti-tumor immunity of cancer cell vaccine.",PD-L1,3

Pembrolizumab is one of the most advanced immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer care. Apart from rare and serious adverse effects, its favorable tolerance profile enables to treat fragile patients who have often no other choice than best supportive care. The effective retained dose of pembrolizumab is a venous administration of 200 mg every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerance or up to 24 months. Pembrolizumab has already proven its efficacy and thus obtained marketing authorization in so-called hot or hypermutated tumors or tumors expressing PD-L1 such as melanomas, non-small cell lung cancers, urothelial carcinomas, cervical cancer, etc. Pembrolizumab is also authorized in the United States in the treatment of mismatch repair-deficient tumors or with microsatellite instability. The current challenge is to expand its use in tumor types that are supposed to be less immunogenic, for example, by attempting to warm up the tumor microenvironment, or by combining pembrolizumab with other molecules. An acceptable toxicity profile of such combinations remains to explore. We review here the current indications of this drug, the main prognostic and predictive factors of its efficacy as well as the potential forthcoming indications.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Mar 15.,Pan-TAM Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor BMS-777607 Enhances Anti-PD-1 mAb Efficacy in a Murine Model of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) represent a family of homologous tyrosine kinase receptors known for their functional role in phosphatidylserine (PS)-dependent clearance of apoptotic cells and also for their immune modulatory functions in the resolution of inflammation. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that Gas6/PS-mediated activation of TAM receptors on tumor cells leads to subsequent upregulation of PD-L1, defining a putative PS→TAM receptor→PD-L1 inhibitory signaling axis in the cancer microenvironment that may promote tolerance. In this study, we tested combinations of TAM inhibitors and PD-1 mAbs in a syngeneic orthotopic E0771 murine triple-negative breast cancer model, whereby tumor-bearing mice were treated with pan-TAM kinase inhibitor (BMS-777607) or anti-PD-1 alone or in combination. Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk were differentially expressed on multiple cell subtypes in the tumor microenvironment. Although monotherapeutic administration of either pan-TAM kinase inhibitor (BMS-777607) or anti-PD-1 mAb therapy showed partial antitumor activity, combined treatment of BMS-777607 with anti-PD-1 significantly decreased tumor growth and incidence of lung metastasis. Moreover, combined treatment with BMS-777607 and anti-PD-1 showed increased infiltration of immune stimulatory T cells versus either monotherapy treatment alone. RNA NanoString profiling showed enhanced infiltration of antitumor effector T cells and a skewed immunogenic immune profile. Proinflammatory cytokines increased with combinational treatment. Together, these studies indicate that pan-TAM inhibitor BMS-777607 cooperates with anti-PD-1 in a syngeneic mouse model for triple-negative breast cancer and highlights the clinical potential for this combined therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that pan-inhibition of TAM receptors in combination with anti-PD-1 may have clinical value as cancer therapeutics to promote an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and improve host antitumor immunity.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Feb 14.,A Variant of a Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor Is Associated with Resistance to PD-1 Blockade in Lung Cancer.,"PURPOSE: PD-(L)1-blocking antibodies have clinical activity in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mediate durable tumor remissions. However, the majority of patients are resistant to PD-(L)1 blockade. Understanding mechanisms of primary resistance may allow prediction of clinical response and identification of new targetable pathways. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 35 patients with NSCLC receiving nivolumab monotherapy. Cellular changes, cytokine levels, gene expression, and polymorphisms were compared between responders and nonresponders to treatment. Findings were confirmed in additional cohorts of patients with NSCLC receiving immune checkpoint blockade. RESULTS: We identified a genetic variant of a killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) KIR3DS1 that is associated with primary resistance to PD-1 blockade in patients with NSCLC. This association could be confirmed in independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC. In a multivariate analysis of the pooled cohort of 135 patients, the progression-free survival was significantly associated with presence of the KIR3DS1 allele (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.68; P = 0.017). No relationship was seen in cohorts of patients with NSCLC who did not receive immunotherapy. Cellular assays from patients before and during PD-1 blockade showed that resistance may be due to NK-cell dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: We identified an association of the KIR3DS1 allelic variant with response to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC. This finding links NK cells with response to PD-1 therapy. Although the findings are interesting, a larger analysis in a randomized trial will be needed to confirm KIRs as predictive markers for response to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

The median survival of patients with brain metastases is 1 month without treatment. Novel immunotherapeutic strategies, such as those targeting the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) axis, are promising in patients with advanced systemic disease but are often preferentially administered to patients with tumors showing PD-L1 positivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surgically resected paired primary lung adenocarcinoma and brain metastasis samples of 61 patients were analyzed. We compared the paired samples regarding the amount of peritumoral and stromal mononuclear infiltration, PD-L1 expression of tumor and immune cells, and PD-1 expression of immune cells. We investigated the effect of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and steroid therapy on PD-L1 expression in brain metastases. RESULTS: There was significant positive correlation regarding the PD-L1 expression of tumor cells between the paired primary lung adenocarcinoma and brain metastatic samples with the use of different cutoff levels (1%, 5%, 50%). We found no impact of chemotherapy or steroid therapy on the changes of PD-L1 expression of tumor cells between the 2 sites. There is no or only limited concordance of the proportion of PD-1- or PD-L1-positive tumor-associated immune cells between the paired tumor samples, which suggests that brain metastases develop their own immune environment. CONCLUSION: We observed a strong correlation of PD-L1 positive tumor cells between primary lung adenocarcinoma cases and their corresponding brain metastases, which is not significantly influenced by chemotherapy or steroid therapy.",PD-L1,3

However, immune related adverse events (IRAEs) can occur during treatment. These side effects occur due to stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune system and can lead to serious complications. Recently, acral ischemia has been reported in some cases during treatment with programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors. Here, we discuss a case in which acral necrosis developed after initiation of a PD-1 inhibitor. We offer a review of the existing literature on the pathophysiology, clinical course and treatment outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old female was diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma and was started on pembrolizumab. The patient developed sudden onset numbness and discoloration of fingertips bilaterally at week 25 after initiation of ICI treatment. Extensive workup to rule out hypercoagulable, autoimmune and vascular disease was unremarkable except for mild elevation of ANA and ESR. The symptoms quickly progressed into dry gangrene within four weeks and did not respond to medical or surgical treatment. Pembrolizumab was subsequently discontinued due to progression of metastatic disease. The patient refused further interventions and transitioned to hospice care where she expired after two months. CONCLUSION: Acral ischemia can develop during treatment of malignancies. This complication, although uncommon, canresult in digital amputation. Physicians should be aware of the possible progression of acral vascular necrosis when Raynauds like symptoms develop. Larger studies are needed to confirm the role of ICIs in the pathogenesis of acral vascular necrosis.",PD-L1,3

Systemic anti-tumor reactions due to radiation therapy (RT) can lead to regression of non-irradiated lesions (NiLs), termed abscopal effect"" (AbE). Combination of both treatments can enhance this effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate AbEs during anti-PD-1 therapy and irradiation. We screened 168 patients receiving pembrolizumab or nivolumab at our center. Inclusion criteria were start of RT within 1 month after the first or last application of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and at least one metastasis outside the irradiation field. We estimated the total dose during ICI for each patient using the linear quadratic (LQ) model expressed as 2 Gy equivalent dose (EQD2) using α/β of 10 Gy. Radiological images were required showing progression or no change in NiLs before and regression after completion of RT(s). Images must have been acquired at least 4 weeks after the onset of ICI or RT. The surface areas of the longest diameters of the short- and long-axes of NiLs were measured. One hundred twenty-six out of 168 (75%) patients received ICI and RT. Fifty-three percent (67/126) were treated simultaneously",PD-L1,3

METHODS: Tumor tissue samples were prospectively collected from 183 patients with NSCLC including lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC). PD-L1 expression level was measured by immunohistochemistry assay and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status was assessed by next generation sequencing. Correlations between PD-L1 expressions, TMB status with clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was detected in 37% of ADC group and 55% in SQCC group while all clinicopathological characteristics were found comparable between these two groups. PD-L1 expression was negatively associated with overall survival in ADC group (P < 0.0001) but not in SQCC group (P = 0.418). In consistent with PD-L1 expression level, TMB status was significantly lower in ADC subjects as compared to SQCC subjects (P = 0.024) while PD-L1 positive subgroup and TMB high subgroup shared less subjects within ADC group than SQCC group. More importantly, the combination of TMB status and PD-L1 expression successfully identified responders, who showed significant longer median overall survival than non-responders (32 months vs. 8.5 months) in ADC subjects (P < 0.0001) but not in SQCC subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Here we tested the hypothesis that monitoring TMB, in addition to the existing PD-L1 expression level, could represent valuable non-invasive biomarkers for the chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Further analyses are in need to further assess the prognostic value of TMB for ADC and SQCC patients receiving immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

Clinical features of a thyroid irAE including its predictability and relationship to prognosis remain to be elucidated. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive patients treated with nivolumab at Kyoto University Hospital between September 1, 2014 and August 31, 2017 were included in a retrospective cohort study. We systematically determined and classified subclinical and overt thyroid irAEs based on data collected of serum free T4 and TSH levels. Baseline characteristics and detailed clinical data were analyzed, and analyses of overall survival (OS) excluded patients censored within 1 month from the first administration of nivolumab. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (33.5%) developed thyroid irAEs and these were divided into a subclinical thyroid irAE group (n = 40, 20.0%) and an overt thyroid irAE group (n = 27, 13.5%). Patients with thyroid uptake of FDG-PET before treatment showed high incidences of overt thyroid irAE (adjusted odds ratio 14.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.12-67.19), while the same relationship was not seen with subclinical thyroid irAE. Regarding the total cohort, the thyroid irAE (+) group had a significantly longer median OS than the thyroid irAE (-) group (16.1 versus 13.6 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.39-0.93). In 112 non-excluded patients with lung cancer, the thyroid irAE (+) group similarly had a longer median OS than the thyroid irAE (-) group (not reached versus 14.2 months, HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.27-0.92). However, this observation was not seen in 41 non-excluded patients with malignant melanoma (12.0 versus 18.3 months, HR 1.54; 95% CI 0.67-3.43). CONCLUSIONS: By thyroid uptake of FDG-PET, overt thyroid irAEs could be predicted before nivolumab therapy. Thyroid irAEs related to good prognosis in lung cancer but might be inconclusive in malignant melanoma.",PD-L1,3

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficacy of ICIs between younger and older patients. Materials and Methods: We searched online database and major conference proceedings for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published of ICIs and included RCTs that conducted subgroup comparisons of age with available combination of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Subsequently, we figured out the pooled HR and 95%CI in younger and older patients with a random-effects model and evaluated the within-study heterogeneity by using subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analysis. Results and Conclusion: A total of 12 eligible RCTs included in our study, which reported OS according to patients age. The overall estimated random-effects for HR was 0.75 with 95% CI of 0.65-0.87 in younger arm versus 0.81 with 95% CI of 0.72-0.92 in older arm. ICIs can improve OS for patients with advanced or metastatic lung cancer when compared to controls, especially for those patients with NSCLC, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, non-squamous, Pembrolizumab or Atezolizumab used as well as subsequent-line setting, and the magnitude of benefit in OS had comparable efficacy in both younger and older arms using a cut-off of 65 yr. Conversely, we also drew a statically significant conclusion that older patients failed to acquire benefit from ICIs when subdivided with a further cut-off of 75 yr.",PD-L1,3

Methods: Lung cancer patients (n=115) with advanced metastatic disease, 101 with non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC (77 EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients on chemotherapy, 15 EGFR mutation positive adenocarcinoma patients, 9 patients with mPD-L1 Expression ≥50% NSCLC - responders to immunotherapy), and 14 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were examined. ELISA method was used to determine sPD-L1 and SAA1 concentrations in patients plasma. Results: Significantly higher blood concentrations of sPD-L1 and SAA1 were noted in lung cancer patients compared with a healthy control group. In PD-L1+ NSCLC patients, a significantly higher sPD-L1 level was noticed compared to any other lung cancer subgroup, as well as the highest average SAA1 value compared to other subgroups. Conclusions: It seems that sPD-1/PD-L1 might be a potential biomarker, prognostic and/ or predictive, particularly in patients treated with immunotherapy. Serum amyloid A1 has potential to act as a good predictor of patients survival, as well as a biomarker of a more advanced disease, with possibly good capability to predict the course of disease measured at different time points.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 28.,Programmed Death-Ligand-1 Expression in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Prognosis,"Background: Prognostic significance of the programmed death-ligand-1 status in non-small cell lung carcinoma remains controversial. Aims: To show the programmed death-ligand-1 expression status in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and its effect on the prognosis and the relationship with clinicopathologic data. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: The study included 208 cases who were diagnosed with NSCLC and who underwent surgical resection between 2001 and 2012. Programmed death-ligand-1 (SP142 clone) was applied to the histological sections acquired from the microarray paraffin blocks with immunohistochemistry. Staining intensity was scored as weak (+, 1), moderate (++, 2), and strong (+++, 3). Percentage (0%-100%) was multiplied by staining intensity (1-2-3) to calculate the H score. Four different cut-off values were used; 1: ≥1% (independent of intensity), 2: ≥5% (independent of intensity), 3: ≥5% moderate/strong staining (except for weak staining), 4: H score ≥30 values were considered positive. In this study, staining a single cell at any intensity was considered positive. Results: Thirty-four out 208 cases (16.3%) had PDL-1 positive staining. PDL-1 expression was observed in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma independent of the histological type or subtype (range; 0-25%). When the cut-off level was set to ≥5% with moderate and strong staining, the median overall survival was 45 months for the PD-L1 positive group and not reached for the PD-L1 negative group (p-value 0.024). PD-L1 positivity was significantly higher in patients over the age of 60 years and in cases with a tumor diameter of more than 5 cm (p=0.023 and 0.025, respectively). Conclusion: PD-L1 expression is positive in 16.3% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and may have a negative prognostic value.",PD-L1,3

In humans, the correlation between immune-related gene expression and CD274 (encoding PD-L1) or PDCD1LG2 (encoding PD-L2) was investigated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. In addition, PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression in tumor cells and CD8+ T-cell infiltration were assessed by IHC.Results: In animal models, we showed that PD-L2 expression alone or simultaneously expressed with PD-L1 in tumor cells significantly suppressed antitumor immune responses, such as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and was involved in the resistance to treatment with anti-PD-L1 mAb alone. This resistance was overcome by anti-PD-1 mAb or combined treatment with anti-PD-L2 mAb. In clinical settings, antitumor immune responses were significantly correlated with PD-L2 expression in the tumor microenvironment in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC).Conclusions: We propose that PD-L2 as well as PD-L1 play important roles in evading antitumor immunity, suggesting that PD-1/PD-L2 blockade must be considered for optimal immunotherapy in PD-L2-expressing cancers, such as RCC and LUSC.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Human immune system-engrafted models are used in immuno-oncology (IO) studies for subcutaneous cancer cell or patient-derived xenograft implantations that mimic primary tumor growth. Novel efficacy models for IO compounds on bone metastases need to be established. The study was performed using CIEA NOG (NOG) mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (huNOG) and age-matched immunodeficient NOG mice. Bone phenotyping was performed to evaluate baseline differences. BT-474 human breast cancer cells were inoculated into the tibia bone marrow, and cancer-induced bone changes were monitored by X-ray imaging. Bone content and volume were analyzed by dual X-ray absorptiometry and microcomputed tomography. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of immune checkpoint markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Bone phenotyping showed no differences in bone architecture or volume of the healthy bones in huNOG and NOG mice, but the bone marrow fat was absent in huNOG mice. Fibrotic areas were observed in the bone marrow of some huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors induced osteoblastic bone growth. Bone lesions appeared earlier and were larger, and bone mineral density was higher in huNOG mice. huNOG mice had a high number of human CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells in immune-related organs. A low number of TILs and PD-1-positive cells and low PD-L1 expression were observed in the BT-474 tumors at the endpoint. This study reports characterization of the first breast cancer bone growth model in huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors represent a cold"" tumor with a low number of TILs. This model can be used for evaluating the efficacy of combination treatments of IO therapies with immune-stimulatory compounds or therapeutic approaches on bone metastatic breast cancer.""",PD-L1,3

However, it remains elusive on whether the engagement of PD-L1 to PD-1 leads to tumor-intrinsic signaling. In this study, we aim to explore novel protein substrates participating in transducing this tumor-intrinsic PD-L1 signaling. To this end, we performed a BioID (proximity-dependent biotin identification) assay, in which we fused PD-L1 to BirA* (a promiscuous mutant of bacterial biotin ligase BirA) and overexpressed it in the lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line. Through streptavidin affinity capture and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 57 candidate proteins including 18 PD-L1/PD-1-interaction-dependent neighbors. In addition to this, 9 out of 57 candidates were involved in the EGFR signaling pathway, which is known to play a critical role in tumorigenesis and multiple therapeutic resistances of lung cancer.

However, the predictive value of manual PD-L1 scoring is imperfect and alternative measures are needed. We report an automated image analysis solution to determine the predictive and prognostic values of the product of PD-L1+ cell and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) densities (CD8xPD-L1 signature) in baseline tumor biopsies. METHODS: Archival or fresh tumor biopsies were analyzed for PD-L1 and CD8 expression by immunohistochemistry. Samples were collected from 163 patients in Study 1108/NCT01693562, a Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate durvalumab across multiple tumor types, including NSCLC, and a separate cohort of 199 non-ICT- patients. Digital images were automatically scored for PD-L1+ and CD8+ cell densities using customized algorithms applied with Developer XD™ 2.7 software. RESULTS: For patients who received durvalumab, median overall survival (OS) was 21.0 months for CD8xPD-L1 signature-positive patients and 7.8 months for signature-negative patients (p = 0.00002). The CD8xPD-L1 signature provided greater stratification of OS than high densities of CD8+ cells, high densities of PD-L1+ cells, or manually assessed tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥25%. The CD8xPD-L1 signature did not stratify OS in non-ICT patients, although a high density of CD8+ cells was associated with higher median OS (high: 67 months; low: 39.5 months, p = 0.0009) in this group. CONCLUSIONS: An automated CD8xPD-L1 signature may help to identify NSCLC patients with improved response to durvalumab therapy.

To improve these results, combined approaches are being tested. The addition of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to ICI seems promising. A systematic review was performed in order to assess the safety and efficacy of SABR-ICI combination. Material and Methods: MEDLINE databases from 2009 to March 3, 2019 were reviewed to obtain English language studies reporting clinical outcomes of the combination of ICI-SABR in NSCLC. 18 out of the 429 initial results fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for review. Results: Eighteen articles, including six prospective studies, describing 1736 patients treated with an ICI-SABR combination fulfilled the selection criteria. The reported mean rates for local control and distant/abscopal response rates were 71% and 41%, respectively. Eleven studies reported progression-free survival and overall survival, with a mean of 4.6 and 12.4 months, respectively. Toxicity rates were consistent with the ones attributable to ICI treatment alone.

Immunochemistry (IHC) for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein is the only available biomarker to inform clinical decision-making regarding treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC. Because each PD-1/PD-L1 blockade was approved together with a specific PD-L1 IHC assay used in the clinical trials, pathologists have been challenged with performing various assays with a limited sample. To provide a more unified understanding of this, several cross-validation studies between platforms have been performed and showed consistent results. However, the interchangeability of assays may be limited in practice because of the risk of misclassification of patients for the treatment. Furthermore, several issues, including the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in the tumor, and the potential for cytology specimens to be used as an alternative to tissue samples for PD-L1 testing, have still not been resolved.

Here we report a combined tumour-therapeutic modality based on integrating nanosonosensitizers-augmented noninvasive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. All components of the nanosonosensitizers (HMME/R837@Lip) are clinically approved, wherein liposomes act as carriers to co-encapsulate sonosensitizers (hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME)) and immune adjuvant (imiquimod (R837)). Using multiple tumour models, we demonstrate that combining nanosonosensitizers-augmented SDT with anti-PD-L1 induces an anti-tumour response, which not only arrests primary tumour progression, but also prevents lung metastasis. Furthermore, the combined treatment strategy offers a long-term immunological memory function, which can protect against tumour rechallenge after elimination of the initial tumours. Therefore, this work represents a proof-of-concept combinatorial tumour therapeutics based on noninvasive tumours-therapeutic modality with immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

METHODS: This retrospective study included 137 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab monotherapy (75 women; median age: 65 years), who had a baseline CT and at least one follow-up abdomen CT during therapy. Baseline and all follow-up abdominal CTs performed for monitoring of nivolumab therapy were reviewed to identify the organ-specific abdominal irAEs including colitis/enteritis, hepatitis, biliary toxicity, pancreatitis, nephritis, sarcoid-like reaction, and pancreatic and adrenal atrophy. Their frequency and imaging features were described. RESULTS: Eighteen (13%) patients had radiologically identified abdominal irAEs (median 2.1 months after starting nivolumab; interquartile range 1.17-5.83 months); 16 patients developed enteritis/colitis (12 pancolitis, two segmental colitis, one enterocolitis, one enteritis), two hepatitis, one adrenalitis. One patient with hepatitis also developed colitis/enteritis. Radiographic abdominal irAE occurred after nivolumab therapy was discontinued in six patients before any subsequent therapy was started. IrAEs prompted nivolumab interruption and treatment with steroids in four patients (three colitis/enteritis, one hepatitis). Most common CT features of colitis/enteritis included mesenteric hyperemia (n = 15), bowel wall thickening (n = 13), mucosal hyperenhancement (n = 10), and fluid-filled colon (n = 9). CONCLUSION: Abdominal irAEs were detected on CT in 13% of NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab, and colitis, in the pancolitis form, was the most common irAE.

Now that PD-(L)1 inhibitors are routinely used as adjuvant and first-line treatments, sequential PD-(L)1 inhibition followed by osimertinib use may become more frequent and have unforeseen serious toxicity. METHODS: We identified patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were treated with PD-(L)1 blockade and EGFR- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), irrespective of drug or sequence of administration (total n = 126). Patient records were reviewed to identify severe (NCI-CTCAE v5.0 grades 3-4) toxicity. RESULTS: Fifteen percent [6 of 41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7% to 29%] of all patients treated with sequential PD-(L)1 blockade followed later by osimertinib developed a severe irAE. Severe irAEs were most common among those who began osimertinib within 3 months of prior PD-(L)1 blockade (5 of 21, 24%, 95% CI 10% to 45%), as compared with >3-12 months (1 of 8, 13%, 95% CI 0% to 50%), >12 months (0 of 12, 0%, 95% CI 0% to 28%). By contrast, no severe irAEs were identified among patients treated with osimertinib followed by PD-(L)1 (0 of 29, 95% CI 0% to 14%) or PD-(L)1 followed by other EGFR-TKIs (afatinib or erlotinib, 0 of 27, 95% CI 0% to 15%). IrAEs occurred at a median onset of 20 days after osimertinib (range 14-167 days). All patients with irAEs required steroids and most required hospitalization. CONCLUSION: PD-(L)1 blockade followed by osimertinib is associated with severe irAE and is most frequent among patients who recently received PD-(L)1 blockade. No irAEs were observed when osimertinib preceded PD-(L)1 blockade or when PD-(L)1 was followed by other EGFR-TKIs. This association appears to be specific to osimertinib, as no severe irAEs occurred with administration of other EGFR-TKIs.© The Author(s) 2019.

We investigated the association between the PD-L1 expression and formalin fixation time, and clarified the optimal duration of fixation for accurate PD-L1 evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 55 tumor specimens from resected NSCLC patients. The samples were halved and immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 12-24 h (normal fixation), or 96-120 h (prolonged fixation). Each specimen was stained using two assay systems (22C3 and SP263) for PD-L1. RESULTS: The mean PD-L1 tumor proportion score was not significantly different between normal and prolonged fixation groups for either 22C3 or SP263 (normal fixation: 18.8%; prolonged fixation: 16.3%, p=0.277; normal fixation: 16.2%; prolonged fixation: 17.6%, p=0.560, respectively). CONCLUSION: Formalin fixation duration for up to 120 h does not affect PD-L1 IHC expression. PD-L1 tumor proportion score of tumor specimens can be evaluated by IHC even if these have been fixed in formalin outside the recommended duration in clinical practice.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,The distribution of T-cell subsets and the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and ligands in patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.,"BACKGROUND: Phenotypic characterization of immune cells in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is lacking. METHODS: T-cell infiltration was quantified on BM biopsies from 13 patients with AML, and flow cytometry was performed on BM aspirates (BMAs) from 107 patients with AML who received treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The authors evaluated the expression of inhibitory receptors (programmed cell death protein 1 [PD1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA4], lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3], T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 [TIM3]) and stimulatory receptors (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein [GITR], OX40, 41BB [a type 2 transmembrane glycoprotein receptor], inducible T-cell costimulatory [ICOS]) on T-cell subsets and the expression of their ligands (41BBL, B7-1, B7-2, ICOSL, PD-L1, PD-L2, and OX40L) on AML blasts. Expression of these markers was correlated with patient age, karyotype, baseline next-generation sequencing for 28 myeloid-associated genes (including P53), and DNA methylation proteins (DNA methyltransferase 3α, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1[IDH1], IDH2, Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 [TET2], and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3]). RESULTS: On histochemistry evaluation, the T-cell population in BM appeared to be preserved in patients who had AML compared with healthy donors. The proportion of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in BMAs was higher in patients with AML than in healthy donors. PD1-positive/OX40-positive T cells were more frequent in AML BMAs, and a higher frequency of PD1-positive/cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive T cells coexpressed TIM3 or LAG3. PD1-positive/CD8-positive T cells were more frequent in BMAs from patients who had multiply relapsed AML than in BMAs from those who had first relapsed or newly diagnosed AML. Blasts in BMAs from patients who had TP53-mutated AML were more frequently positive for PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: The preserved T-cell population, the increased frequency of regulatory T cells, and the expression of targetable immune receptors in AML BMAs suggest a role for T-cell-harnessing therapies in AML.© 2018 The Authors.

The expression of PD-L1 is controlled by c-Myc; however, further upstream regulation of PD-L1 expression is largely unknown. We have previously shown that atypical protein kinase C lambda/iota (aPKCλ) phosphorylates the Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor at Ser218 to suppress its DNA-binding ability, thereby regulating c-Myc expression and controlling physiologic and pathologic endothelial proliferation. The presence of phosphorylation of FoxO1 at Ser218 (pSer218 FoxO1) in cutaneous angiosarcoma (CAS) strongly correlates with poor patient prognosis. Here, we reported that patients with PD-L1+ cells in CAS lesions showed significantly worse prognosis compared to those that were PD-L1- . Expression of PD-L1 correlated with that of aPKCλ or the presence of pSer218FoxO1. Moreover, suppression of aPKCλ expression or inhibition of its activity in HUVECs or AS-M, an established human angiosarcoma cell line, resulted in decreased PD-L1 expression. Our results suggest that combined treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and aPKCλ inhibitors could be a novel treatment strategy for CAS patients.© 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Jan 14.,Immunotherapy for the First-Line Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Immunotherapy has fundamentally changed the treatment landscape for many patients with cancer. mAbs targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 immune checkpoints have received regulatory approval across a wide range of tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Indeed, treatment approaches for a majority of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC are evolving rapidly. Only for the small proportion of patients with metastatic NSCLC and genomic-driven tumors with EGFR or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-sensitizing mutations (5%-15%), and possibly BRAF mutations and ROS rearrangements, have initial treatment recommendations remained unchanged, with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors as the preferred therapy. For the remaining patients, an immunotherapy-based regimen alone or in combination with chemotherapy is now the preferred option based on high-level evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials and in accordance with all available guidelines. Deciding between therapeutic options can be difficult due to the lack of direct cross-comparison studies, differences in chemotherapies and stratification factors, and differences in study populations resulting from inclusion criteria such as histology, PD-L1 expression, or tumor mutational burden (TMB). In an attempt to aid the decision-making process, we discuss and summarize the most recent data from studies using immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Jan 4.,Afatinib With Pembrolizumab for Treatment of Patients With Locally Advanced/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung: The LUX-Lung IO/KEYNOTE 497 Study Protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Afatinib is a selective, irreversible ErbB family blocker that has shown survival benefit in lung squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) patients. Pembrolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, has also shown survival benefit in lung SCC. Concurrent inhibition of the PD-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways represents a rational approach to improve responses and delay the onset of treatment resistance in lung SCC. TRIAL DESIGN: This phase II, open-label, single-arm study (NCT03157089) is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with stage IIIB/IV lung SCC that has progressed during/after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Eligible patients must have ≥1 target lesion (as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) and must have not received previous immune checkpoint inhibitor/EGFR-targeted therapy. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile will be determined during a safety run-in with oral afatinib (starting dose, 40 mg/d) with intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks). In the main study, all patients will receive afatinib at the RP2D with pembrolizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 35 cycles. The primary end point is objective response (complete + partial response). Other end points include disease control, duration of objective response, progression-free survival, overall survival, tumor shrinkage, RP2D, and pharmacokinetics. Exploratory biomarker analysis will be performed. This study is being conducted in the United States, Spain, France, South Korea, and Turkey.

In addition to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor mutation burden (TMB), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) is regaining interest as a biomarker in immunotherapy for its availability, accessibility, and reproducibility. High NLR, according to different thresholds, is consistently reported to correlate with poor prognosis in different treatments in several cancers. Yet, most data come from retrospective analysis, and proof of mechanism and principle evaluations are limited. Prospective studies or adequately sized retrospective analyses of prospectively collected data are required to best assess its role in clinical practice. Moreover, effective myeloid or neutrophil modulators in tumor microenvironment can potentially contribute as a new therapeutic strategy.

Epub 2019 Apr 25.,Optimizing Patient Selection to Maximize Drug Efficacy: the Expanding Role of Pharmacogenomics in the Clinical Development of Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4κ class directed against the immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1). Binding to PD-1 prevents its interaction with natural ligands and allows for the reactivation of the immune response against cancer cells. The list of approved indications of pembrolizumab is fast expanding, including its use as first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is a complex and evolving disease. Pharmacogenomics significantly contributed to understanding this complexity, allowing for the identification of molecular biomarkers and novel pharmacologic targets. This approach has delivered more effective and less toxic drugs for advanced NSCLC. In our opinion, pharmacogenomics played a key role in the approval of pembrolizumab as frontline therapy for NSCLC with high expression of the PD-1 ligand, which occurs in ∼30% of patients. Moreover, an analysis conducted on the ongoing clinical trials sponsored by the drugs patent holder shows that the characterization and validation of additional pharmacogenomic biomarkers of response has the potential to extend the frontline clinical use of pembrolizumab in NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Apr 6.,Switch to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) fixed-dose regimen: What is the economic impact?,"BACKGROUND: Nivolumab and pembrolizumab were initially developed using weight-based regimen doses. Recently, fixed-dose regimens were commercialised with reference weights higher than the accurate weight of patients with cancer in routine practice. This may have important economic consequences for healthcare systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Budget impact analysis was performed using real-world data both from Gustave Roussy database and the French National Hospital Discharge database and including patients treated with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Gustave Roussy and in France before the approval of fixed-dosing regimens in Europe. Main outcome is the expected annual budget impact of fixed-dosing regimens in France. RESULTS: From January to April 2018, 978 perfusions of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 were administered at our institution including 560 perfusions of nivolumab in 103 patients and 418 perfusions of pembrolizumab in 125 patients mainly treated for lung cancer and melanoma. The mean extra cost attributable to flat doses would have amounted to €284 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 241-327) per infusion of nivolumab and to €1287 (95% CI: 1200-1373) per infusion of pembrolizumab. Annually, at Gustave Roussy, it would represent an extra cost of € 477 120 (95% CI: 404 880-549 360) and €1 613 898 (95% CI: 1 504 800-1 721 742), respectively, for the year 2018. At the French national level, the expected annual budget impact is estimated at €55 162 211 for the year 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Weight references for fixed-dose regimens do not reflect the accurate mean weight of patients under cancer treatment and are likely to have substantial economic impact for healthcare systems.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Mar 18.,Immunotherapy for small cell lung cancer: mechanisms of resistance.,"INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly malignant disease with a dismal prognosis that is currently being tested for theclinical activity of checkpoint inhibitors. SCLC is associated with smoking and exhibits a high mutational burden. However, low expression of PD-L1 and MHC antigens, as well low levels of immune cell infiltration and rapid tumor progress seems to limit the efficacy of anticancer immunity. Nevertheless, long-term survival was reported from studies using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 agents. AREAS COVERED: Data of clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC show lower success rates compared to NSCLC. The mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy are discussed for their relevance to SCLC patients. EXPERT OPINION: Although some factors, such as a high mutation rate, favor immunotherapy for SCLC patients, downregulation of MHC class I, low expression of PD-L1, poor tumor infiltration by effector T cells, presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells as well as regulatory T lymphocytes counteract the immune system activation by checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, this tumor develops avascular regions which have immunosuppressive effects and restrict access of lymphocytes and antibodies. In conclusion, immunotherapy in SCLC is effective in highly selected patients with good performance status and special and unknown preconditions contributing to long-lasting responses.",PD-L1,3

The clear benefits for patients are undeniable, satisfying the long-awaited necessity of a target-specific therapy. However, its full potential remains still unexploited due to a lack of response in a majority of patients and pending reliable biomarkers. AREAS COVERED: This review provides a summarizing view of the current biological therapies for lung cancer, focusing on immunotherapy - including immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapy and vaccines available in clinical/pre-clinical settings or currently in development. A thorough analysis of the technical and functional differences among all therapies is provided, along with a critical discussion of prospective treatments and potential biomarkers. EXPERT OPINION: The use of immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer has provided clear benefits for patients. Still, exploitation of the full potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination, or adoptive cell therapies is hampered by, amongst other reasons, the lack of reliable biomarkers and possible adverse immune effects. We postulate that the development of liquid biopsy-based diagnostics will help to overcome these limitations in the near future.",PD-L1,3

While immune checkpoint-based therapy yielded impressive results in several advanced solid malignancies such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, its role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is still evolving. Areas covered: Here we review the immunology in the tumor microenvironment in the bone marrow and discuss the current preclinical and clinical data for immune checkpoint-based therapy in myeloid neoplasms. Expert commentary: Clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in AML and MDS are still in early stages and reported results so far have been modest especially for monotherapy use in the refractory settings. However, there are preliminary data for synergistic effects for combination of multiple ICI with hypomethylating agents and conventional chemotherapy. ICI might also be effective in eradicating minimal residual disease and to prevent relapse following induction chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Additional trials to provide insight into the efficacy and safety profile of immune checkpoint-based therapy, its optimal timing and potential combination with other types of therapy as well as identification of predictive biomarkers are needed.",PD-L1,3

Methods: The relevant studies were retrieved and systematic evaluation was conducted. Databases were searched until November 2018. Results: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 6932 patients were included. Patients with the higher PD-L1 expression level tend to have a longer progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR). PFS and OS were significantly prolonged in all the subgroups of PD-L1 expression levels. For patients with PD-L1 expression levels of ≥1%, overall response rates were significantly prolonged, but there was no difference in patients with PD-L1 expression levels of <1% (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.87-3.52; p = 0.12). EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients could benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in PFS (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45-0.91; p = 0.01) and OS (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.62-0.73; p < 0.00001).

Though a majority of patients tolerate treatment, some develop hematologic toxicities, including eosinophilia. Eosinophilia has been associated with better responses in some patients with melanoma, but this has not been investigated in non-small-cell lung cancer. We present a case of a woman with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma who developed asymptomatic hypereosinophilia after initiation of nivolumab. Her eosinophil count temporarily decreased after transiently stopping the medication, but increased again after re-initiation. She had a favorable tumor response to therapy. This exemplifies the potential role of eosinophilia as a peripheral, readily available biomarker of favorable response to immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer.

METHODS: Patients were required to have available data for EGFR mutation, PD-L1 expression, and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. RESULTS: Among 178 patients with EGFR-mutant (n = 38) or wild-type (WT) (n = 140) tumors, the EGFR mutation group had a lower objective response rate (ORR) (15.8% vs. 32.9%, p = 0.04) than the EGFR WT group, similar to the pattern observed for other factors: weak/negative PD-L1 expression vs. strong PD-L1 expression (17.3% vs. 39.2%, p = 0.001); never smokers vs. smokers (19.4% vs. 35.1%, p = 0.03); and females vs. males (21.0% vs. 33.6%, p = 0.08). EGFR mutation and weak/negative PD-L1 expression were associated with a significantly shorter median PFS than EGFR WT (1.9 vs. 3.0 months, p = 0.04) and strong PD-L1 expression (1.6 vs. 3.9 months, p = 0.007), respectively. In multivariate analysis, EGFR mutation predicted worse ORR [hazard ratio (HR) 3.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-8.63] and PFS (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.11-2.75), as did weak/negative PD-L1 expression (ORR, HR 3.46, 95% CI 1.62-7.37; and PFS, HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.17-2.53).

OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs and PD-1 inhibitor with differed doses were applied to treat PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) assay with carboxyfluorescein diacetate/succinimidyl ester staining target cells before treatment and propidium iodide (PI) staining dead cells after treatment were conducted to detect the cytotoxic activity. DRLC mice were constructed by injection of PC9 LCSCs suspension and Matrigel into left lung of SD mice. DRLC mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 CTLs group, OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group, PD-1 inhibitor group, and OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group. In vitro, both CCK8 assay and FCM assay disclosed that OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs plus PD-1 inhibitor presented with elevated cytotoxic activity on PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. In vivo, tumor volume and tumor weight were decreased, while tumor necrosis and tumor apoptosis were increased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group than CMV pp65 CTLs group and control group, and in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group. In addition, CD8 expression was increased while OCT4&SOX2 expressions were decreased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group.

The effects of these immune checkpoint inhibitors in the older patient population has not been adequately assessed. OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of aging on CTLA-4 and PDL-1 inhibitors efficacy and immune-related adverse events (irAE) in the context of real-world management of advanced solid cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective study involved all non-study patients with histologically-confirmed metastatic or inoperable solid cancers receiving immunotherapy at Kingston Health Sciences Centre. We defined older patient as age ≥ 75. All statistical analyses were conducted under SPSS IBM for Windows version 24.0. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Study outcomes included immunotherapy treatment response, survival, as well as number, type, and severity of irAEs.

Melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma accounted for 70%, 22%, and 8% of the study population, respectively. Distributions of ipilimumab (32%), nivolumab (33%), and pembrolizumab (35%) were similar in the study. The response rates were 28%, 27%, and 39% in the age <65, age 64-74, age ≥75 groups, respectively (P = 0.585). Kaplan-Meier curve showed a median survival of 28 months (12.28-43.9, 95% CI) and 17 months (0-36.9, 95% CI) in the age <65 and age 64-74 groups, respectively; the estimated survival probability did not reach 50% in the age ≥75 group (P = 0.319). There were no statistically significant differences found in terms of irAEs, multiple irAEs, severity of grade 3 or higher, types of irAEs, and irAEs resolution status when comparing between different age groups. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that patients age ≥75 are able to gain as much benefit from immunotherapy as younger patients, without excess toxicity. Our findings suggest that single agent immunotherapy is generally well-tolerated across different age groups with no significant difference in the type, frequency or severity of irAEs. Future studies evaluating aging and combination immunotherapy are warranted.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Feb 12.,Impaired Cytolytic Activity and Loss of Clonal Neoantigens in Elderly Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"INTRODUCTION: Whether the efficacy of programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors declines with senescence remains controversial for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Responsiveness to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is thought to rely on neoantigen exposure and immune elements in the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explored the features of the tumor immune microenvironment in elderly patients with treatment-naïve LUAD. METHODS: Transcriptome profiles and clinical characteristics of patients with LUAD were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas as a discovery cohort. Immune cell infiltration (quantified by a single-sample gene set enrichment analysis), immunoregulatory molecule expression, and mutational patterns (from The Cancer Immunome Atlas) were compared between young and elderly patients. Immune cell infiltration was verified by immunohistochemistry using a validation cohort including 105 treatment-naïve patients with LUAD. A tissue microarray consisting of 120 LUAD patients was used in the immunohistochemistry validation. RESULTS: Activated CD8+ T cell numbers increased slightly with age, but cytolytic molecules in T cells (granzyme B [GZMB], perforin 1 [PRF1], granzyme A [GZMA], granzyme M [GZMM], and granulysin [GNLY]) gradually declined. PD-L1 expression was not associated with age; however, a number of immunosuppressive elements beyond PD-L1 were upregulated in aging patients, including regulatory T cells and co-inhibitory molecules, for example, TIM-3, TIGIT, and HHLA2. Finally, senescence was accompanied by a loss of clonal neoantigens, which is believed to be correlated with responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients were characterized by increased numbers of CD8+ T cells and impaired cytolytic molecule expression. The observed immune signature was also associated with a loss of clonal neoantigens and the accumulation of immunosuppressive elements. These findings show a unique immune microenvironment in senescence and support biomarker-guided candidate identification for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutic strategies for elderly patients with LUAD.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Mar 18.,Advanced NSCLC patients with high IL-6 levels have altered peripheral T cell population and signaling.,"OBJECTIVES: High levels of circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) are associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancer including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While the inflammatory cytokine can stimulate the immune system and promote tumor growth, it remains unclear how circulating IL-6 can potentiate a poor prognosis. We hypothesized that a mechanism for IL-6-associated poor prognosis is that these patients would have altered T-cell populations and impaired T-cell signaling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma levels of IL-6 were measured using a Cytometric Bead Array. T-cell populations from Non-small cell lung cancer patients were characterized using surface markers by flow cytometry, and signaling in the T-cell populations were measured by PhosFlow cytometry. RESULTS: We determine that patients with high circulating IL-6 levels had distinct T cell characteristics relative to those with low levels. Patients with high levels of IL-6 had significantly more Treg cells and elevated Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expression on CD4+, CD8+, Treg, and Th17 cells. These patients also showed impaired signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) signaling upon stimulation with IL-6 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and T-Cells from a healthy donor that were treated for four days with IL-6 displayed a similar muting of STAT signaling, which verified the effect seen in patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: This work directly links circulating IL-6 with other poor prognostic indicators, STAT1 and PD-1, and highlights the effects of circulating IL-6 on the immune system. Our data suggest that alteration in T cell populations and function may be a mechanism underlying the poor prognosis seen in NSCLC patients with high IL-6 levels.",PD-L1,3

Regorafenib was the first agent to show a survival benefit over placebo in patients who showed progression while being treated with sorafenib, but it remains an unsatisfactory agent owing to its serious side effects. Therefore, more efficient and milder therapies are needed. PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we report a patient with advanced HCC with many lung metastases who showed progression during sorafenib treatment. DIAGNOSES: HCC with lung metastases (stage IVB). INTERVENTIONS: SHR-1210 alone was used as second-line treatment. OUTCOMES: Although the lung metastases did not decrease 3 months after the treatment, they decreased significantly at 6 months after the treatment and partially disappeared. The tumor response indicated partial response. Furthermore, all of the lung metastases continued to decrease at about 17 months after treatment. The alpha-fetoprotein levels showed a similar trend. After a follow up of 19 months, the patient remains in good health. LESSONS: SHR-1210 alone as a second-line treatment for a patient with HCC showed excellent antitumor effects. We think that SHR-1210 may exert its antitumor effects through a late-onset model, which persist for a long time. The side effects were mild and well tolerated.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 May 1.,Prophylactic TNF blockade uncouples efficacy and toxicity in dual CTLA-4 and PD-1 immunotherapy.,"Combined PD-1 and CTLA-4-targeted immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab is effective against melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer1-3. However, this comes at the cost of frequent, serious immune-related adverse events, necessitating a reduction in the recommended dose of ipilimumab that is given to patients4. In mice, co-treatment with surrogate anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies is effective in transplantable cancer models, but also exacerbates autoimmune colitis. Here we show that treating mice with clinically available TNF inhibitors concomitantly with combined CTLA-4 and PD-1 immunotherapy ameliorates colitis and, in addition, improves anti-tumour efficacy. Notably, TNF is upregulated in the intestine of patients suffering from colitis after dual ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment. We created a model in which Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice were adoptively transferred with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, causing graft-versus-host disease that was further exacerbated by ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment. When human colon cancer cells were xenografted into these mice, prophylactic blockade of human TNF improved colitis and hepatitis in xenografted mice, and moreover, immunotherapeutic control of xenografted tumours was retained. Our results provide clinically feasible strategies to dissociate efficacy and toxicity in the use of combined immune checkpoint blockade for cancer immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 27.,Real-World Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 Inhibitors in the Year Following U.S. Regulatory Approval.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from cancer clinical trials has strong internal validity but can be difficult to generalize to real-world patient populations. Here we analyzed real-world outcomes of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in the first year following U.S. regulatory approval. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data collected during routine patient care in community cancer care clinics. The cohort included patients with mNSCLC who had received nivolumab or pembrolizumab for metastatic disease (n = 1,344) with >1 EHR-documented visit from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2016. Patients with a > 90-day gap between advanced disease diagnosis and first EHR structured data entry were excluded. RESULTS: Estimated median overall survival (OS) was 8.0 months (95% confidence interval 7.4-9.0 months). Estimated median OS was 4.7 months (3.4-6.6) for patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement- and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive tumors, and 8.6 months (7.7-10.6) for patients without such mutations. Age at PD-1 inhibitor initiation or line of therapy did not impact OS. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests OS in real-world patients may be shorter than in conventional clinical trial patient cohorts, potentially due to narrow trial eligibility criteria. The lack of difference in OS by line of therapy or age at immunotherapy initiation suggests sustained benefit of PD-1 inhibitors in multitreated patients with mNSCLC and that age is not a predictor of outcome. Further studies are underway in patients with comorbidities, organ dysfunction, and multiple prior therapies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study evaluated data derived from electronic health records of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in the year following regulatory approval. This real-world cohort had shorter overall survival (OS) indexed to PD-1 inhibitor initiation than reported in clinical trials. Late-line treatment did not influence OS, and patients aged >75 at immunotherapy initiation did not have worse outcomes than younger patients. As new therapies enter clinical practice, real-world data can complement clinical trial evidence providing information on generalizability and helping inform clinical treatment decisions.© AlphaMed Press 2018.",PD-L1,3

Materials and methods: A total of 36 NSCLC patients for whom both the surgically resected specimens of the primary tumors and re-biopsy specimens of the recurrent tumors were available were enrolled in this study. The PD-L1 expression status and tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T lymphocytes (CD8+TILs) count were measured in paired samples by immunohistochemistry. The concordance rate in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) classification based on the PD-L1 expression status and CD8+TILs count was analyzed. Results: While the PD-L1 expression levels were similar between the surgical and re-biopsy specimens in 77.8% of cases, in 16.7% of cases, the expression levels were higher in the re-biopsy specimens. When the analysis was confined to patients who had received platinum-based chemotherapy, the percentage increased to 42.9%. The TIME classification changed in the re-biopsy specimens as compared to the surgical specimens in one-third of the patients, especially in those who had received chemotherapy previously. The TIME classification in the re-biopsy specimens more closely resembled that in the metastatic lymph nodes as compared to that in the primary tumor. Conclusion: In patients with recurrent NSCLC, especially those who have received chemotherapy previously, a recent re-biopsy sample is required to determine whether PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors should be used for treatment or not.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Apr 23.,Molecular characterization of clinical responses to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer: Predictive value of multidimensional immunomarker detection for the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in Chinese patients.,"According to multiple studies, the objective response rate of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the second-line treatment of unscreened non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is only approximately 20%. Predictive biomarkers of treatment efficacies are still under investigation. In selected NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%, the response rate of pembrolizumab in first-line treatment can reach 44.8%. Moreover, patients with a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) tend to achieve a better response with nivolumab. Besides PD-L1 expression and TMB, taking all these indicators into consideration would hypothetically maximize the clinical response in a specific subgroup of patients. Our study aims to accumulate large and complete samples and clinical data to verify the biomarkers and their cutoff values related to the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in Chinese NSCLC patients, and to construct a comprehensive predictive model by combining multi-omics data with contemporary machine learning techniques. NSCLC patients administered treatment of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies or a combination with other drugs have been enrolled. The estimated enrollment is 250 participants. A sophisticated predictive model of immunotherapy response in the Chinese population has not yet been developed. It is clinically and practically imperative to comprehensively evaluate the possible indicators of Chinese NSCLC patients through multiple test platforms, such as next generation sequencing, PCR, or immunohistochemistry.

An effective treatment for SMARCA4-deficient non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) has not yet been established. Correlations between a response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and the SWI/SNF complex have been suggested, but little is known about the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors against SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC. A 43-year-old man underwent left upper lobe lung resection and was diagnosed with SMARCA4-deficient lung adenocarcinoma. Two months after surgery, multiple lung metastases appeared. Immunohistochemical analysis showed no PD-L1 expression. Whole-exon sequencing revealed a relatively high tumor mutation burden at 396. After the failure of three standard chemotherapy regimens, the patient was treated with nivolumab as fourth-line treatment. An obvious reduction in the lung metastases was obtained for more than 14 months. We report the first case of SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC with a high tumor mutation burden successfully treated with nivolumab. Anti-PD-1 antibodies might be a promising treatment strategy for patients with SMARCA4-deficient NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched up to November 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for eligible studies. The outcome of interest was overall survival (OS). The methodology was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Data were pooled by using the random effects model and expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified (I 2 ). RESULTS: Seven RCTs were included in this study. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors achieved superior OS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.82; P < 0.0001). OS was superior in previously treated patients compared to untreated patients (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.63-0.76; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.47-1.44, respectively). No significant differences in OS were observed between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63-0.84, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly prolonged the OS of previously treated patients. No significant differences in OS were observed between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors.© 2019 The Authors.

However the resistance mechanisms of immune checkpoint inhibitors require further investigation. Herein we attempted to determine the possible resistance mechanism of nivolumab in a male smoker with advanced adenosquamous carcinoma. After experiencing disease progression on systematic chemotherapy, he was administered nivolumab as a result of high PD-L1 expression. Larger panel gene detection was performed after the failure of nivolumab treatment to investigate the possible resistance mechanism and a new EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation was detected. After a achieving a response with gefitinib, the patient suffered a rapid relapse and died of tumor progression. This case represents the first time EGFR exon 21 L858R has been detected as an acquired resistance mutation to nivolumab. Patients with high PD-L1 expression may exhibit a poor response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Large panel gene detection remains the optimal choice when confronted with drug resistance.© 2019 The Authors.

[Epub ahead of print],Sex Differences in Tolerability to Anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Are We All Equal?,"BACKGROUND: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have emerged as a serious clinical issue in the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Risk factors for irAEs remain controversial. Therefore, we studied sex differences in irAEs in patients treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-PD-1 therapy at Mayo Clinic Rochester and Florida from 2015 to 2018 were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test was used for time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: In 245 patients with metastatic melanoma, premenopausal women were more likely to experience irAEs (all grades) compared with postmenopausal women and men (67% vs. 60% vs. 46%), primarily because of an increase in endocrinopathies (33% vs. 12% vs. 10%, respectively). In patients with NSCLC (231 patients), women (all ages) were also more likely to develop irAEs of all grades (48% vs. 31%). Women with NSCLC were more likely to develop pneumonitis (11% vs. 4%) and endocrinopathies (14% vs. 5%). No differences in grade ≥3 toxicities were seen across sexes in both cohorts, but women were more likely to receive systemic steroids for the treatment of irAEs compared with men. Better progression-free-survival was observed in women with NSCLC and irAEs (10 months vs. 3.3 months) compared with women without irAEs. CONCLUSION: Women with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC are more likely to experience irAEs compared with men. We also observed differences between sexes in the frequency of certain irAEs. Larger studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of this study suggest that women may be at a higher risk for immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared with men when treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 therapy. In addition, women were more likely to develop certain irAEs, including endocrinopathies and pneumonitis. Close follow-up of women undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors will allow clinicians to diagnose these treatment-related complications early, potentially reducing their associated morbidity and mortality. In addition, a possible association between irAEs and response to therapy was observed.© AlphaMed Press 2019.",PD-L1,3

There has been increasing concern over the benefit of anti-PD-1 antibody in high-risk patients, such as those with preexisting interstitial lung disease (ILD). However, the status and value of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker and the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody in NSCLC patients with preexisting ILD remains uncertain. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of advanced/recurrent NSCLC patients who had undergone analysis of the tumor PD-L1 expression. We identified 358 patients with advanced/recurrent NSCLC who had undergone analysis of tumor PD-LI expression. Of these, 210 received anti-PD-1 antibody. Tumor-cell PD-L1 expression was similar between the groups with and without preexisting ILD (median, 35%; interquartile range, 0-70%; vs. median, 10%; interquartile range, 1-68%; p = 0.66). Of the 210 patients who received anti-PD-1 antibody, 14 patients had preexisting ILD.

In our recent case of a 52-year-old female doctor suffering from breast cancer having metastasized to the lung and liver, it was decided to use nivolumab to prevent the disease progressing after excisional surgeries and multiple chemotherapies. One month after completing the nivolumab course, fatigue, hypoglycemia and hypotension developed and isolated ACTH deficiency (IAD) was diagnosed. A further month later, under steroid supplementation, hyperglycemia emerged alongside thirst and polydipsia, prompting a diagnosis of fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1D). Her susceptibility to type 1 diabetes was examined by HLA haplotype and CTLA4 gene polymorphism analyses. Polymorphisms CT60G>A and +49G>A in CTLA4 both generated a GG genotype. Our patient manifested one of the rarest combinations of autoimmune disease induced by nivolumab. Whereas the HLA haplotype was unsusceptible to autoimmune type 1 diabetes, polymorphisms of CTLA4, the antibody of which frequently causes hypophysitis, were susceptible to FT1D. Peripheral modulation of activated T cells, mainly by PD-1 antibodies, induced FT1D associated with IAD in patients with CTLA4 polymorphism.

However, autoimmune toxic effects are frequent and poorly understood, making it important to understand the pathophysiologic processes of autoimmune adverse effects induced by checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Objective: To gain mechanistic insight into autoimmune skin toxic effects induced by anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was conducted from July 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Patients (n = 73) with non-small cell lung cancer who received anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) were recruited from 4 different centers in Switzerland (Kantonsspital St Gallen, Spital Grabs, Spital Wil, and Spital Flawil). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tumor biopsy specimens and biopsies from sites of autoimmune skin toxic effects were collected over a 2-year period, with patient follow-up after 1 year. Main Outcomes and Measures: Response to treatment, overall survival, progression-free survival, and development of autoimmune toxic effects (based on standard laboratory values and clinical examinations). Results: Of the cohort of 73 patients with NSCLC (mean [SD] age, 68.1 [8.9] years; 44 [60%] men), 25 (34.2% [95% CI, 24.4%-45.7%]) developed autoimmune skin toxic effects. Of the 73 patients with NSCLC, 25 (34.2% [95% CI, 24.4%-45.7%]) developed autoimmune skin toxic effects, which were more frequent in patients with complete remission or partial remission (68.2% [95% CI, 47.3%-83.6%]) than those with progressive or stable disease (19.6% [95% CI, 11.0%-32.5%]) (χ2 = 14.02, P < .001). Nine T-cell antigens shared between tumor tissue and skin were identified. These antigens were able to stimulate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vitro. Several of the antigen-specific T cells found in blood samples were also present in autoimmune skin lesions and lung tumors of patients who responded to anti-PD-1 therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings highlight a potential mechanism of checkpoint inhibitor-mediated autoimmune toxic effects and describe the association between toxic effects and response to therapy; such an understanding will help in controlling adverse effects, deciphering new cancer antigens, and further improving immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

Antibodies targeting Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1)/Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) demonstrated a relevant clinical value in a large number of solid tumors, leading to an improvement of progression free survival and overall survival in comparison to standard chemotherapy. However, across different solid malignancies, the immune-checkpoints inhibitors efficacy is limited to a relative small number of patients and, for this reason, the identification of positive or negative predictive biomarkers represents an urgent need. Despite the expression of PD-L1 was largely investigated in various malignancies, (i.e., melanoma, head and neck malignancies, urothelial and renal carcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer) as a biomarker for ICB treatment-patients selection, it showed an important, but still imperfect, role as positive predictor of response only in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Importantly, other tumor and/or microenvironments related characteristics are currently under clinical evaluation, in combination or in substitution of PD-L1 expression. In particular, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, gene expression analysis, mismatch- repair deficiency, and tumor mutational landscape may play a central role in predicting clinical benefits of CTLA-4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. In this review, we will focus on the clinical evaluation of emerging biomarkers and how these may improve the naïve vision of a single- feature patients-based selection.",PD-L1,3

Six antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint proteins programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4) have been approved. In some cases, response rates have been impressive, but not uniformly so and not consistently; similarly, toxicity to this class of therapeutic is often unpredictable and can be life threatening. Predicting treatment response and toxicity are two main obstacles to truly individualize treatment with ICIs. One of the most severe and life-threatening adverse events is colitis induced colonic perforation, estimated to occur in 1.0 to 1.5% of patients treated with ICIs. An important question to address is, under what circumstances is it appropriate to reinitiate ICI treatment post-bowel perforation? CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 62-year-old woman, who presented with stage IV lung cancer. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that 80% of the patients tumor cells expressed PD-L1. The patient was started on a three-week cycle of pembrolizumab. Subsequent reducing in tumor burden was observed within ten weeks. Initially, pembrolizumab was tolerated fairly well, with the exception of immunotherapy related hypothyroidism. However, the patient experienced a second, more serious immune-related adverse event (irAE), in the form of enteritis, which led to small bowel perforation and necessitated exploratory laparotomy. The concerning part of the small bowel was resected, and a primary anastomosis was created. Based on the pathological and surgical findings, the patient was diagnosed with pembrolizumab-associated small bowel perforation. The patient recovered well from surgery and, considering the patients remarkable response to treatment, a collective decision was made to reinitiate pembrolizumab on post-operative day twenty-eight. The patient is continuing her immunotherapy with ongoing partial response and is able to continue her full-time job. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights the challenges of identifying patients likely to respond to ICIs and those that are likely to experience irAEs and it discusses the impressive work that has been done to start to address these challenges. Lastly, the topic of reinitiating pembrolizumab treatment even after colonic perforation is discussed.",PD-L1,3

We report a patient with brain metastatic lung adenocarcinoma in whom fatal myocarditis developed after sequential use of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. This finding was validated in syngeneic tumor-bearing mice. The mice bearing lung metastases of CT26 colon cancer cells treated with PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitors showed that the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1, either sequentially or simultaneously administered, caused myocarditis lesions with myocyte injury and patchy mononuclear infiltrates in the myocardium. A significant increase of infiltrating neutrophils in myocytes was noted only in mice with sequential blockade, implying a role for the pathogenesis of myocarditis. Among circulating leukocytes, concurrent and subsequent treatment of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors led to sustained suppression of neutrophils. Among tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, combinatorial blockade increased CD8+ T cells and NKG2D+ T cells, and reduced tumor-associated macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells in the lung metastatic microenvironment. The combinatorial treatments exhibited better control and anti-PD-L1 followed by anti-PD-1 was the most effective. In conclusion, the combinatory use of PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade, either sequentially or concurrently, may cause fulminant cardiotoxicity, although it gives better tumor control, and such usage should be cautionary.",PD-L1,3

Significant morbidity and mortality can result, and severe pneumonitis attributed to ICB precludes continued therapy. Thus, discriminating between radiation- and ICB- related pneumonitis is of importance for the increasing number of patients receiving both treatments. Furthermore, data are limited regarding the interplay between radiation- and ICB-induced lung injury, and which biomarkers might be associated with toxicity. CASE PRESENTATION: We report longitudinal clinical and radiologic data, and circulating biomarkers in a melanoma patient treated with axillary radiation followed by ICB who developed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGO) within the radiation field suggestive of radiation-pneumonitis followed by consolidation outside of the radiation field suggestive of ICB-related pneumonitis. Of note, symptomatic radiation-pneumonitis developed despite a low radiation dose to the lung (V20 < 8%), and ICB-related pneumonitis was limited to the ipsilateral lung, suggesting additive effect of radiation and ICB in the development of lung injury. Circulating biomarker analyses demonstrated increases in CXCR2, IL1ra and IL2ra that coincided with the development of symptomatic pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the imaging findings associated with radiation and ICB-related lung toxicity, and anecdotally describe a clinical course with circulating biomarker correlates. This information can help guide clinical evaluation and future research investigations into the toxicity of combined radiation immunotherapy approaches.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],The Diversity of Gut Microbiome is Associated With Favorable Responses to Anti-Programmed Death 1 Immunotherapy in Chinese Patients With NSCLC.,"INTRODUCTION: Gut microbiome affecting the responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors against advanced NSCLC has been investigated in the Western population. However, considering pre-existing genetic and gut microbiota variation, the relevance remains unknown in the East-Asian NSCLC population. This study is designed to explore the relationship between gut microbiome and clinical outcomes in Chinese patients with NSCLC who have received treatment using an anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC receiving treatment with nivolumab were enrolled in CheckMate 078 (NCT02613507) and CheckMate 870 (NCT03195491). Fecal samples were collected at the starting point, when patients received nivolumab, at clinical evaluation, and when disease progression was noted. 16S ribosome RNA gene sequencing was applied to assess gut microbiota profiles. Peripheral immune signatures were determined by multicolor flow cytometry in parallel. RESULTS: When subgrouping patients into responder (R) and nonresponder according to the clinical response assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 1.1, R patients harbored higher diversity of gut microbiome at the starting point with stable composition during the treatment. Patients with high microbiome diversity had significantly prolonged progression-free survival when compared to those with low diversity. Compositional difference was observed between the two groups as well with the enrichment of Alistipes putredinis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Prevotella copri in R whereas Ruminococcus_unclassified enriched in nonresponding patients. Analysis of systemic immune responses using multicolor flow cytometry revealed that patients with a high abundance of microbiome diversity in the gut had a greater frequency of unique memory CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell subsets in the periphery in response to anti-PD-1 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal strong correlation between gut microbiome diversity and the responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients with favorable gut microbiome (such as those with high diversity) exhibit enhanced memory T cell and natural killer cell signatures in the periphery. These findings provide important implications for the prediction and the evaluation of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy against NSCLC in the Chinese population.",PD-L1,3

However, the expression pattern of these receptors on T cell subpopulations of a different activation status and at different sites is poorly characterized. Thus, we analyzed the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on the naïve, activated, memory, and activated memory T cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the lung affected by lung cancer (clBALF), the opposite healthy lung (hlBALF), and peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected from 32 patients. The cells were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry. The proportion of memory, activated, and activated memory CD8+ cells with the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 were elevated in the clBALF when compared to the hlBALF (insignificantly), but these proportions were significantly higher in the BALF when compared with the PB. The proportions of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ T cells were elevated in the squamous cell carcinoma when compared to the adenocarcinoma patients. Also, the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T cells from the BALF was significantly higher than from PB. We report for the first time the differential expression of checkpoint molecules on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes at a different stage of activation in the local environment of lung cancer. Moreover, the circulating T cells have a distinct expression of these receptors, which suggests their poor utility as biomarkers for immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Tumor necrosis correlates with PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in lung cancer are intensively investigated; however, correlations between PD-L1/PD-1 expressions and clinical features or histopathological tumor characteristics determined on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections have not extensively been studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We determined PD-L1 expression of tumor cells (TC) and immune cells (IC), and PD-1 expression of IC by immunohistochemistry in 268 lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) patients, and correlated the data with smoking, COPD, tumor grade, necrosis, lepidic growth pattern, vascular invasion, density of stromal IC, and EGFR/KRAS status of the tumors. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between PD-L1 expression of TC and IC, as well as PD-L1 and PD-1 expression of IC. Tumor necrosis was associated with higher PD-L1 expression of TC and PD-1 expression of IC. A negative correlation was observed between lepidic growth pattern and PD-L1 expression of TC and PD-L1/PD-1 expression of IC. EGFR mutation seemed to negatively correlate with PD-1 expression of IC, but this tendency could not be verified when applying corrections for multiple comparisons. No significant effect of the KRAS mutation on any of the studied variables could be established. CONCLUSION: Here we first demonstrate that the presence of necrosis correlates with higher PD-L1 expression of TC and PD-1 expression of IC in LADC. Further studies are required to determine the predictive value of this observation in LADC patients receiving immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

However, proper predictive factors allowing precise qualification of NSCLC patients for immunotherapy have not been developed so far. Expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and tumor mutation burden are used in qualification of patients to first line therapy with pembrolizumab and atezolizumab in combination with ipilimumab in prospective clinical trials. Nevertheless, not all patients with these predictive factors benefit from immunotherapy. Major methodological difficulties in testing of these factors and in the interpretation of test results still exist. Therefore, other predictive factors are sought. Intensive research on the recognition of tumor immunophenotype and gut microbiome in NSCLC patients are underway. The first correlations between the effectiveness of immunotherapy and the intensity of inflammatory response in the tumor, microbiome diversity, and the occurrence of certain bacterial species in gut have been described. The purpose of our manuscript is to draw attention to factors affecting the efficacy of immunotherapy with anti-PD-L1 antibodies in NSCLC patients. Additional markers, for example TMB (tumor mutations burden) or microbiome profile, are needed to more accurately determine which patients will benefit from immunotherapy treatment.",PD-L1,3

However, immune checkpoints may express differently between primary and metastatic tumor. Therefore, we aimed to compare the differential expressions of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 between the primary and metastatic sites of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with RCC by resection or fine needle aspiration of metastasis were included. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was applied to detect PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressions. SPSS 22.0 was applied to conduct Chi-square, consistency tests and Coxs proportional hazards regression models. GraphPad Prism 6 was used to plot survival curves and R software was used to calculate Predictive accuracy (PA). RESULTS: In the whole cohort (N = 163), IHC results suggested a higher detection rate of PD-L1 in the metastasis than that of the primary site (χ2 = 4.66, p = 0.03), with a low consistent rate of 32.5%. Among different metastatic tumors, PD-1 was highly expressed in the lung/lymph node (65.3%) and poorly expressed in the brain (10.5%) and visceral metastases (12.5%). PD-L1 was highly expressed in lung/lymph node (37.5%) and the bone metastases (12.2%) on the contrary. In terms of survival analysis, patients with PD-1 expression either in the primary or metastasis had a shorter overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.08-2.36, p = 0.02). Also, PD-L1 expression in the primary was associated with a shorter OS (HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.06-6.15, p = 0.04). In the multivariate analysis, the predictive accuracy of the whole model for PFS was increased from 0.683 to 0.699 after adding PD-1. CONCLUSION: PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 were differentially expressed between primary and metastatic tumors. Histopathological examination of these immune check points in metastatic lesions of mRCC should be noticed, and its accurate diagnosis may be one of the effective ways to realize the individualized treatment.",PD-L1,3

Here, we show that pulsatile, rather than continuous, treatment with MEK inhibitors (MEKis) maintains T cell activation and enables their proliferation. Two MEKis, selumetinib and trametinib, induce T cell activation with increased CTLA-4 expression and, to a lesser extent, PD-1 expression on T cells in vivo after cyclical pulsatile MEKi treatment. In addition, the pulsatile dosing schedule alone shows superior anti-tumor effects and delays the emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, pulsatile MEKi treatment combined with CTLA-4 blockade prolongs survival in mice bearing tumors with mutant Kras. Our results set the foundation and show the importance of a combinatorial therapeutic strategy using pulsatile targeted therapy together with immunotherapy to optimally enhance tumor delay and promote long-term anti-tumor immunity.",PD-L1,3

To evaluate the relative benefit in term of Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) of checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone, overall and in subgroups defined by PDL1 expression we have performed a meta-analysis. Data Sources: This meta-analysis searched PubMed and checked references of the selected English language articles to identify further eligible trials. Data collection for this study took place from October 1 to October 24, 2018. Results: In total, 8 trials involving 4,646 patients with advanced NSCLC, 3.314 (71%) and 1.332 (29%) with a non-squamous and squamous histology, respectively, were included in this meta-analysis. Four trials used atezolizumab, 3 pembrolizumab, and 1 nivolumab, accounting for 2.985 (64%), 1.298 (28%), and 363 (8%) of patients, respectively. The patients were randomized to receive first-line chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor vs. first-line chemotherapy, 2,978 patients for the OS endpoint and first-line chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor vs. first-line chemotherapy, 1,740 patients in the PFS endpoint. Checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy were associated with prolonged OS, compared with chemotherapy in the ITT population (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.87; p = 0.0002, with significant heterogeneity among trials). Notably within the PDL1 low group (1-49) there was a significant heterogeneity (p = 0.06) between type of drug and efficacy: the combination of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab showed an OS benefit (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.78; P < 0.00007) unlike the atezolizumab backbone trials (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62-1.37; P < 0.69). However, checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy were associated with prolonged PFS in the ITT (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56-0.66; P < 0.00001) and across PDL1 subgroups. Conclusion and Relevance: Checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy, are associated with significantly prolonged OS and PFS in first-line therapy in NSCLC. In the low PDL1 subgroups the benefit was statistically significant only in the pembrolizumab backbone trials. The findings of this meta-analysis could assist in the design and interpretation of future trials and in economic analyses.",PD-L1,3

LKB1 has an essential role in the control of cellular redox homeostasis by regulating ROS production and detoxification. Loss of LKB1 makes the tumor cell more sensitive to oxidative stress and consequently to stress-inducing treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. LKB1 loss triggers complex changes in tumor microenvironment, supporting a role in the regulation of angiogenesis and suggesting a potential role in the response to anti-angiogenic treatment. On the other hand, LKB1 deficiency can promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment and may be involved in primary resistance to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1, as it has been reported in lung cancer.

Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated survival benefits of alternative treatments to docetaxel. However, information is lacking on which patients benefit the most and what drug or regimen is optimal. We report a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of second-line treatments in all subgroup combinations determined by histology, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Biosciences Information Service (using the Dialog Platform), Cochrane Library, and abstracts from scientific meetings were searched for RCTs published up to September 2015. Key outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Bayesian hierarchical exchangeable NMAs were conducted to calculate mean survival times and relative differences for eight subgroups, using docetaxel as the reference comparator. For OS, the NMA was based on hazard ratios applied to a first-order fractional polynomial model fitted to the reference treatment. For PFS, a second-order fractional polynomial model was fitted to reconstructed patient-level data for the entire network of evidence. RESULTS: The search identified 30 studies containing 17 different treatment regimens. Docetaxel plus ramucirumab was associated with a significant improvement in OS and PFS, relative to docetaxel, regardless of patient type. Docetaxel plus nintedanib showed similar efficacy to docetaxel plus ramucirumab in the nonsquamous populations. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib showed superior levels of efficacy in EGFR mutation-positive populations and the one PD-1 immunotherapy (nivolumab) studied showed superior efficacy in the populations exhibiting high PD-L1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head comparisons, we performed a mixed-treatment analysis to synthesize evidence of the efficacy of each treatment.

We recently observed that high-dose (final concentration in vivo: ~10 µM) crizotinib can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells lacking ALK/ROS1 activation through off-target effects that require the inhibition of several other tyrosine kinases. When combined with cisplatin (which alone does not induce ICD), crizotinib sensitizes NSCLC models to subsequent immunotherapy with PD-1 blockade, allowing to cure more than 90% of established orthotopic cancers. Of note, simultaneous treatment of mice with cisplatin, crizotinib and PD-1 blocking antibodies causes acute hepatotoxicity that can be avoided by a sequential regimen involving initial treatment with cisplatin plus crizotinib, followed by PD-1 blockade one week later. It will be important to translate these results obtained in mice into a clinical trial in NSCLC patients.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Hyperprogressive disease during PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockade with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has been effective in various malignancies and is considered as a standard treatment modality for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, emerging evidence show that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can lead to hyperprogressive disease (HPD), a flair-up of tumor growth linked to dismal prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of HPD and identify the determinants associated with HPD in patients with NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with recurrent and/or metastatic NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors between April 2014 and November 2018. Clinicopathologic variables, dynamics of tumor growth, and treatment outcomes were analyzed in patients with NSCLC who received PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. HPD was defined according to tumor growth kinetics (TGK), tumor growth rate (TGR), and time to treatment failure (TTF). Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood CD8+ T lymphocytes was conducted to explore the potential predictive biomarkers of HPD. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients were analyzed. HPD was observed in 55 (20.9%), 54 (20.5%), and 98 (37.3%) patients according to the TGK, TGR, and TTF. HPD meeting both TGK and TGR criteria was associated with worse progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 4.619; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.868-7.440) and overall survival (HR, 5.079; 95% CI, 3.136-8.226) than progressive disease without HPD. There was no clear relationship between clinicopathologic variables and HPD. In the exploratory biomarker analysis with peripheral blood CD8+ T lymphocytes, a lower frequency of effector/memory subsets (CCR7-CD45RA- T cells among the total CD8+ T cells) and a higher frequency of severely exhausted populations (TIGIT+ T cells among PD-1+CD8+ T cells) were associated with HPD and inferior survival rate. CONCLUSION: HPD is common in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Biomarkers derived from rationally designed analysis may successfully predict HPD and worse outcomes, meriting further investigation of HPD.© The Author 2019.

We previously demonstrated that Plasmodium infection promotes innate and adaptive immunity against cancer in a murine Lewis lung cancer model but its effects on immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment are unknown. METHODS: Whole Tumors and tumor-derived sorted cells from tumor-bearing mice treated with or without plasmodium infected red blood cells were harvested 17 days post tumor implantation and analyzed using QPCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and functional assays. Differences between groups were analyzed for statistical significance using Students t-test. RESULTS: Here we found that Plasmodium infection significantly reduced the proportions of MDSCs and Tregs in the lung tumor tissues of the treated mice by downregulating their recruiting molecules and blocking cellular activation pathways. Importantly, CD8+ T cells isolated from the tumors of Plasmodium-treated mice exhibited significantly higher levels of granzyme B and perforin and remarkably lower levels of PD-1. CONCLUSION: We reveal for the first time, the effects of Plasmodium infection on the expansion and activation of MDSCs and Tregs with a consequent elevation of CD8+T cell-mediated cytotoxicity within the tumor microenvironment and hold great promise for the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies.",PD-L1,3

The emergence of immunotherapies such as antibodies targeting the immune check points has led to significant advancement in the field of cancer treatment since these approaches have overwhelmingly impacted outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Here we report two cases of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with immunotherapy. While one patient achieved an excellent systemic response but developed new metastatic brain lesions, the other showed remarkable systemic as well as central response. These cases highlight variable central nervous system penetration of programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibodies, and we also review the available literature on blood brain barrier permeability of PD-1 antibodies.",PD-L1,3

Neutralizing antibodies targeting immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) have been particularly successful for tumor types with limited therapeutic options such as melanoma and lung cancer. However, reactivation of T cells is only one step toward tumor elimination, and a substantial fraction of patients fails to respond to these therapies. In this context, combination therapies targeting more than one of the steps of the cancer-immune cycle may provide significant benefits. To find the best combinations, it is of upmost importance to understand the interplay between cancer cells and all the components of the immune response. This review focuses on the elements of the complement system that come into play in the cancer-immunity cycle. The complement system, an essential part of innate immunity, has emerged as a major regulator of cancer immunity. Complement effectors such as C1q, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and their receptors C3aR and C5aR1, have been associated with tolerogenic cell death and inhibition of antitumor T-cell responses through the recruitment and/or activation of immunosuppressive cell subpopulations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), or M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Evidence is provided to support the idea that complement blocks many of the effector routes associated with the cancer-immunity cycle, providing the rationale for new therapeutic combinations aimed to enhance the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors.",PD-L1,3

Previous studies have identified several predictive biomarkers, including the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies in NSCLC patients; however, the usefulness of these biomarkers in NSCLCs with EGFR mutations has not been elucidated. The present study was conducted to evaluate the predictive biomarkers for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. We retrospectively analyzed 9 patients treated with nivolumab for EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. All but one patient received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors before nivolumab treatment. The overall response rate and median progression-free survival were 11% and 33 days (95% confidence interval (CI); 7 to 51), respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that patients with a good performance status (P = 0.11; hazard ratio (HR) 0.183, 95% CI 0.0217 to 1.549), a high density of CD4+ T cells (P = 0.136; HR 0.313, 95% CI 0.045 to 1.417) and a high density of Foxp3+ cells (P = 0.09; HR 0.264, 95% CI 0.0372 to 1.222) in the tumor microenvironment tended to have longer progression-free survival with nivolumab. Multivariate analysis revealed that a high density of CD4+ T cells (P = 0.005; HR<0.001, 95% CI <0.001 to 0.28) and a high density of Foxp3+ cells (P = 0.003; HR<0.001, 95% CI NA) in tumor tissues were strongly correlated with better progression-free survival. In contrast to previous studies in wild type EGFR NSCLCs, PD-L1 expression was not associated with the clinical benefit of anti-PD-1 treatment in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. The current study indicated that immune status in the tumor microenvironment may be important for the effectiveness of nivolumab in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],MAPK pathway activity plays a key role in PD-L1 expression of lung adenocarcinoma cells.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have improved the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Still, many patients do not respond to these inhibitors. PD-L1 (CD274) expression, one of the factors that influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, is dynamic. Here, we studied the regulation of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC without targetable genetic alterations in EGFR, ALK, BRAF, ROS1, MET, ERBB2 and RET. Analysis of RNA sequencing data from these NSCLCs revealed that inferred IFNγ, EGFR and MAPK signaling correlated with CD274 gene expression in lung adenocarcinoma. In a representative lung adenocarcinoma cell line panel, stimulation with EGF or IFNγ increased CD274 mRNA and PD-L1 protein and membrane levels, which were further enhanced by combining EGF and IFNγ. Similarly, tumor cell PD-L1 membrane levels increased after coculture with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, using EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and erlotinib or the MEK 1 and 2 inhibitor selumetinib, prevented EGF- and IFNγ-induced CD274 mRNA and PD-L1 protein and membrane upregulation, but had no effect on IFNγ-induced MHC-I upregulation. Interestingly, although IFNγ increases transcriptional activity of CD274, MAPK signaling also increased stabilization of CD274 mRNA. In conclusion, MAPK pathway activity plays a key role in EGF- and IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma without targetable genetic alterations and may present a target to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. © 2019 The Authors.

However, a subset of patients may suffer from severe pneumonitis, and the optimal treatment for this group is not known. Here we describe the case of a patient receiving pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer who developed severe checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis. After treatment with high-dose corticosteroids failed to produce a response, a course of intravenous immunoglobulin catalyzed rapid and durable improvement. In this review, we discuss the current evidence regarding the incidence and outcomes of severe checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis and propose a role for intravenous immunoglobulin as a possible treatment strategy.",PD-L1,3

Several studies have reported that secondary sarcopenia is an indicator of postoperative recurrence. We hypothesized that there is a correlation between the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and sarcopenia. We retrospectively analyzed 38 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with ICIs between February 2016 and April 2018. Patients were divided into two groups according to the change rate of the psoas major muscle area (PMMA) at the L2-L3 position and investigated the correlation between the change rate of the PMMA and the efficacy of ICIs was investigated. The objective response and disease control rates were lower in patients with sarcopenia than in those without sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia exhibited a significantly shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) than non-sarcopenia patients. Moreover, focusing on good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status patients, sarcopenia patients showed a shorter PFS than non-sarcopenia patients. Patients with sarcopenia are associated with poor outcomes for immunotherapy among those with advanced NSCLC, based on retrospective analysis. Further research is needed to validate the clinical biomarkers involved in ICI responders.",PD-L1,3

However, the majority of patients show little to no response or acquire resistance during treatment with checkpoint inhibitors delivered as a monotherapy. Therefore, identifying resistance mechanisms and novel combination therapy approaches is imperative to improve responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. To address this, we performed an in vivo shRNA dropout screen that focused on genes encoding for FDA-approved drug targets (FDAome). We implanted epithelial and mesenchymal Kras/p53 (KP) mutant murine lung cancer cells expressing the FDAome shRNA library into syngeneic mice treated with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Sequencing for the barcoded shRNAs revealed Ntrk1 was significantly depleted from mesenchymal tumors challenged with PD-1 blockade, suggesting it provides a survival advantage to tumor cells when under immune system pressure. Our data confirmed Ntrk1 transcript levels are upregulated in tumors treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Additionally, analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations revealed that Ntrk1 can promote CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Lastly, we found that Ntrk1 regulates Jak/Stat signaling to promote expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells. Together, these data suggest that Ntrk1 activates Jak/Stat signaling to regulate expression of immunosuppressive molecules including PD-L1, promoting exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment.",PD-L1,3

However, the reliability of this marker is still under debate. Moreover, PD-L1 is widely expressed by many immune cell types, and little is known on the relevance of systemic PD-L1⁺ cells for responses to immune checkpoint blockade. We present two clinical cases of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and PD-L1-negative tumors treated with atezolizumab that showed either objective responses or progression. These patients showed major differences in the distribution of PD-L1 expression within systemic immune cells. Based on these results, an exploratory study was carried out with 32 cases of NSCLC patients undergoing PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapies, to compare PD-L1 expression profiles and their relationships with clinical outcomes. Significant differences in the percentage of PD-L1⁺ CD11b⁺ myeloid cell populations were found between objective responders and non-responders. Patients with percentages of PD-L1⁺ CD11b⁺ cells above 30% before the start of immunotherapy showed response rates of 50%, and 70% when combined with memory CD4 T cell profiling. These findings indicate that quantification of systemic PD-L1⁺ myeloid cell subsets could provide a simple biomarker for patient stratification, even if biopsies are scored as PD-L1 null.",PD-L1,3

Here we have explored the role of the ectonucleotidase CD39 in select models of tumor metastases and further tested the therapeutic anticancer activity of the NTPDase inhibitor sodium polyoxotungstate (POM-1). CD39 was expressed on tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Treg), myeloid cells and some NK cells, and it was upregulated on these cells within tumors early after inoculation in vivo. NK cell numbers and effector functions were increased in globally CD39-deficient mice and also in WT mice treated with POM-1. Dosing with POM-1 suppressed experimental and spontaneous metastases in four different tumor models and was well tolerated. This anti-metastatic activity was completely abrogated in mice, that were depleted of NK cells, had IFNγ neutralized or were deficient in CD39 expression in bone marrow-derived cells. POM-1 was highly effective in suppressing metastases when used in combination with BRAFi/MEKi or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 or IL-2. These data highlight the importance of the CD39 pathway in suppressing NK cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and validate further the development of CD39-based therapies in the clinic.",PD-L1,3

PD-L1 is not a specific tumor marker and its expression is also observed in various nonmalignant cells, such as macrophages and lymphocytes, causing confusion in immunohistochemistry analysis when these inflammatory cells are overlapping with tumors cells. The aim of the current study was to examine PD-L1 expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded malignant and nonmalignant cells from human tumors to establish potential characteristic patterns of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues. We used a commercial PD-L1 clone (E1L3N) previously validated in our laboratory to characterize PD-L1 expression in surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas, lung squamous cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and ductal breast carcinomas. We observed different patterns of PD-L1 expression by malignant cells and nonmalignant cells as membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear expression. The distribution of expression was variable including the entire malignant cells population, heterogonous with random distribution, peripheral distribution, minimal expression by few cells and negative expression. Similar, nonmalignant cells showed randomly and peripherally distribution through the tumors. We concluded that the PD-L1 cell protein expression patterns and distributions are variable and differ between resected tumor specimens. The expression and distribution pattern described here provide a useful knowledgment of PD-L1 expression in tumor samples.",PD-L1,3

The information regarding the pulmonary safety of such therapy remains limited to mostly retrospective studies and case reports with a small portion of data from prospective clinical trials.

Epub 2019 Apr 8.,Increased expression of the immunosuppressive interleukin-35 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The immunosuppressive role of the cytokine IL-35 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poorly understood. In this study, we analysed the localisation and regulation of IL-35 in the lung of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to further elucidate the immune-escape of cancer cells in perioperative course of disease. METHODS: Interleukin 35 (IL-35) was measured by ELISA in postoperative serum from 7 patients with NSCLC as well as 8 samples from healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry, FACS analysis, real-time PCR, as well as western blot from samples of the control (CTR), peri-tumoural (PT) and the tumoural (TU) region of the lung derived from patients with NSCLC and 10 controls were performed. RESULTS: Here we found elevated levels of IL-35 in the TU region as well as postoperative serum from patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Consistently, we found an increased expression of IL-35+Foxp-3+ cells, which associated with ARG1 mRNA expression and decreased TNFA in the TU region of the lung of patients with NSCLC as compared to their CTR region. Furthermore, in the CTR region of the lung of patients with NSCLC, CD68+ macrophages were induced and correlated with IL-35+ cells. Finally, IL-35 positively correlated with TTF-1+PD-L1+ cells in the TU region of NSCLC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Induced IL-35+Foxp3+ cell numbers in the TU region of the lung of patients with NSCLC associated with ARG1 mRNA expression and with TTF-1+PD-L1+ cells. In the tumour-free CTR area, IL-35 correlated with CD68+ macrophages. Thus inhibitors to IL-35 would probably succeed in combination with antibodies against immune checkpoints like PD-L1 and PD-1 currently used against NSCLC because they would inhibit immunosuppressive macrophages and T regulatory cells while promoting T cell-mediated anti-tumoural immune responses in the microenvironment as well as the TU region of NSCLC patients.",PD-L1,3

METHODS: The clinical features, PD-L1 tumor proportion scores, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (PDi) outcomes (objective response rate and progression-free survival) of patients who had advanced NSCLC with Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations or common, actionable oncogenic drivers were captured. RESULTS: In total, 189 oncogene-positive patients were analyzed. Of these, 104 received a PDi, and 108 had undergone prior PD-L1 testing. The frequency of PD-L1 positivity (≥1%) was higher in patients who had KRAS mutations (P = .031), smokers (P = .006), and non-Asian patients (P = .002). Multivariable analysis indicated that smoking status (P < .001) was the only factor associated significantly with KRAS mutation. The objective response rate to PDi treatment was 16.9% (11 of 65 patients) among smokers (17.3% in the KRAS-mutant and 15.4% in the non-KRAS-mutant smoker subgroups), which was significantly higher than the 0% rate (0 of 26 patients; P = .019) among never-smokers. In subgroup analyses, progression-free survival was influenced by KRAS mutation status (median, 4.57 vs 1.63 months; P = .004), smoking status (4.07 vs 1.73 months; P = .004), PD-L1 positivity (3.8 vs 1.2 months; P = .040), and non-Asian race (3.0 vs 1.97 months; P = .046). In multivariable analysis, only smoking status (P = .008) remained a significant predictor when a PD-L1 level ≥1% was used. However, both smoking status (P = .001) and PD-L1 status (P = .028) were independent predictors when a PD-L1 level ≥50% was used. CONCLUSIONS: Among associated clinical features among patients who have NSCLC with oncogenic drivers, smoking status potentially was the most important, easily available predictor of single PDi efficacy.© 2018 American Cancer Society.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Feb 12.,Low-Dose Apatinib Optimizes Tumor Microenvironment and Potentiates Antitumor Effect of PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade in Lung Cancer.,"The lack of response to treatment in most lung cancer patients suggests the value of broadening the benefit of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy. Judicious dosing of antiangiogenic agents such as apatinib (VEGFR2-TKI) can modulate the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, which contributes to resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. We therefore hypothesized that inhibiting angiogenesis could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Here, using a syngeneic lung cancer mouse model, we demonstrated that low-dose apatinib alleviated hypoxia, increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, reduced recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages in tumor and decreased TGFβ amounts in both tumor and serum. Combining low-dose apatinib with anti-PD-L1 significantly retarded tumor growth, reduced the number of metastases, and prolonged survival in mouse models. Anticancer activity was evident after coadministration of low-dose apatinib and anti-PD-1 in a small cohort of patients with pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Overall, our work shows the rationale for the treatment of lung cancer with a combination of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and low-dose apatinib.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Jan 15.,The First-week Proliferative Response of Peripheral Blood PD-1+CD8+ T Cells Predicts the Response to Anti-PD-1 Therapy in Solid Tumors.,"PURPOSE: To investigate blood-based dynamic biomarkers that predict responses to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy in solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Preplanned biomarker analysis was performed as part of a phase II clinical trial (NCT02607631) in patients with metastatic or refractory thymic epithelial tumors (TETs; n = 31) who received pembrolizumab. The biomarker was further tested in an independent cohort of prospectively recruited patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received pembrolizumab or nivolumab (NSCLC cohort 1; n = 33) and validated in an independent cohort of patients with NSCLC (NSCLC cohort 2; n = 46). Peripheral blood samples were obtained immediately before treatment (D0) and 7 days after the first dose (D7) and analyzed using multi-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: A higher fold-change in the percentage of Ki-67+ cells among PD-1+CD8+ T cells 7 days after the first dose (Ki-67D7/D0) significantly predicted durable clinical benefit (DCB; P < 0.001) and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.027) in patients with TETs. Ki-67D7/D0 ≥ 2.8 was also associated with better DCB, PFS, and overall survival (OS) in NSCLC cohort 1 (all P < 0.05). Ki-67D7/D0 was subsequently validated in NSCLC cohort 2, and Ki-67D7/D0 ≥ 2.8 significantly predicted better DCB (P = 0.001), PFS (P = 0.002), and OS (P = 0.037). Ki-67D7/D0 had a low correlation with tumor PD-L1 expression and combining both factors did not improve the predictive power of Ki-67D7/D0. CONCLUSIONS: The proliferative response of peripheral blood PD-1+CD8+ T cells, measured as the fold-change in the percentage of Ki-67+ cells 7 days after treatment (Ki-67D7/D0), may be a useful surrogate biomarker for predicting the response and prognosis to anti-PD-1 therapy in solid tumors.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Jan 14.,"Induction of Peripheral Effector CD8 T-cell Proliferation by Combination of Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, and Bevacizumab in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients.","PURPOSE: Chemotherapy has long been the standard treatment for advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but checkpoint inhibitors are now approved for use in several patient groups and combinations. To design optimal combination strategies, a better understanding of the immune-modulatory capacities of conventional treatments is needed. Therefore, we investigated the immune-modulatory effects of paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab (PCB), focusing on the immune populations associated with the response to checkpoint inhibitors in peripheral blood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 223 patients with stage IV NSCLC, enrolled in the NVALT12 study, received PCB, with or without nitroglycerin patch. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline and after the first and second treatment cycle, proportions of T cells, B cells, and monocytes were determined by flow cytometry. Furthermore, several subsets of T cells and the expression of Ki67 and coinhibitory receptors on these subsets were determined. RESULTS: Although proliferation of CD4 T cells remained stable following treatment, proliferation of peripheral blood CD8 T cells was significantly increased, particularly in the effector memory and CD45RA+ effector subsets. The proliferating CD8 T cells more highly expressed programmed death receptor (PD)-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) compared with nonproliferating CD8 T cells. Immunologic responders (iR; >2 fold increased proliferation after treatment) did not show an improved progression-free (PFS) or overall survival (OS). CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab induces proliferation of CD8 T cells, consisting of effector cells expressing coinhibitory checkpoint molecules. Induction of proliferation was not correlated to clinical outcome in the current clinical setting. Our findings provide a rationale for combining PCB with checkpoint inhibition in lung cancer.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Immune checkpoint therapy, which targets regulatory pathways in T cells to boost anti-tumor immune response, has revolutionized lung cancer treatment paradigms. Inhibitors of the most established immune checkpoints such as programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in the management of lung cancer. Despite the pronounced survival benefits that have been seen with immune checkpoint inhibitors, not all lung cancer patients respond to single-agent immunotherapy due to the complexity of the immune microenvironment and tumor resistance. Alternative immune checkpoints beyond PD-1/PD-L1 must be sought so that more patients can benefit from immune checkpoint therapy. Additionally, novel combination strategies of immunotherapy and conventional treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy) have shown promise in some clinical trials. Meanwhile, identification of predictive biomarkers is pivotal in selecting eligible patients for immunotherapy and to guide individualized clinical decision-making. The future of immune checkpoint therapy in lung cancer is not devoid of challenges, and more prospective clinical studies are awaited to translate our understanding from bench to bedside.",PD-L1,3

We report 2 cases of patients with a lung sarcomatoid carcinoma. Both patients initially underwent curative lung resection, but developed early recurrent disease. Because PD-L1 was highly expressed in the tumour cells, we initiated therapy with nivolumab, which showed good efficacy, almost complete radiologic tumour remission, and a remarkable improvement in the condition of those patients.

Epub 2019 Mar 14.,Simultaneous blocking of CD47 and PD-L1 increases innate and adaptive cancer immune responses and cytokine release.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment multiple tumors by immune therapy can be achieved by mobilizing both innate and adaptive immunity. The programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1; or CD274, B7-H1) is a critical dont find me signal to the adaptive immune system. Equally CD47 is a critical dont eat me signal to the innate immune system and a regulator of the adaptive immune response. METHOD: Both of CD47 and PD-L1 are overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells to enable to escape immune-surveillance. We designed EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule)-targeted cationic liposome (LPP-P4-Ep) containing si-CD47 and si-PD-L1 could target high-EpCAM cancer cells and knockdown both CD47 and PD-L1 proteins. FINDINGS: Efficient silencing of CD47 and PD-L1 versus single gene silencing in vivo by systemic administration of LPP-P4-Ep could significantly inhibited the growth of solid tumors in subcutaneous and reduced lung metastasis in lung metastasis model. Target delivery of the complexes LPP-P4-Ep increased anti-tumor T cell and NK cell response, and release various cytokines including IFN-γ and IL-6 in vivo and in vitro. INTERPRETATION: This multi-nanoparticles showed significantly high-EpCAM tumor targeting and lower toxicity, and enhanced immune therapeutic efficacy. Our data indicated that dual-blockade tumor cell-specific innate and adaptive checkpoints represents an improved strategy for tumor immunotherapy.

Survival data obtained from clinical trials shape the cut-offs and IHC scoring that serve as recommendations for patient selection both for targeted and conventional therapies. Assessment of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors along with HER2 status has been among the first approved immunostaining assays revolutionizing breast cancer treatment. Similarly, ALK positivity predicts the efficacy of ALK inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In recent years, Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC assays have been approved as companion or complimentary diagnostic tools predicting the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have inaugurated a new period in the treatment of advanced cancers, but the path to approval of these biomarkers is filled with immunohistochemical challenges. The latter brings to the fore the significance of molecular pathology as a hub between basic and clinical research. Besides, novel markers are translated into routine practice, suggesting that we are at the beginning of a new exciting period. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular homeostasis unfolds biomarkers with greater specificity and sensitivity.

We explored the relationship of PD-L1 and malignant behavior in 77 cases of PCC/PGL using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess protein expression and RNAscope to detect mRNA expression in 20 cases. The IHC data showed that 59.74% of the PCCs/PGLs expressed PD-L1, and the extent of expression was highly correlated with Ki-67 (P = .019) and hypertension (P = .013) but not with age, sex, tumor size, capsular invasion, tumor necrosis, relapse/distant metastasis, secretion of noradrenaline/adrenaline/dopamine, or diabetes mellitus. In addition, we found an excellent correlation of PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression with a κ coefficient of 0.828, and further stratification of the IHC and RNAscope findings showed high consistency (Pearson coefficient 0.753).

However, therapeutic resistance is increasingly observed, and the mechanisms underlying anti-PD-L1 (aPD-L1) antibody treatment have not been clarified yet. Here, we identified two unique secreted PD-L1 splicing variants, which lacked the transmembrane domain, from aPD-L1-resistant NSCLC patients. These secreted PD-L1 variants worked as decoys of aPD-L1 antibody in the HLA-matched coculture system of iPSC-derived CD8 T cells and cancer cells. Importantly, mixing only 1% MC38 cells with secreted PD-L1 variants and 99% of cells that expressed wild-type PD-L1 induced resistance to PD-L1 blockade in the MC38 syngeneic xenograft model. Moreover, anti-PD-1 (aPD-1) antibody treatment overcame the resistance mediated by the secreted PD-L1 variants. Collectively, our results elucidated a novel resistant mechanism of PD-L1 blockade antibody mediated by secreted PD-L1 variants.© 2019 Gong et al.",PD-L1,3

Unfortunately, the management of steroid-refractory immune mediated adverse events is based on a paucity of randomized data and limited to single center experiences. Our initial experience with the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab showed clinical improvement in a wide variety of irAEs. As a result, we adopted the use of tocilizumab for the management of steroid refractory irAEs. METHODS: The character and clinical course of irAEs were abstracted from the medical record and analyzed. The dose of tocilizumab was 4 mg/kg given IV over one hour. C-reactive protein was drawn at first nivolumab infusion and at q two weeks (and with irAEs) thereafter. Clinical improvement was defined as either: documentation of resolution of symptoms or hospital discharge within seven days. RESULTS: Of the initial 87 patients that were treated with nivolumab, 34 required tocilizumab (39.1%). All patients were on corticosteroids. The majority (88.2%) were lung cancer patients. The index grade 3/4 irAE was pneumonitis in 35.3%, serum sickness/SIRS in 35.3%, cerebritis in 14.7% and one case each of hypophysitis, colitis, pancreatitis, hepatitis and immune mediated coagulopathy. Median time between first nivolumab and initiation of tocilizumab was 76 days (range 1-429). There was a statistically significant increase in C-reactive protein from a median of 23 mg/L (range 0.1-238.5) at baseline to 109.3 mg/L (21.5-350.4) at the time of index irAE, followed by a decrease to 19.2 mg/L (0.25-149) after tocilizumab ( p < 0.00001). Clinical improvement was noted in 27/34 patients (79.4%). Some patients (52.9%) required a single dose, while 38.2% required two, 8.8% required three and 1 patient required four doses. Twenty-seven doses were given in the inpatient setting (49.1%). Median time to discharge was four days (range 1-27). Seventy-four percent of patients were discharged home. For the 53 doses of tocilizumab that were delivered when infliximab was an option, there was a cost savings of $141,048.72 (WAC) during the 18 month study period. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab may be a therapeutic option for the management of steroid refractory irAEs secondary to immune checkpoint blockade.

Methods: We analyzed the clinicopathological data of 44 cases of advanced NSCLC targeted with ICIs in our hospital, between February 2016 and February 2018, in order to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. We also reviewed the literature regarding ICIs. Result: We retrospectively analyzed the 44 cases (26 nivolumab and 18 pembrolizumab cases). These patients were 38 men and 6 women, comprising 13 cases of adenocarcinoma, 29 squamous cell carcinoma and 2 unclassified types. Seven patients were using first-line therapy and while the others were using second-line therapy or later. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations were negative in all the cases. The response rate and disease control rate were 20.5% and 51.3%, respectively. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 146 days and 257 days, respectively. We observed five severe adverse effects (AEs) (three cases of interstitial pneumonia, one of liver dysfunction and one of adrenal failure), that were resolved by steroid pulse therapy. In multivariate analyses, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), pathological type, standardized uptake value (SUV) on positron emission tomography (PET), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin were independently prognostic factors.

Here, we aimed to investigate the predictive and prognostic value of blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive online search to explore the association between blood NLR and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Published data including hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were eligible. Pooled estimates of treatment outcomes were calculated using Stata/MP 14.1. RESULTS: 1700 patients from sixteen studies were included. The pooled results suggested that high blood NLR was correlated with significantly shorter OS (HR = 2.07, P < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 1.59, P < 0.001). The predictive and prognostic significance of blood NLR were observed consistently across most subgroups including publication year, study design, research region, PD-L1 expression detection, sample size, NLR cutoff, median follow-up time and study quality score. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between elevated NLR cutoff values and OS benefit (r = 0.585, P =  0.036) but not for PFS benefit (r = 0.198, P =  0.496). Notably, HRs of PFS showed significant correlation with HRs of OS (r = 0.686, P =  0.041). CONCLUSION: Elevated blood NLR was associated with shorter PFS and OS in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting its potential predictive and prognostic value in this clinical scenario.",PD-L1,3

We report results from dose-finding and dose-expansion cohorts of the phase 1/2 KEYNOTE-021 study that evaluated combination therapy with anti‒programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab plus anti‒cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab in patients with previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria stipulated histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC and treatment failure on ≥1 prior systemic therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted therapy for patients with EGFR/ALK aberrations). In the dose-finding cohort, patients initially received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 or 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy for up to 2 years. Based on emerging published data, subsequent patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. Objective response rate (ORR; primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded, independent central review. Phase 2 hypothesis that ORR would be greater than the 20% rate for historical controls was evaluated using the exact binomial test. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 71% received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at any dose level. Among patients who received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 44), ORR was 30% (95% CI, 17%-45%), but not statistically significantly >20% (P = 0.0858). Median progression-free survival in this group was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.4-5.8) months; median overall survival was 10.9 (95% CI, 6.1-23.7) months. With pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, incidences of treatment-related adverse events, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events, and immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions were 64%, 29%, and 42%, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data including ANA status were reviewed retrospectively for patients with advanced NSCLC who received monotherapy with a PD-1 inhibitor. RESULTS: Of the 83 patients analyzed, 18 (21.7%) were positive for ANA. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) did not differ significantly between patients with ANA (6/18, 33.3%) and those negative for ANA (21/65, 32.3%), although it tended to increase as the ANA titer increased. Progression-free survival (2.9 versus 3.8 months, p =  0.03) and overall survival (11.6 versus 15.8 months, p =  0.03) were significantly shorter in patients positive for ANA than in those without ANA. CONCLUSION: PD-1 inhibitors can be administered safely in advanced NSCLC patients positive for ANA without obvious exacerbation of autoimmune disease, although patients with a high titer of such antibodies may warrant close monitoring. However, the presence of ANA might be associated with a poor outcome of such treatment.",PD-L1,3

Clinical outcomes and clinicopathologic features were compared according to the status of Abx or PPIs co-administration. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were included. Of them, 20 (18.3%) patients were categorized in Abx-treated group. No major difference in baseline characteristics was observed between Abx-treated and -untreated groups. Concomitant Abx treatment was significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p < 0.0001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0021). And primary disease progression tended to increase in Abx-treated group (p = 0.092). Yet, the occurrence and grades of irAEs were comparable between two groups. In multivariable analysis, Abx treatment was markedly associated with worse PFS (HR=0.32, 95%CI 0.18-0.59, p < 0.0001) and OS (HR=0.35, 95%CI 0.16-0.77, p = 0.009). Regarding the use of PPIs, no significant difference was observed in clinical outcomes between the patients with or without concomitant PPIs treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Abx treatment was significantly associated with attenuated clinical outcomes derived from anti-PD-1-based ICIs in a Chinese cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Nov 6.,Programmed death ligand-1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer in a Western Australian population and correlation with clinicopathologic features.,"Immune checkpoint inhibition is an important therapeutic option in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression may serve as a predictive marker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The relationship between non-small cell lung cancer PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics remains unclear and there is no population level Australian data. We report the results of PD-L1 testing in patients with non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed at major Western Australian public hospitals served by a single state Pathology provider. We analyzed PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 241 non-small cell lung cancer specimens using the 22C3 clone on a Dako autostainer platform. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was scored as Tumor Proportion Score and categorized using pre-specified subsets of  1%, 1-49% and  ≥  50% for correlation with clinicopathologic features. PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was  1% in 65 (27%) cases, 1-49% in 100 (41%) cases and  ≥  50% in 76 (32%) cases. PD-L1-positive rate was 92% in squamous cell carcinomas and 67% in adenocarcinomas. PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was higher in squamous cell carcinomas (p  =  0.004) and lower in adenocarcinomas (p  =  0.003). Of the 196 non-squamous carcinomas, 35% had rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) mutations, 13% had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, 2% had anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations and 2% had ROS1 translocations. Tumor Proportion Score  ≥  50% was seen in 34% (23/68), 28% (7/25) and 25% (1/4) of RAS, EGFR mutant, and ALK translocated carcinomas, respectively. There was no significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and molecular or genetic abnormalities, or other parameters including age, gender, stage, and smoking status. In our patient cohort, PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas and lower in adenocarcinomas. The overall prevalence of Tumor Proportion Score  ≥  50% is consistent with that reported in clinical trials.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Oct 26.,Differential expression of PD-L1 and IDO1 in association with the immune microenvironment in resected lung adenocarcinomas.,"Like programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is known to exert immunosuppressive effects and be variably expressed in human lung cancer. However, IDO1 expression has not been well studied in lung adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 and IDO1 expression was evaluated in 261 resected lung adenocarcinomas using tissue microarrays and H-scores (cutoff: 5). We compared IDO1 and PD-L1 expression with clinical features, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, HLA class I molecule expression, molecular alterations, and patient outcomes. There was expression of PD-L1 in 89 (34%) and IDO1 in 74 (29%) cases, with co-expression in 49 (19%). Both PD-L1 and IDO1 were significantly associated with smoking, aggressive pathologic features, and abundant CD8+ and T-bet+ (Th1 marker) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. PD-L1 expression was also associated with preserved HLA class I molecule expression (p = 0.002). Compared to PD-L1+/IDO1+ and PD-L1+ only cases, significantly fewer IDO1+ only cases had abundant CD8+ and T-bet+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (p < 0.001, respectively). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with EGFR wild-type (p < 0.001) and KRAS mutants (p = 0.021), whereas isolated IDO1 expression was significantly associated with EGFR mutations (p = 0.007). As for survival, PD-L1 was a significant predictor of decreased progression-free and overall survival by univariate but not multivariate analysis, while IDO1 was not associated with progression-free or overall survival. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the 5-year progression-free and overall survival (p = 0.004 and 0.038, respectively), where cases without PD-L1 or IDO1 expression had the longest survival, and those with PD-L1 alone had the shortest survival. While PD-L1+/-IDO1 expression is observed in association with HLA class I expression, cytotoxic T lymphocyte/Th1 microenvironments, EGFR wild-type, and KRAS mutations, isolated IDO1 expression does not demonstrate these associations, suggesting that IDO1 may serve a distinct immunosuppressive role in lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, further investigation of IDO1 may demonstrate its role as a potential biomarker for patients who undergo anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.",PD-L1,3

Immunomodulation via checkpoint inhibition has provided encouraging results in non-CNS malignancies, but prediction of responders has proven to be challenging in glioblastoma patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients who have a measurable increase of interferon gamma levels in brain tumor tissue after their first dose of nivolumab, and to evaluate the safety of using brain tumor microdialysis to monitor for immune response while evaluating the safety of the combination of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) and anti-lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) checkpoint inhibition. METHODS: The study design is a single-center, nonrandomized phase 1 clinical trial. Up to 15 adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma will be enrolled with the goal of 10 patients completing the trial over an anticipated 18 mo. Patients will undergo biopsy; placement of microdialysis catheters and lumbar drains; treatment with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition; comprehensive immune biomarker collection; tumor resection; and then treatment with anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibition until progression. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect interferon gamma levels to increase in the brain as measured via microdialysis in treated patients. Based on published reports, microdialysis in this patient population is expected to be safe, and anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 combined will likely have a similar side effect profile to other checkpoint inhibitor combinations. DISCUSSION: The failure of recent trials of immune therapies in glioblastoma underscores the need to appropriately measure response in the treated tissue. This trial may provide insight on indicators of which patients will respond to immune therapy.",PD-L1,3

Thyroid dysfunctions are the most common endocrine toxicities. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of thyroid dysfunctions during treatment with a PD-1 monoclonal antibody (nivolumab) in patients with NSCLC. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients treated with nivolumab for NSCLC between May 2015 and December 2016; euthyroidism within the 3 months preceding immunotherapy; monitoring of thyroid function tests until stopping nivolumab, death or February 2017. Patients treated with levothyroxine, amiodarone or another immunotherapy were excluded. RESULTS: Among 183 patients treated, 105 fullfilled the inclusion criteria (72 males, median age: 61 years [range: 41-80]).

Epub 2019 Feb 11.,Radiochemotherapy combined with NK cell transfer followed by second-line PD-1 inhibition in a patient with NSCLC stage IIIb inducing long-term tumor control: a case study.,"BACKGROUND: Membrane heat shock protein 70 (mHsp70) is indicative of high-risk tumors and serves as a tumor-specific target for natural killer (NK) cells stimulated with Hsp70 peptide (TKD) and Interleukin(IL)-2. Radiochemotherapy (RCT), mHsp70-targeting NK cells, and programmed death(PD)-1 inhibition were combined to improve the efficacy of tumor-specific immune cells in a non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient. PATIENT: Following simultaneous RCT (64.8 Gy), a patient with inoperable NSCLC (cT4, cN3, cM0, stage IIIb) was treated with 4 cycles of autologous ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated NK cells and the PD-1 antibody nivolumab as a second-line therapy. Blood samples were taken for immunophenotyping during the course of therapy. RESULTS: Adoptive transfer of ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated NK cells after RCT combined with PD-1 blockade is well tolerated and results in superior overall survival (OS). No viable tumor cells but a massive immune cell infiltration in fibrotic tissue was detected after therapy. Neither tumor progression nor distant metastases were detectable by CT scanning 33 months after diagnosis. Therapy response was associated with significantly increased CD3-/NKG2D+/CD94+ NK cell counts, elevated CD8+ to CD4+ T cell and CD3-/CD56bright to CD3-/CD56dim NK cell ratios, and significantly reduced regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: A combined therapy consisting of RCT, mHsp70-targeting NK cells, and PD-1 antibody inhibition is well tolerated, induces anti-tumor immunity, and results in long-term tumor control in one patient with advanced NSCLC. Further, randomized studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this combination therapy.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Mar 19.,"Radiotherapy is an independent prognostic marker of favorable prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer patients after treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab.","BACKGROUND: It remains unclear why radiation clinically provides a synergistic effect when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate whether the therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab is improved as a result of a history of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: From February 2016 to December 2017, 124 consecutive patients were administered nivolumab for pretreated advanced NSCLC. The patients were divided into RT and non-RT groups. RESULTS: Sixty-six (53%) of the 124 patients had been administered RT before the initiation of nivolumab, 52 (42%) received extracranial RT, and 40 (32%) were treated with thoracic RT. The median number of nivolumab cycles was 4 (range: 1-43). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of nivolumab in all patients were 28.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The ORR (36.4%) was significantly higher in patients who had received previous RT than in patients who had not received any RT (19%). The therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab was particularly noteworthy in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma histology administered extracranial RT, with ORRs of 48.3% and 52.6%, and DCRs of 87.1% and 84.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Previous RT was an independent prognostic marker of favorable prognosis after nivolumab administration and improved the response rate to nivolumab treatment. Previous RT was clinically identified to have a synergistic effect with nivolumab treatment, increasing the response rate and improving the outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: We analyzed the data of 26 patients who underwent treatment with EGFR-TKIs immediately before and/or after the administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody. RESULTS: Four out of the 26 patients developed ILD during EGFR-TKI treatment: three patients during the administration of osimertinib immediately after, and one during afatinib immediately before treatment with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Three of 12 patients who underwent EGFR-TKI therapy immediately after anti-PD-1 antibody treatment experienced osimertinib-induced ILD. ILD was not observed in the five patients administered an anti-PD-1 antibody followed by first or second-generation EGFR-TKIs. CONCLUSION: ILD was observed in the treatment sequence of an anti-PD-1 antibody followed by osimertinib, but not with first or second-generation EGFR-TKIs.© 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2019 Feb 27.,Improved efficacy of ramucirumab plus docetaxel after nivolumab failure in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the chemotherapy response improves after exposure to immunotherapy. Antiangiogenic agents have been shown to stimulate the immune system and cause synergistic effects that stimulate tumor shrinkage. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate improvement of the efficacy of ramucirumab plus docetaxel after the failure of nivolumab as a PD-1 inhibitor. METHODS: From February 2016 to December 2017, 152 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) administered nivolumab in our institution were identified. We reviewed the records of 20 NSCLC patients administered ramucirumab plus docetaxel after nivolumab failure. The overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were investigated. Pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was prophylactically administered to 18 patients (90%) after the administration of ramucirumab plus docetaxel. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 70 (range: 55-77) years. Twelve patients were male and eight were female. The histology was adenocarcinoma in 16 patients, squamous cell carcinoma in three, and other in one. The ORR of ramucirumab plus docetaxel was 60%, and the PFS and OS were 169 and 343 days, respectively. Among the 20 patients, 12 achieved a partial response, giving an ORR of 60.0%. Six patients had stable disease and two had progressive disease. The disease control rate was 90%. Gastrointestinal adverse events were frequently observed in 19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ramucirumab plus docetaxel achieved a higher response rate when administered immediately after nivolumab failure compared to regimens without prior nivolumab administration.© 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with an anti-PD-1 antibody between December 2015 and March 2018 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan, was conducted. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with and without MPE. Additional survival analysis according to PD-L1 expression status was conducted. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients were identified before the commencement of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment: 33 with MPE and 219 without MPE. PFS and OS were significantly shorter in patients with MPE than in patients without MPE (median PFS 3.0 vs. 5.8 months, hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, P = 0.014; median OS 7.9 vs. 15.8 months, HR 2.1, P = 0.001). In patients with PD-L1 expression in ≥ 1% of their tumor cells, the PFS of patients with MPE was significantly shorter than of patients without MPE (median PFS 3.1 vs. 6.5 months, HR 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.0-3.5; P = 0.021). The presence of MPE was independently associated with a shorter PFS and OS in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The presence of MPE in patients administered an anti-PD-1 antibody is associated with shorter PFS and OS, regardless of the presence of PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% of tumor cells.© 2019 The Authors.

In the current immunotherapy era, it is often difficult to evaluate the therapeutic effect, disease progression, and pseudo-enlargement of the tumor or the emergence of another etiology. In the present report, we describe a 79-year-old patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) newly detected during nivolumab treatment for recurrent NSCLC. When the patient was 73 years old, he had suffered from NSCLC and received concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising cisplatin and docetaxel, achieving a complete response. Six years after the chemoradiotherapy, the patient had multiple lung and hepatic lesions. We thus started the treatment with nivolumab for recurrent NSCLC. All those lesions responded to nivolumab over nine cycles. By contrast, a lesion was newly detected in the medial segment of left hepatic lobe, liver segment 4 (S4), and was gradually getting larger, as judged by computed tomographic scan. Liver biopsy revealed the growing lesion to be a well-differentiated HCC. Consequently, the patient was treated with radiofrequency ablation to HCC, while nivolumab treatment was continued for NSCLC. Immunohistochemical analysis of the HCC specimens revealed nuclear accumulation of β-catenin compared with normal liver cells and undetectable expression of program death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Such expression profiles of β-catenin and PD-L1 in HCC may be responsible for the resistance against nivolumab treatment. Immunohistochemical features of the biopsy specimens may be predictive of the effectiveness of the immunotherapy in HCC.",PD-L1,3

With the approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy for treatment-naïve, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, PD-L1 testing has to become broadly available in pathology laboratories. When PD-L1 testing started to be introduced in routine pathology practice, there were several open issues, which needed to be addressed in order to provide accurate results. This review will discuss the complex biological background of PD-L1 as predictive biomarker, summarize relevant clinical trials in NSCLC illustrating the origin of different PD-L1 expression cutoffs and scorings, and address issues important for PD-L1 testing including the analytical comparability of the different clinical trial-validated PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays, the potential of laboratory-developed tests, and an overview of the different scoring algorithms.",PD-L1,3

These patients are often treated with palliative radiotherapy (PRT); however, data evaluating the combination of PRT and ICB in patients with vertebral metastases is limited. Furthermore, patients with cord compression are generally excluded from prospective clinical trials. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated outcomes following PRT and PD-1 inhibition in patients with vertebral metastases. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 37 consecutive patients (total 57 lesions) treated with radiation for vertebral metastases who also received PD-1 inhibition. Patient, treatment and outcomes data were abstracted from the medical records. Results: Histologies included non-small cell lung cancer (n = 21), renal cell carcinoma (n = 9) and melanoma (n = 7). Out of 57 lesions,18 involved >1 segments of the vertebral column. There were isolated lesions in thoracic (16), lumbar (9), cervical (6), and sacral (8) vertebrae. Presenting symptoms included pain (19), numbness (10), and weakness (3). Eleven patients were asymptomatic. Radiologic cord compression was present in 12, epidural extension in 28 and compression fracture in 14. Eleven patients underwent surgical decompression prior to the onset of RT. Median radiation dose was 24 Gy (range 8-30 Gy). Stereotactic radiation was delivered in 4 patients; 33 patients received conformal RT. 21 patients received PD-1 inhibition after RT, 9 before RT and 7 with RT. Seven patients received concurrent CTLA-4 inhibitors with anti-PD-1 therapy. Treatment was in general well-tolerated. Toxicities included fatigue (6), transient pain flare (1), nausea/vomiting (1) and G1 skin changes (1). All patients reported some degree of pain relief. Numbness/weakness was improved in 6 of 13 patients with baseline symptoms (46%) and this was more likely in patients that received vertebral radiation after starting PD-1 inhibitors (71 vs. 17%, p = 0.04). Most patients (22 of 33 evaluable patients, 67%) had stability of irradiated lesions on subsequent follow up imaging performed at median of 30 days from RT, whereas 3 had a complete local response and 4 had a partial local response. Conclusions: We demonstrate that PRT administered to vertebral metastases was well-tolerated and effective in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. There was an encouraging rate of pain reduction and neurological improvement.",PD-L1,3

Combining these immunotherapies with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment has resulted in improved response rates and increased survival when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Certain patient populations may even benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in the first-line setting. The PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is approved as monotherapy or in combination with platinum + pemetrexed for most newly diagnosed patients with metastatic NSCLC, excluding those with a targetable oncogene such as ALK and EGFR. The PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab is also approved in combination with bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for the same population, with some parts of the world also approving this regimen for patients with ALK rearrangements or EGFR activating mutations. However, there are many other chemo-immunotherapy regimens that have been evaluated as initial treatment in metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, combinations of PD-1 axis inhibitors with cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 inhibitors have been examined, although none are yet approved. Here we review the clinical data in support of the current first-line approaches across histologies and biomarker subtypes, as well as highlight future research directions revealed by the current data.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Relationship Between Prior Radiotherapy and Checkpoint-Inhibitor Pneumonitis in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between radiotherapy (RT), in particular chest RT, and development of immune-related (IR) pneumonitis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2011 and July 2017, NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 at a tertiary-care academic cancer center were identified. Patient, treatment, prior RT (intent, technique, timing, courses), and IR pneumonitis details were collected. Treating investigators diagnosed IR pneumonitis clinically. Diagnostic IR pneumonitis scans were overlaid with available chest RT plans to describe IR pneumonitis in relation to prior chest RT. We evaluated associations between patient, treatment, RT details, and development of IR pneumonitis by Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Of the 188 NSCLC patients we identified, median follow-up was 6.78 (range, 0.30-79.3) months and median age 66 (range, 39-91) years; 54% (n = 102) were male; and 42% (n = 79) had stage I-III NSCLC at initial diagnosis. Patients received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy (n = 127, 68%) or PD-1/PD-L1-based combinations (n = 61, 32%). In the entire cohort, 70% (132/188) received any RT, 53% (100/188) chest RT, and 37% (70/188) curative-intent chest RT. Any grade IR pneumonitis occurred in 19% (36/188; 95% confidence interval, 13.8-25.6). Of those who developed IR pneumonitis and received chest RT (n = 19), patients were more likely to have received curative-intent versus palliative-intent chest RT (17/19, 89%, vs. 2/19, 11%; P = .051). Predominant IR pneumonitis appearances were ground-glass opacities outside high-dose chest RT regions. CONCLUSION: No RT parameter was significantly associated with IR pneumonitis. On subset analysis of patients who developed IR pneumonitis and who had received prior chest RT, IR pneumonitis was more common in patients who received curative-intent chest RT. Attention should be paid to NSCLC patients receiving curative-intent RT followed by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents.",PD-L1,3

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase I/Ib study treated PD-L1/PD-1-naive patients with solid tumors in a dose-escalation stage and then in multiple, indication-specific dose-expansion cohorts. In most patients, cobimetinib was dosed once daily orally for 21 days on, 7 days off. Atezolizumab was dosed at 800 mg intravenously every 2 weeks. The primary objectives were safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included ORR, PFS and OS. RESULTS: Between 27 December 2013 and 9 May 2016, 152 patients were enrolled. As of 4 September 2017, 150 patients received ≥ 1 dose of atezolizumab, including 14 in the dose-escalation cohorts and 136 in the dose-expansion cohorts. Patients had mCRC (n = 84), melanoma (n = 22), NSCLC (n = 28), and other solid tumors (n = 16). The most common all-grade treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (67%), rash (48%) and fatigue (40%), similar to those with single-agent cobimetinib and atezolizumab. One (< 1%) treatment-related grade 5 AE occurred (sepsis). Forty-five (30%) and 23 patients (15%) had AEs that led to discontinuation of cobimetinib and atezolizumab, respectively. Confirmed responses were observed in 7 of 84 patients (8%) with mCRC (6 responders were microsatellite low/stable, 1 was microsatellite instable), 9 of 22 patients (41%) with melanoma, and 5 of 28 patients (18%) with NSCLC. Clinical activity was independent of KRAS/BRAF status across diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab plus cobimetinib had manageable safety and clinical activity irrespective of KRAS/BRAF status. Although potential synergistic activity was seen in mCRC, this was not confirmed in a subsequent phase III study.© The Author 2019.

Epub 2019 Mar 4.,Surgical Tumor-Derived Personalized Photothermal Vaccine Formulation for Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Personalized cancer vaccines show great potential in cancer immunotherapy by inducing an effective and durable antitumor response. However, the limitation of neoantigen identification, low immunogenicity, and weak immune response hamper the development of personalized cancer vaccines. The surgically removed tumor contains tumor antigens specific to the patient, which provides a promising source for personalized cancer vaccines. Here, we utilized the surgically removed tumor to prepare a personalized photothermal vaccine combined with the PD-1 checkpoint blockade antibody to prevent tumor relapse and metastasis. Black phosphorus quantum dot nanovesicles (BPQD-CCNVs) coated with surgically removed tumor cell membrane were prepared and loaded into a thermosensitive hydrogel containing GM-CSF and LPS. The sustained release of GM-CSF from the hypodermic injection of Gel-BPQD-CCNVs effectively recruited dendritic cells to capture tumor antigen. NIR irradiation and LPS stimulated the expansion and activation of DCs, which then traveled to the lymph nodes to present antigen to CD8+ T cells. Moreover, the combination with PD-1 antibody significantly enhanced tumor-specific CD8+ T cell elimination of the surgical residual and lung metastatic tumor. Hence, our work may provide a promising strategy for the clinical development of a personalized cancer vaccine.",PD-L1,3

In this review, we summarize results from recent clinical trials that have evaluated the anti-PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab and the anti-PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab and durvalumab as first-line treatment as monotherapy, in combination with chemotherapy, other immunotherapies, and anti-angiogenesis agents. We discuss factors that may influence treatment selection, including patient baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, tumor histology, and biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden. While immunotherapy has become a central component of first-line treatment for most patients with advanced NSCLC, important questions remain about how treatment should be managed for individual patients.© The Author 2019.

[Epub ahead of print],Heterogeneous Expression of Programmed Death Receptor-ligand 1 on Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients With Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Blockade of the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) pathway is effective against solid tumors including lung cancer. PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor tissue serves as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of PD-1 pathway blockade. Here, we evaluated the expression of PD-L1 on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral whole blood (3 mL) was collected from patients, and CTCs and PD-L1 expression were detected using a microcavity array (MCA) system. Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 detection was also performed using matched tumor tissues. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with lung cancer were enrolled in the study between July 2015 and April 2016 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital. The characteristics of the patients were as follows: median age, 71 years (range, 39-86 years); male, 72%; stage II to III/IV, 14%/85%; non-small-cell lung cancer/small-cell lung cancer/other, 73%/21%/6%. CTCs were detected in 66 of 67 patients (median, 19; range, 0-115), and more than 5 CTCs were detected in 78% of patients. PD-L1-expressing CTCs were detected in 73% of patients, and the proportion score of PD-L1-expressing CTCs ranged from 3% to 100%, suggesting intra-patient heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression on CTCs. Tumor tissues were available from 27 patients and were immunostained for PD-L1, and no correlation was observed between tumor tissues and CTCs based on the proportion score (R2 = 0.0103). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression was detectable on CTCs in patients with lung cancer, and intra-patient heterogeneity was observed. No correlation was observed between PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues and CTCs.",PD-L1,3

The adverse effects of anti-PD-1 antibodies relating to autoimmunity are different from traditional chemotherapeutic drugs and may involve many organs including the endocrine system. We herein describe a case of adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency during the treatment of advanced small-cell lung cancer, probably caused by nivolumab-induced hypophysitis. The case showed nonspecific, insidious, as well as potentially life-threatening characters of immune-related adverse effects.

Among them, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have been granted US Food and Drug Administration approval for NSCLC. It is imperative to combine ICIs with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, antivascular therapy and targeted therapy. But in the bright future, there are two problems. One is how to use biomarkers to select the beneficiaries. The other is how to achieve a balance between drug effectiveness and safety. There are now seven drugs targeting the programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) pathways that have been or are expected to enter clinical treatment. This review focuses on these drugs and summarizes clinical trials that have been reported or that ongoing ones have already entered the recruiting state.© The Author(s) 2018.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the antitumor effects of a combined therapy consisting of ex vivo Hsp70-peptide TKD/IL-2-activated NK cells in combination with mouse/human anti-PD-1 antibody in a syngeneic glioblastoma and a xenograft lung cancer mouse model. Mice with membrane Hsp70 positive syngeneic GL261 glioblastoma or human xenograft A549 lung tumors were sham-treated with PBS or injected with ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated mouse/human NK cells and mouse/human PD-1 antibody either as a single regimen or in combination. Tumor volume was assessed by MR scanning and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T, NK, and PD-1+ cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We could show that the adoptive transfer of ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated mouse NK cells or the inhibition of PD-1 resulted in tumor growth delay and an improved overall survival (OS) in a syngeneic glioblastoma mouse model. A combination of both therapies was well-tolerated and significantly more effective with respect to both outcome parameters than either of the single regimens. A combined treatment in a xenograft lung cancer model showed identical effects in immunodeficient mice bearing human lung cancer after adoptive transfer of TKD/IL-2-activated human effector cells and a human PD-1 antibody. Tumor control was associated with a massive infiltration with CD8+ T and NK cells in both tumor models and a decreased in PD-1 expression on immune effector cells. In summary, a combined approach consisting of activated NK cells and anti-PD-1 therapy is safe and results in a long-term tumor control which is accompanied by a massive tumor immune cell infiltration in 2 preclinical tumor models.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Predicting Response to Cancer Immunotherapy using Non-invasive Radiomic Biomarkers.,"INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy is regarded one of the major breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds - urging the quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are related to and may therefore act as non-invasive radiomic biomarkers for immunotherapy response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We performed a AI-based characterization of each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and validate a non-invasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing between immunotherapy responding and non-responding. To define the biological basis of the radiographic biomarker, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis in an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients. RESULTS: The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to 0.83 AUC, p < 0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64 AUC, p = 0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level, immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both cancer types (p < 0.001), resulting in a one year survival difference of 24% (p = 0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and preferential response to immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions on standard-of-care imaging may function as non-invasive biomarkers for response to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.© The Author 2019.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether lycopene could promote the effect of anti-PD-1 treatment on lung cancer. Methods: Tumor formation assay was conducted. Immune reactions were assessed by detecting several cytokine levels using enzyme-like immunosorbent assay. T cell activity was analyzed using cytometry. The mechanism of lycopene action was investigated using Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing analysis. Results: After the mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were sacrificed, we found that combined lycopene and anti-PD-1 reduced the tumor volume and weight compared to control treatment. Cell apoptosis in the tumor tissues was significantly enhanced in mice with combined lycopene and anti-PD-1 treatment in comparison with those of either lycopene or anti-PD-1 alone. Furthermore, lycopene could assist anti-PD-1 to elevate the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 and interferon (IFN) γ while reduce the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in the spleen of mice injected with LLC cells. Lycopene treatment increased the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the spleen and promoted IFNγ-expressing CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Upon IFNγ stimulation, lycopene diminished PD-L1 expression via activating JAK and repressing phosphorylation of AKT. Conclusion: Our results have demonstrated that lycopene could be used as a potential adjuvant drug to synergistically improve the efficiency of anti-PD-1 therapy.",PD-L1,3

N-803, formerly ALT-803, is an IL-15 superagonist mutant and dimeric IL-15RαSushi-Fc fusion protein complex that enhances CD8+ T and NK cell expansion and function and exhibits anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical models. Previous in vitro studies have shown that IL-15 increases PD-L1 expression, a negative regulator of CD8+ T and NK cell function. Most reported preclinical studies administered N-803 intraperitoneally not subcutaneously, the current clinical route of administration. N-803 is now being evaluated clinically in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. However, the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Here, we examined the anti-tumor efficacy and immunomodulatory effects of combining N-803 with an anti-PD-L1 antibody in preclinical models of solid carcinomas refractory to anti-PD-L1 or N-803. METHODS: Subcutaneous N-803 and an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody were administered as monotherapy or in combination to 4T1 triple negative breast and MC38-CEA colon tumor-bearing mice. Anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated, and a comprehensive analysis of the immune-mediated effects of each therapy was performed on the primary tumor, lung as a site of metastasis, and spleen. RESULTS: We demonstrate that N-803 treatment increased PD-L1 expression on immune cells in vivo, supporting the combination of N-803 and anti-PD-L1. N-803 plus anti-PD-L1 was well-tolerated, reduced 4T1 lung metastasis and MC38-CEA tumor burden, and increased survival as compared to N-803 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies. Efficacy of the combination therapy was dependent on both CD8+ T and NK cells and was associated with increased numbers of these activated immune cells in the lung and spleen. Most alterations to NK and CD8+ T cell phenotype and number were driven by N-803. However, the addition of anti-PD-L1 to N-803 significantly enhanced CD8+ T cell effector function versus N-803 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies, as indicated by increased Granzyme B and IFNγ production, at the site of metastasis and in the periphery. Increased CD8+ T cell effector function correlated with higher serum IFNγ levels, without related toxicities, and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of the N-803 plus anti-PD-L1 combination versus either monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel insight into the mechanism of action of N-803 plus anti-PD-L1 combination and offer preclinical proof of concept supporting clinical use of N-803 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, including for patients non- and/or minimally responsive to either monotherapy.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Jan 9.,Improving cancer-specific outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients: Where to begin?,"In an article published in this issue of Cancer, DArcy et al link the incidence of cancer among recipients of solid organ transplantation (SOT) in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients with data from regional and statewide cancer registries to examine cancer-specific mortality for common malignancies in SOT recipients. This analysis helps to illuminate the role of immune surveillance across a broad range of malignancies and compares the incidence of cancers due to virally mediated oncogenesis (lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the aerodigestive epithelium, and hepatitis-induced liver cancer) with the incidence of other malignancies. The authors central finding is that cancer-specific mortality is significantly increased in SOT recipients in comparison with nontransplant recipients for multiple cancers, and the increased cancer incidence is not limited to the effects of viral oncogenesis. The authors document a significant increase in common epithelial malignancies that are currently treated with immune checkpoint antibodies, including melanoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the oral cavity/pharynx, kidney cancer, and lung cancer, and this supports the hypothesis that post-SOT immunosuppression affects immune surveillance in these cancers. Provocatively, the authors also document increases in the incidence and mortality of cancers not typically responsive to immune checkpoint therapies, including breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. The findings of DArcy et al suggest that immune surveillance controls oncogenesis and tumor progression in a broad range of malignancies and that breast cancer and pancreatic cancer could be sensitive to drugs targeting immune surveillance pathways other than those treated with currently Food and Drug Administration-approved antibodies to CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1.© 2019 American Cancer Society.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 12.,Dynamics of Tumor and Immune Responses during Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Despite the initial successes of immunotherapy, there is an urgent clinical need for molecular assays that identify patients more likely to respond. Here, we report that ultrasensitive measures of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and T-cell expansion can be used to assess responses to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic lung cancer patients (N = 24). Patients with clinical response to therapy had a complete reduction in ctDNA levels after initiation of therapy, whereas nonresponders had no significant changes or an increase in ctDNA levels. Patients with initial response followed by acquired resistance to therapy had an initial drop followed by recrudescence in ctDNA levels. Patients without a molecular response had shorter progression-free and overall survival compared with molecular responders [5.2 vs. 14.5 and 8.4 vs. 18.7 months; HR 5.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.57-18.35; P = 0.007 and HR 6.91; 95% CI, 1.37-34.97; P = 0.02, respectively], which was detected on average 8.7 weeks earlier and was more predictive of clinical benefit than CT imaging. Expansion of T cells, measured through increases of T-cell receptor productive frequencies, mirrored ctDNA reduction in response to therapy. We validated this approach in an independent cohort of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (N = 14), where the therapeutic effect was measured by pathologic assessment of residual tumor after anti-PD1 therapy. Consistent with our initial findings, early ctDNA dynamics predicted pathologic response to immune checkpoint blockade. These analyses provide an approach for rapid determination of therapeutic outcomes for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and have important implications for the development of personalized immune targeted strategies.Significance: Rapid and sensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA dynamic changes and T-cell expansion can be used to guide immune targeted therapy for patients with lung cancer.See related commentary by Zou and Meyerson, p. 1038.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Safety of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine in Cancer Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI).,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are at a higher risk for developing influenza (flu) related complications. It is unclear if the flu vaccine exacerbates immune events in patients treated with ICIs. METHODS: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective review of advanced cancer patients on ICIs who received the flu vaccine during three consecutive seasons; 2014-15, 15-16, and 16-17. The primary outcome assessed was any new onset immune-related adverse event (IRAE). A subset analysis of vaccinated patients newly treated with anti PD-1 agents (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) was conducted to assess overall IRAE rates for comparison with published clinical trials. RESULTS: During the three seasons, 370 patients met criteria for ICI and vaccination within ~ two months (65 days). The most common underlying cancers were lung (46%) and melanoma (19%); 61% of patients received anti PD-1 agent only. In the entire cohort, 20% experienced an IRAE (any grade); incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity was 8%. No grade 5 events occurred. In the subset of 170 patients newly treated with anti PD-1 agents, overall IRAE rate was 18%, grade 3/4 events occurred in 7.6%. Influenza was diagnosed in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: No increase in incidence or severity of IRAE was detected in patients on ICIs who received the inactivated influenza vaccine within ~ 2 months of ICI. For newly treated patients on anti-PDI agents, IRAE rates were comparable to published clinical trials and did not vary with order of administration.

The use of next generation sequencing (NGS) may help in identification of germline mutations in genes involved in a common etiology for both tumors thus allowing a common effective therapeutic strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the unexpected positive results obtained in a young woman with relapsed chemo-resistant stage IVB cervical and synchronous stage IV lung cancer, who underwent an interdisciplinary approach including palliative surgery with laparoscopic total pelvic exenteratio followed by a chemo-immunotherapy protocol with the anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1 antibody nivolumab plus metronomic cyclophosphamide. The treatment choice was based on tumor PD-Ligand 1 assessment and NGS analysis for the identification of potential treatment targets. Outcomes included tumor objective response and patient-centered outcomes (pain, performance status and overall quality of life). RESULTS: Laparoscopic surgery obtained an immediate symptom control and allowed the early start of medical treatment. One month after combined therapy start the patient achieved a significant improvement in performance status, pain, overall Quality of life and after 3 months she resumed working. After 3 and 6 months of treatment we observed an objective dimensional and metabolic response. Currently, after 24 months (and 48 cycles of nivolumab) the patient is continuing to benefit from treatment: she is in complete remission, with good performance status and she is working and leading a self-dependent life. CONCLUSION: Our study strongly affirms the efficacy of an interdisciplinary approach including surgical and innovative medical strategies based on immunotherapy in patients with advanced chemo-resistant synchronous cervical and lung cancer.

The medical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were obtained from the outpatient department or inpatient department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from August 1, 2015, to January 1, 2018. Our follow-up continued until May 1,2018. We chose overall survival (OS) as the primary observation endpoint and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety as the secondary observation endpoints. Efficacy was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and we compared the influence of different factors on PFS and OS by the log-rank test. The median follow-up time was 11 months. At the end of the follow-up, 24 patients (61.5%) were still undergoing immunotherapy, and 7 patients (17.9%) had died. Twenty-six cases (66.7%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line treatment, and 7 cases (17.9%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as second-line treatment. Only 6 cases (15.4%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as third-line treatment. Therapeutic effect evaluation: Complete response (CR): 1 case (2.6%). Partial response (PR): 10 cases (25.6%). Stable disease (SD): 16 cases (41.0%). Progressive disease (PD): 12 cases (30.8%). The ORR was 28.2%, and DCR was 69.2%. The median PFS was 25.5 months (95% CI 6.8-44.1 months), which failed to reach the median OS. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in a real-world setting than in clinical trials; PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for people who are over 70 than for people who are under 70. Additionally, patients who are over 75 years old have a higher response rate, suggesting that elderly patients may receive more benefits from immunotherapy; Patients who have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (+) may benefit from immunotherapy after treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is essential to identify these potential patients from the entire patient pool; PD-1 may have a certain curative effect on brain metastases from NSCLC. Local radiotherapy may help to improve PD-1 intracranial efficacy.",PD-L1,3

We have previously shown that adoptive transfer of double negative T (DNT) cells expanded from healthy donors can target leukemia but their role in treating established lung cancer is not clear. Here we explore the role of human DNT cells in targeting late-stage established lung cancer either alone or in combination with Nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) and describe underlying mechanisms. METHODS: DNT cells from resected lung cancer tissue of patients were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine their infiltration and PD-1 expression. Expansion capacity and anti-tumor function of lung cancer patient and healthy donor DNT cells were compared. Late-stage lung cancer xenograft models were developed to determine the anti-tumor effect of DNT cells alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, and the level of tumor-infiltrating DNT cells was quantified by histology and characterized by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Patient-derived tumor infiltrating lymphocytes contained a lower frequency of DNT cells with a higher expression of PD-1 relative to normal lung tissue. Ex vivo expanded patient- and healthy donor-derived DNT cells showed similar levels of cytotoxicity against lung cancer cells in vitro. Healthy donor-derived DNT cells significantly inhibited the growth of late-stage lung cancer xenografts, which was further augmented by anti-PD-1 through increased DNT cell tumor infiltration. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of DNT cells for adoptive cellular therapy against lung cancer either alone or in combination with anti-PD-1.",PD-L1,3

Here we report that cigarette smoke and the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induce PD-L1 expression on lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, which is mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Anti-PD-L1 antibody or deficiency in AhR significantly suppresses BaP-induced lung cancer. In 37 patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab, 13/16 (81.3%) patients who achieve partial response or stable disease express high levels of AhR, whereas 12/16 (75%) patients with progression disease exhibit low levels of AhR in tumor tissues. AhR inhibitors exert significant antitumor activity and synergize with anti-PD-L1 antibody in lung cancer mouse models. These results demonstrate that tobacco smoke enables lung epithelial cells to escape from adaptive immunity to promote tumorigenesis, and AhR predicts the response to immunotherapy and represents an attractive therapeutic target.",PD-L1,3

Based on the correlation of programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) and EGFR signaling pathway, whether continuous TKIs treatment will affect PD-L1 expression after disease progression remains unclear. To investigate the potential change of PD-L1 expression in TKI-resistant NSCLC after continuous TKIs treatment, we treated H1975 and HCC827 for more than one month and explored the possible effect on immune cells as well as underlying biological mechanisms. We found that continuous exposure to TKIs induced upregulation of PD-L1 in H1975 and HCC827. Moreover, PD-L1 upregulation significantly inhibited proliferation and slightly promoted apoptosis of T cells. We observed the activation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 along with the PD-L1 upregulation. With the pathway inhibitors, we found ERK1/2 pathway involved in inducing PD-L1 in resistant lung cancer. This study provides preclinical evidence that continuous TKIs treatment may induce PD-L1 expression in resistant NSCLC, resulting in the suppression of T cell function and immune escape. ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors, PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors or combination strategies should be considered to reverse the resistance to TKIs in NSCLC patients.",PD-L1,3

Nearly all organs can be affected by immune-related toxicities. However, the most frequently reported are: fatigue, rash, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, arthralgia, decreased appetite and abdominal pain. Although these adverse events are usually mild, reversible and not frequent, an early diagnosis is crucial. Immune-related pulmonary toxicity was most frequently observed in trials of lung cancer and of melanoma patients treated with the combination of the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 and the anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies. The most frequent immune-related adverse event in the lung is represented by pneumonitis due to the development of infiltrates in the interstitium and in the alveoli. Clinical symptoms and radiological patterns are the key elements to be considered for an early diagnosis, rendering the differential diagnosis crucial. Diagnosis of immune-related pneumonitis may imply the temporary or definitive suspension of immunotherapy, along with the start of immuno-suppressive treatments. The aim of this work is to summarize the biological bases, clinical and radiological findings of lung toxicity under immune checkpoint blockade, underlining the importance of multidisciplinary teams for an optimal early diagnosis of this side effect, with the aim to reach an improved patient care.",PD-L1,3

Hence, we investigated whether the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) predicted anti-PD1 treatment response for advanced NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively identified 47 patients with NSCLC treated with anti-PD1 and assessed the prognostic value of the GPS. The GPS was calculated using C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations 1 month after starting anti-PD1 treatment. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine differences in progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival, and clinical response. RESULTS: The post-treatment GPS independently predicted anti-PD1 treatment efficacy, as a good post-treatment GPS (GPS 0-1) was significantly associated with improved PFS. Intra-treatment GPS change was associated with clinical response. CONCLUSION: The post-treatment GPS independently predicted efficacy of anti-PD1 treatment for NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

And it has no FDA-approved therapy. ShenQi FuZheng Injection (SFI) is clinically used for adjuvant treatment of lung cancer and gastric cancer. And we found that SFI can improve the incidence of CRF in patients with gastric cancer. However, its efficacy against CRF remains to be elucidated. In the present study we established a tumor-bearing mouse fatigue model, conducted the forced swim test (FST) and grip strength measurements to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SFI. Additionally, we detected inflammation and immune indicators. The result showed that SFI administration could reduce depressive-like behaviors in tumor-bearing mice and inhibit tumor growth. In addition, SFI might improve fatigue symptoms by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by peripheral immune cells, restrain the dysfunction of exhausted T cells and improve the anti-tumor immunity through the targets of PDL1, TIM3 and FOXP3. These data suggested that SFI might be useful in alleviating CRF and provide further support to confirm SFI as a potential therapy for CRF in humans.",PD-L1,3

METHODS: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer in a phase 1 trial. The associations between candidate biomarkers (programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression, mismatch repair status, tumor mutation load, and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels) and the efficacy of SHR-1210 were also explored. RESULTS: Thirty patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma who were refractory or intolerant to previous chemotherapy were enrolled between June 2, 2016, and June 8, 2017. Seven patients (23.3%) demonstrated objective responses, including 1 complete response. The objective response rates for patients with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors were 23.1% (3 of 13) and 26.7% (4 of 15), respectively (P = 1.000). Two treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported: one was grade 3 pruritus, and the other (3.3%) was grade 5 interstitial lung disease. All 20 patients tested for the mismatch repair status had mismatch repair-proficient tumors, and the response rate was 30.0% (95% confidence interval, 11.9%-54.3%). Patients with a higher mutation load (4 of 10) tended to have better responses than those with fewer mutations (2 of 10), but the difference was not significant (P = .628). Patients with a >10% relative increase from the baseline LDH level were more likely to experience disease progression (90% [9 of 10]) than patients with a ≤10% change (40% [8 of 20]; P = .017).

Additionally, metformin has been linked to favorable outcomes in tumors. Many researchers have reported immune-mediated adverse events induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) single agent. However, little is documented on the adverse events of the combined use of ICI and metformin. METHODS: To address this question, we used the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to display the landscape of adverse events associated with the combined use of ICI and metformin. We identified 38 adverse event cases about the combination treatment between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2018. RESULTS: There are 36 cases in patients receiving nivolumab plus metformin (NM) therapy, and the other 2 cases were pembrolizumab plus metformin (PM). Among the 36 patients receiving NM therapy, the most common indication was for treatment of malignant lung cancer (20, 55.56%), Notably, 9 cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and diarrhea were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that higher risk of IBD might occur in lung cancer patients during the combined therapy of nivolumab plus metformin.

Despite the variable definition of PD-L1 positivity in tumors, an association between expression and response has been reasonably consistent in advanced NSCLC. In addition, the clinical efficacy of ICIs seems to be related to the genomic landscape of the tumor in terms of mutational burden and clonal neoantigens. Furthermore, increasing evidence shows that excessive activation of the immune response elicited by ICIs, leading to immune-related toxicities, might be associated with an improved response to immunotherapy. There are still many unanswered questions about the proper use of these agents to maximize their efficacy, which may be improved through combination with radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, or other immune mediators, including dual checkpoint blockade. To search for clues for addressing these challenges, this review focused on the characteristics and clinical features of long-term NSCLC survivors and the potential biomarkers of response to ICIs.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 18.,A secreted PD-L1 splice variant that covalently dimerizes and mediates immunosuppression.,"Targeting immune checkpoint pathways, such as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1, also known as CD274 or B7-H1) or its receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) has shown improved survival for patients with numerous types of cancers, not limited to lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. PD-L1 is a co-inhibitory molecule whose expression on the surface of tumor cells is associated with worse prognosis in many tumors. Here we describe a splice variant (secPD-L1) that does not splice into the transmembrane domain, but instead produces a secreted form of PD-L1 that has a unique 18 amino acid tail containing a cysteine that allows it to homodimerize and more effectively inhibit lymphocyte function than monomeric soluble PD-L1. We show that recombinant secPD-L1 can dimerize and inhibit T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production in vitro. The secPD-L1 variant is expressed by malignant cells in vitro that also express high levels of full-length PD-L1. Transcriptomic analysis of gene expression across The Cancer Genome Atlas found the strongest association of secPD-L1 with full-length PD-L1, but also with subsets of immunologic genes, such as in myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, the splice variant is also expressed in normal tissues and within normal peripheral blood cells it is preferentially expressed in activated myeloid cells. This is the first report of a form of secreted PD-L1 that homodimerizes and is functionally active. SecPD-L1 may function as a paracrine negative immune regulator within the tumor, since secPD-L1 does not require a cell-to-cell interaction to mediate its inhibitory effect.",PD-L1,3

However, only a subset of patients respond to this treatment, warranting a greater understanding of the biological mechanisms driving immune evasion via PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and other T-cell suppressive pathways. We previously identified a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with human papillomavirus integration in the PD-L1 locus upstream of the transmembrane domain-encoding region, suggesting expression of a truncated form of PD-L1 (Parfenov et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111(43):15544-15549, 2014). In this study, we extended this observation by performing a computational analysis of 33 other cancer types as well as human cancer cell lines, and identified additional PD-L1 isoforms with an exon 4 enrichment expressed in 20 cancers and human cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that cancer cell lines with high expression levels of exon 4-enriched PD-L1 generate a secreted form of PD-L1. Further biochemical studies of exon 4-enriched PD-L1 demonstrated that this form is secreted and maintains the capacity to bind PD-1 as well as to serve as a negative regulator on T cell function, as measured by inhibition of IL-2 and IFNg secretion. Overall, we have demonstrated that truncated forms of PD-L1 exist in numerous cancer types, and have validated that truncated PD-L1 can be secreted and negatively regulate T cell function.",PD-L1,3

Improvements are obtained with IL2/anti-IL2 complexes (IL2Cx), which redirect IL2 action to CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of combining IL2Cx with blockade of inhibitory immune pathways. In an autochthonous lung adenocarcinoma model, we show that the IL2Cx/anti-PD-1 combination increases CD8+ T-cell infiltration of the lung and controls tumor growth. In the B16-OVA model, which is resistant to checkpoint inhibition, combination of IL2Cx with PD-1 or CTLA-4 pathway blockade reverses that resistance. Both combinations work by reinvigorating exhausted intratumoral CD8+ T cells and by increasing the breadth of tumor-specific T-cell responses. However, only the IL2Cx/anti-CTLA-4 combination is able to rescue NK cell antitumor function by modulating intratumoral regulatory T cells. Overall, association of IL2Cx with PD-1 or CTLA-4 pathway blockade acts by different cellular mechanisms, paving the way for the rational design of combinatorial antitumor therapies.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

We report safety and efficacy results from the phase 1b KEYNOTE-025 study, which evaluated pembrolizumab in Japanese patients with previously treated NSCLC. Eligible patients had histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥1% and had received ≥1 platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Patients received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 2 years or until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were to evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥1% and the objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST version 1.1 in patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled and received ≥1 pembrolizumab dose. The median (range) age was 66.0 (41-78) years, and 61% had received ≥2 prior systemic therapies. Eleven patients (29%) experienced grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (AE); 9 patients (24%) experienced immune-mediated AE and infusion reactions, with pneumonitis (11%; any grade) being most common. Among evaluable patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% (n = 11), ORR was 27% (95% CI, 6-61). Among evaluable patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥1% (n = 37), ORR was 22% (95% CI, 10-38). Median (95% CI) progression-free survival and OS were 3.9 (2.0-6.2) months and 19.2 (8.0-26.7) months, respectively.

The increasing use of programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer and in other malignancies means clinicians have to face up to new challenges in managing immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which often resemble autoimmune diseases. Neurological irAEs represent an emerging toxicity related to immunotherapy, and it is mandatory to know how to monitor, recognize, and manage them, since they can rapidly lead to patient death if untreated. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of these irAEs have been recently published but sharing some of the most unusual clinical cases is crucial, in our opinion, to improve awareness and to optimize the approach for these patients. A literature review on the diagnosis and treatment of immune-related neurotoxicitys has been conducted starting from the report of four cases of neurological irAEs regarding cases of polyneuropathy, myasthenia gravis, Bells palsy, and encephalopathy, all of which occurred in oncological patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) for the treatment of non-oncogene addicted advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profile of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was explored in a dataset of 16,000 samples, including approximately 4,000 metastatic tumors, across >25 tumor types prevalent in the United States, looking for new indications for the programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab. PD-L1 expression was highly concordant with several genomic signatures indicative of immune-inflamed tumor microenvironment. Prevalence of activated immune-inflamed tumors across all tumor types was explored and used to rank tumor types for potential response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. RESULTS: The analysis yielded 3 tiers of indications in which high levels of PD-L1 and immune-inflamed signatures were found in up to 40% to 60%, 20% to 40%, and 0% to 20% of tumors. Tier 1 contained novel indications known at the time of analysis to be responsive to PD-1 checkpoint blockade in the clinic (such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer), as well as indications not studied in the clinic previously, including microsatellite instability-high colorectal, head and neck, bladder, and triple-negative breast cancers. Complementary analysis of an Asian/Pacific cancer dataset (gastric cancer) revealed high prevalence of immune-inflamed tumors in gastric cancer. These data contributed to prioritization of these indications for clinical development of pembrolizumab as monotherapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TMB scores were determined retrospectively for 72 consecutive patients at our institution with next-generation sequencing comprehensive genomic profiling testing by Foundation Medicine. TMB scores were correlated with a number of clinical variables and presence of DNA repair mutations. Thirty-four patients were treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapies, and survival analyses based on TMB score were performed. In addition, tissue immunohistochemical analysis was performed for a subset of patients. RESULTS: History of smoking, but not other clinical variables, including prior treatment lines, stage of disease, and number of metastatic sites, predicted higher TMB score. Higher TMB score was significantly associated with greater number of DNA repair mutations. In the subset of patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade, higher TMB score significantly predicted overall survival, but not progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.10, P = .003; hazard ratio 1.1, P = .84, respectively). In a small subset of patients, PD-1/PD-L1 staining did not independently predict progression-free survival or overall survival.

Epub 2019 Apr 9.,YY1 regulates cancer cell immune resistance by modulating PD-L1 expression.,"Recent advances in the treatment of various cancers have resulted in the adaptation of several novel immunotherapeutic strategies. Notably, the recent intervention through immune checkpoint inhibitors has resulted in significant clinical responses and prolongation of survival in patients with several therapy-resistant cancers (melanoma, lung, bladder, etc.). This intervention was mediated by various antibodies directed against inhibitory receptors expressed on cytotoxic T-cells or against corresponding ligands expressed on tumor cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the clinical responses were only observed in a subset of the treated patients; it was not clear why the remaining patients did not respond to checkpoint inhibitor therapies. One hypothesis stated that the levels of PD-L1 expression correlated with poor clinical responses to cell-mediated anti-tumor immunotherapy. Hence, exploring the underlying mechanisms that regulate PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is one approach to target such mechanisms to reduce PD-L1 expression and, therefore, sensitize the resistant tumor cells to respond to PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treatments. Various investigations revealed that the overexpression of the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in most cancers is involved in the regulation of tumor cells resistance to cell-mediated immunotherapies. We, therefore, hypothesized that the role of YY1 in cancer immune resistance may be correlated with PD-L1 overexpression on cancer cells. This hypothesis was investigated and analysis of the reported literature revealed that several signaling crosstalk pathways exist between the regulations of both YY1 and PD-L1 expressions. Such pathways include p53, miR34a, STAT3, NF-kB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, c-Myc, and COX-2. Noteworthy, many clinical and pre-clinical drugs have been utilized to target these above pathways in various cancers independent of their roles in the regulation of PD-L1 expression. Therefore, the direct inhibition of YY1 and/or the use of the above targeted drugs in combination with checkpoint inhibitors should result in enhancing the cell-mediated anti-tumor cell response and also reverse the resistance observed with the use of checkpoint inhibitors alone.",PD-L1,3

Primary diagnoses were lung cancer (n = 77), melanoma (n = 8), head and neck carcinoma (n = 7), renal carcinoma (n = 5), Hodgkins lymphoma (n = 3), urothelial carcinoma (n = 3) and gallbladder adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma (n = 1 each). IrAEs were observed in 40 patients (37.7%). The most frequent irAEs were hypothyroidism (n = 15), nephritis (n = 5) and hyperthyroidism (n = 4). Objective response was observed in 44 patients (41.5%), and median PFS was 5.5 months (0.5-31 months). Thirty-three of the 40 patients with irAEs had objective response (82.5%) in contrast with 11 of the 66 cases without irAEs (16.6%) (OR 23.5, P < 0.000001). PFS in patients with irAEs was 10 months and 3 months in those without irAEs (HR 2.2, P = 0.016). OS in patients with irAEs was 32 months and 22 in those without irAEs, without statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: In advanced cancer treated with single-agent anti-PD-1 antibodies, patients with irAEs showed a markedly improved efficacy over patients without irAEs (ORR of 82.5% and PFS of 10 months vs ORR of 16.6% and PFS of 3 months). Future studies of anti-PD-1 immune-therapy should address this association to explore the underlying biological mechanisms of efficacy.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Nov 21.,A potential mechanism of the onset of acute eosinophilic pneumonia triggered by an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint antibody in a lung cancer patient.,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of immune checkpoint blockade on immunity in cancer patients is not completely elucidated due to the complexity of the immune network. Recent studies have revealed a significant role of programed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) in negatively controlling the production of CD4+ T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines and airway hypersensitiveness, suggesting hypo-responsive Th2 cells via the PD-1/PD-L2 inhibitory pathway in lung could be reawaken by PD-1 blockade therapy. METHODS: We describe the first report of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), which is known as Th2-associated pulmonary disease, triggered by nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in an advanced non-small cell lung cancer patient. Based on the current case report and literature, the present study proposes a potential mechanism of the onset of AEP as an immune-related adverse event (irAE). RESULTS: A 62-year-old man was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and nivolumab was selected as the third-line regimen. After three cycles of nivolumab treatment, chest computed tomography revealed pulmonary infiltrates in both lungs. The patient was diagnosed with AEP based on the diagnostic criteria for AEP. Nivolumab was suspended and the patient was started on oral prednisolone. His symptoms and radiological findings had rapidly improved. CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing frequency of the use of anti-PD-1 antibodies, clinicians should be aware of the risk of AEP as a potential irAE. This study may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying Th2-associated irAEs and AEP.© 2018 The Authors. Immunity, Inflammation and DiseasePublished by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,Association between soluble immune mediators and tumor responses in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer treated with anti-PD-1 inhibitor.,"Although programmed death (PD)-1 immune checkpoint therapies target the immune system, the relationship between inflammatory factors and the clinical outcome of anti-PD-1 therapy for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not fully understood. Here we examined the association between soluble immune mediators and the outcome of treatment with PD-1 inhibitors in patients with advanced/recurrent NSCLC. In two independent cohorts, we assessed the levels of 88 different soluble immune mediators in peripheral blood before and after anti-PD-1 treatment, and evaluated their associations with clinical outcomes. In the training cohort, the plasma levels of chitinase 3-like-1 and GM-CSF before treatment (p = 0.006 and p = 0.005, respectively) and changes in the plasma levels of CXCL2, VEGF, IFNα2, and MMP2 after treatment (p < 0.001, p = 0.019, p = 0.019, and p = 0.012, respectively) were significantly correlated with PFS. The change in the plasma CXCL2 level was also significantly associated with treatment-related AEs (p = 0.017). In the validation cohort, however, only the changes in the plasma levels of CXCL2 and MMP2 after treatment were associated with PFS (p = 0.003 and p = 0.006, respectively), and these changes were maintained during the course of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients who showed better clinical outcomes, even in those with tumor pseudoprogression. Since CXCL2 and MMP2 can be easily measured by minimally invasive blood sampling, they could be useful for monitoring of clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving PD-1 inhibitor therapy.© 2018 UICC.",PD-L1,3

A Lewis lung cancer animal model of C57BL/6 mice was established by transplanting Lewis lung cancer cells subcutaneously. The sPD-L1 protein was injected into the abdominal cavity of the mouse (sPD-L1 Ig) (working dose: 2.5, 5, 10 μg per mouse), while the sPD-L1 control protein was injected as a control. The growth of Lewis lung cancer xenografts was observed. On the 18th day after tumor cell inoculation, T lymphocyte subsets in mouse spleen were determined by flow cytometry. The PD-1 molecules on the surface of Lewis lung cancer cell line, C57BL/6 mouse spleen T lymphocytes and peripheral blood T lymphocytes were positively expressed. Compared with the control group, the volume of the transplanted tumor of Lewis lung cancer in C57BL/6 mice was larger with 10 μg sPD-L1 I g injection (P less than 0.05), and no significant difference was observed in tumor volume with 2.5 μg and 5 μg injection (P > 0.05). A certain level of soluble PD-L1 (10 μg/ mouse) could promote the growth of transplanted tumors of Lewis lung cancer in C57BL/6 mice.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2017 Oct 25.,Immune-related intestinal pseudo-obstruction associated with nivolumab treatment in a lung cancer patient.,"Immune checkpoint inhibition therapy using targeted monoclonal antibodies is a new therapeutic approach with significant survival benefit for patients with several cancer types. However, their use can be associated with unique immune-related adverse effects as a consequence of impaired self-tolerance due to loss of T-cell inhibition via a nonselective activation of the immune system. Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that was recently developed for cancer immunotherapy with remarkable responses in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients. We present a 62-year-old Caucasian male with recurrent lung adenocarcinoma and currently under third-line therapy with nivolumab, who was admitted in our hospital with abdominal distension. Radiologic findings were consistent with small bowel ileus. After four days of conservative treatment, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy where no cause of ileus was discovered. Postoperative the ileus persisted and considering that an adverse effect of the immune checkpoint inhibition therapy occurred, the patient received high-dose prednisone resulting in gradual improvement of symptoms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors may induce adverse effects to unaffected organ systems and tissues including the skin, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, and endocrine system. The mainstay treatment consists of immunosuppression with corticosteroids in the majority of cases. As the clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is expanding rapidly, there is an emergence of unique immune-related adverse effects in a growing patient population. Gaining early awareness is essential in these patients in order to ensure prompt diagnosis and management.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 27.,Inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR by Melafolone Improves Anti-PD-1 Therapy through Vascular Normalization and PD-L1 Downregulation in Lung Cancer.,"Checkpoint blockade therapy has been proven efficacious in lung cancer patients. However, primary/acquired resistance hampers its efficacy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to improve checkpoint blockade therapy. Here we tested whether dual inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by flavonoid melafolone improves program death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade therapy through normalizing tumor vasculature and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) downregulation. Virtual screening assay, cellular thermal shift assay, and enzyme inhibition assay identified melafolone as a potential inhibitor of COX-2 and EGFR. In Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and CMT167 models, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR by melafolone promoted survival, tumor growth inhibition, and vascular normalization, and ameliorated CD8+ T-cell suppression, accompanied by the downregulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and PD-L1 in the tumor cells. Mechanistically, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR in lung cancer cells by melafolone increased the migration of pericyte, decreased the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and enhanced the proliferation and effector function of CD8+ T cells through VEGF, TGF-β, or PD-L1 downregulation and PI3K/AKT inactivation. Notably, melafolone improved PD-1 immunotherapy against LLC and CMT167 tumors. Together, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR by melafolone improves checkpoint blockade therapy through vascular normalization and PD-L1 downregulation and, by affecting vessels and immune cells, may be a promising combination strategy for the treatment of human lung cancer.",PD-L1,3

Hypoxia-related genes are also important regulators of PD-L1, and the role of PD-L1 in NSCLC is still not clear. The objective of this study was to investigate PD-L1 expression and its correlation with hypoxic-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX) expression in NSCLC patients. The association between PD-L1 expression and survival was also determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PD-L1/protein expression was evaluated in 295 resected NSCLCs and its correlation with HIF1A, VEGFA, GLUT1, CAIX expression and survival was determined based on immunohistochemical and RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. RESULTS: PD-L1 protein expression was significantly correlated with HIF1A, VEGFA, GLUT1, and CAIX expression only in adenocarcinoma when a 10% or a 50% cut-off was used. PD-L1 mRNA expression was also significantly correlated with HIF1A, VEGFA, GLUT1, and CAIX expression in adenocarcinoma. Univariate analysis revealed that HIF1A expression was associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS), and GLUT1 was associated with poor overall survival (OS) and RFS. GLUT1 was an independent prognostic factor for OS in multivariate analysis of immunohistochemical and TCGA data (p = 0.024 and 0.029, respectively). Patients with low expression of both PD-L1 and GLUT1 had longer OS than other patterns in immunohistochemical and TCGA data (p = 0.003 and 0.051, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 protein and mRNA expression were correlated with HIF1A, VEGFA, GLUT1, and CAIX expression in adenocarcinoma alone. Low expression of GLUT1 and low expression of both PD-L1 and GLUT1 were associated with improved prognosis. Our findings support the rationale for co-targeting hypoxia-related genes and PD-L1 in cancer therapy. Expression of hypoxia-related genes may be helpful in selecting patients appropriate for PD-L1 therapy.",PD-L1,3

Serum IL-6 and TNF-α were measured in 10 non-small cell lung cancer patients who were evaluable within the 7 days before and after commencement of PD1-I. For CRP, medical records were reviewed and 34 patients with measured CRP within the 7 days before and after the treatment were evaluated. In the 10 patients analyzed for IL-6/TNF-α, the serum levels of IL-6/TNF-α were not significantly different between pre- and post-initial PD1-I [IL-6 20.3 (2.6-49.9) and 22.9 (3.6-96.1) pg/mL, p = 0.453; TNF-α 1.6 (0.7-6.3) and 3.3 (0.7-9.6) pg/mL, p = 0.329]; however, all four responses were observed among the 7 IL-6-elevated cases, resulting in a response rate of 57%. In the 34 patients analyzed for CRP, CRP was significantly increased after initial PD1-I [1.8 (0.1-17.8) mg/dL, 2.4 (0.0-27.8), p = 0.001]. Notably, in the 31 evaluable cases, all responses were again observed in either the IL-6 or CRP elevated groups and the response rate was 46% (11 of 24). The median overall survival time was not reached in the elevated group and was 112 days in the non-elevated group (p = 0.069).

Epub 2018 Oct 8.,Increased CD3+ T cells with a low FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio can predict anti-PD-1 therapeutic response in non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"To determine whether tumor microenvironments affect the clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy in non-small cell lung cancer, we investigated the expression level of PD-L1 and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and elucidate their predictive role. Thirty-eight pretreatment and two post-treatment specimens from 36 advanced, treatment-refractory non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent PD-1 blockade therapy were analyzed. PD-L1 expression by tumor cells and the distribution of CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3 and PD-1 positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were immunohistochemically assessed and counted using digital image analyzer. CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were distributed more in PD-L1 positive group compared to PD-L1 negative group. Conversely, EGFR mutant group showed fewer CD3+ T cells than EGFR-naïve group. The patients in the clinical benefit group with PD-1 blockade showed a higher number of CD3+, CD8+ T cells and a higher CD8+/CD3+ T cell ratio (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, and p = 0.042) and a lower FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio compared to non-responders (p = 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, increased CD3+ T cell infiltration and low FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio were found to be independent predictors of clinical benefit with PD-1 blockade (p = 0.014 and p = 0.03, respectively). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, levels of CD3+ T cells and FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio that provide the best distinguishing point between responder versus non-responder to PD-1 blockade were 617.5/mm2 and 25%, respectively (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003). Considering that 1 mm2 is about 5 high power fields (HPF), a good response to the PD-1 blockade can be expected when the number of CD3 T cells is observed to be 120 per HPF and when CD8+ T cells and FOXP3+ T cells are present at a ratio greater than 4:1. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes might become a promising biomarker as an independent predictive factor of response to PD-1 blockade that may also guide therapeutic decisions.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 26.,"TSR-033, a Novel Therapeutic Antibody Targeting LAG-3, Enhances T-Cell Function and the Activity of PD-1 Blockade In Vitro and In Vivo.","Progressive upregulation of checkpoints on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, severely compromising tumor immunity. Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) is a coinhibitory receptor associated with impaired T-cell function and is frequently coexpressed with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) in the context of human cancers. Targeting LAG-3 in conjunction with PD-1 thus represents a strategy to amplify and broaden the therapeutic impact of PD-1 blockade alone. We have generated a high affinity and selective humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody, TSR-033, which binds human LAG-3 and serves as a functional antagonist, enhancing in vitro T-cell activation both in mixed lymphocyte reactions and staphylococcal enterotoxin B-driven stimulation assays. In a humanized mouse non-small cell lung carcinoma model, TSR-033 boosted the antitumor efficacy of PD-1 monotherapy, with a concomitant increase in immune activation. Analogous studies in a murine syngeneic tumor model using surrogate antibodies demonstrated significant synergy between LAG-3 and PD-1 blockade-combination treatment led to a marked improvement in therapeutic efficacy, increased T-cell proliferation, IFNγ production, and elicited durable immunologic memory upon tumor rechallenge. Taken together, the pharmacologic activity of TSR-033 demonstrates that it is a potent anti-LAG-3 therapeutic antibody and supports its clinical investigation in cancer patients.  ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

In the present study, checkpoint proteins and ligands, including programmed death-1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), cluster of differentiation (CD)155 and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) were systematically analyzed in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Furthermore their clinicopathological features and survival rates were investigated. Immunohistochemistry was performed in order to analyze the expression of PD-L1, CD155, PD-1 and TIGIT in 60 patients with SCLC, and survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. It was reported that CD155/TIGIT and PD-L1/PD-1 were highly expressed on tissues of surgically resected SCLC. High expression levels of PD-L1, CD155 or PD-L1+CD155 were significantly associated with shorter survival. However, high expression levels of PD-1 or TIGIT exhibited no obvious association with shorter survival time. Moreover, patients with SCLC in whom PD-L1 and CD155 levels were highly expressed had the shortest survival rate. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that highly expressed PD-L1 [hazard ratio (HR)=2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.18-5.51, P=0.017] and CD155 (HR=2.40, 95% CI=1.05-5.50, P=0.038) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) time in SCLC. In addition, it was reported that TIGIT and PD-1, the receptors of CD155 and PD-L1, respectively, were also constitutively expressed on CD8+ TILs and tumor cells in SCLC.

We investigated the effects of these two therapies, combined, in the lung tissue of an orthotopic tumor-bearing mouse model. The mice received an 8 Gy dose three times with or without 200 µg anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibody intraperitoneal injection every three days. Lung tissues were H&E stained to determine histological changes. The serum levels of cytokines, such as interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-5, were detected by cytometric bead array. The neutrophil infiltration was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for myeloperoxidase. The lung injury score was higher in the treated groups than the control group, especially in the combined treatment group, in which the proportion of neutrophils in lung tissues was significantly higher compared to any other groups. Similarly, the CD4/CD8 ratio of the lung tissues in the combined treatment group, as well as the serum levels of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-5, were significantly higher than the other groups.

Analysis is commonly done on small tissue biopsy samples representing a minimal fraction of the whole tumor. The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation of PD-L1 expression on biopsy specimens with corresponding resection specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 58 consecutive cases with preoperative biopsy and resected tumor specimens were selected. From each resection specimen 2 tumor cores were compiled into a tissue microarray (TMA). Immunohistochemical staining with the antibody SP263 was performed on biopsy specimens, resection specimens (whole sections), as well as on the TMA. RESULTS: The proportion of PD-L1-positive stainings were comparable between the resection specimens (48% and 19%), the biopsies (43% and 17%), and the TMAs (47% and 14%), using cutoffs of 1% and 50%, respectively (P > .39 all comparisons). When the resection specimens were considered as reference, PD-L1 status differed in 16%/5% for biopsies and in 9%/9% for TMAs (1%/50% cutoff). The sensitivity of the biopsy analysis was 79%/82% and the specificity was 90%/98% at the 1%/50% cutoff. The Cohens κ value for the agreement between biopsy and tumor. was 0.70 at the 1% cutoff and 0.83 at the 50% cutoff. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a moderate concordance between the analysis of biopsy and whole tumor tissue, resulting in misclassification of samples in particular when the lower 1% cutoff was used.

Targeted therapy approaches are promising treatments for lung cancer. However, despite the development of targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as well as monoclonal antibodies, the five-year relative survival rate for lung cancer patients is still only 18%, and patients inevitably become resistant to therapy. Mutations in Kirsten ras sarcoma viral homolog (KRAS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the two most common genetic events in lung adenocarcinoma; they account for 25% and 20% of cases, respectively. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, and ALK rearrangements are responsible for 3-7% of NSCLC, predominantly of the adenocarcinoma subtype, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner with KRAS and EGFR mutations. Among drug-resistant NSCLC patients, nearly half exhibit the T790M mutation in exon 20 of EGFR.

Treatment stratification depends on immunohistochemical PD-L1 measurement of biopsy material, an invasive method that does not account for spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Using a single domain antibody (sdAb), NM-01, against PD-L1, radiolabeled site-specifically with technetium-99m (99mTc) for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, we aimed to assess the safety, radiation dosimetry and imaging characteristics of this radiopharmaceutical and correlate tumor uptake with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry results.

NM-01 was radiolabeled with [99mTc(OH2)3(CO)3]+ complex binding to its C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Administered activity was 3.8-10.4 MBq/kg, corresponding to 100 µg or 400 µg of NM-01. Whole body planar and thoracic SPECT/CT scans were performed at 1 and 2h post-injection in all patients and 5 patients had additional imaging at 10mins, 3 and 24h for radiation dosimetry calculations. All patients were monitored for adverse events. Results: No drug-related adverse events occurred in this study. The mean effective dose was 8.84×10-3 ± 9.33×10-4 mSv/MBq (3.59 ± 0.74 mSv per patient). Tracer uptake was observed in the kidneys, spleen, liver and bone marrow. SPECT primary tumor-blood pool ratios (T:BP) varied from 1.24 to 2.3 (mean = 1.79) at 1h and 1.24 to 3.53 (mean = 2.22) at 2h (P = 0.005). 2h primary T:BP ratios correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry results (r=0.68, P = 0.014). 2h T:BP was lower in tumors with ≤1% PD-L1 expression (1.89 vs 2.49, P = 0.048). Nodal and bone metastases showed tracer uptake. Heterogeneity (>20%) between primary tumor and nodal T:BP was present in 4 of 12 patients. Conclusion: This first in human study demonstrates that 99mTc-labeled anti-PD-L1-sdAb SPECT/CT imaging is safe and associated with acceptable dosimetry. Tumor uptake is readily visible against background tissues, particularly at 2h when the T:BP ratio correlates with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry results.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Correlations Between the Immune-related Adverse Events Spectrum and Efficacy of Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy in NSCLC Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) developed during immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 agents, could be a predictive surrogate marker of clinical benefit in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Patients with NSCLC, treated with anti-PD-1 agents, were retrospectively evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between types of irAEs (differentiated according to system/organ involved and to single-site/multiple-site), overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We further performed a 6-week landmark analysis. RESULTS: A total of 559 patients were enrolled; 231 patients (41.3%) developed irAEs of any grade and 50 patients (8.9%) G3/G4 events; 191 of them (82.6%) developed single-site irAEs and 40 (17.4%) multiple-site irAEs. At multivariate analysis, higher ORR was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), single-site irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine (P = .0043) and skin irAEs (P = .0005). Longer PFS was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), single-site irAEs (P < .0001), multiple-site irAEs (P = .0374), endocrine irAEs (P = .0084) and skin irAEs (P = .0001). Longer OS was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), single-site irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine irAEs (P = .0044), gastrointestinal irAEs (P = .0437), skin irAEs (P = .0006), and others irAEs (P = .0378). At the 6-week landmark analysis, irAEs of any grade was confirmed an independent predictor of higher ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that irAEs are concordantly related to higher ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

This review discusses the evolution of pegylated IL-10 (pegilodecakin) from preclinical investigation through first-in-human studies in oncology. RECENT FINDINGS: Pegilodecakin was evaluated across multiple advanced solid tumors in a large phase 1/1b trial alone and in combination with chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 antibodies. Pegilodecakin monotherapy had immunologic and clinical activity in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and uveal melanoma. In combination with anti-PD-1 inhibitors, pegilodecakin increased the responses in RCC and lung cancer with efficacy agnostic to PD-L1 status and tumor mutational burden. Pegilodecakin with FOLFOX had activity in pretreated pancreatic cancer, instructing the ongoing randomized phase III trial of the combination versus FOLFOX. The increased half-life of pegilodecakin enabled compelling preclinical data for IL-10 which has now been confirmed by clinical activity in a variety of cancers. The ability of pegilodecakin to both exert anti-tumor immunity and inhibit tumor-associated inflammation characterizes the uniqueness of this cytokine therapy.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Pseudoprogression on treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies: Case series and short literature review.,"Gastrointestinal cancers are very common cancers with colorectal being the fourth most common type, gastric the sixth, and esophageal the tenth. Although recent advances have been made in management including incorporation of antiangiogenic, anti-EGFR, and anti-HER2 directed therapies, overall their prognosis remains poor. Anti-PD-1 therapy with nivolumab and pembrolizumab are licensed for advanced chemorefractory gastroesophageal cancer and many other checkpoint inhibitor therapies are being assessed alone and in combination in these diseases. One of the challenges posed in assessing response to immunotherapy treatment is the phenomenon of pseudoprogression. This phenomenon, which is well described in patients with malignant melanoma is most frequently described as a size increase of contrast enhancing lesions or appearance of new lesions that stabilize or reduce in size with time. Most other solid tumors have a low incidence of pseudoprogression although cases have been reported for lung, head, and neck cancer and a range of gliomas. Herein we present 6 cases of patients with gastrointestinal cancers who were treated with anti-PD1 (programmed cell death) and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand-1) antibodies, and experience pseudoprogression.",PD-L1,3

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab between January 2016 and September 2018 for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on baseline computed tomography was assessed to calculate the psoas muscle index (PMI). Sarcopenia was defined based on PMI cut-off values for Asian adults (6.36 cm2/m2 for males and 3.92 cm2/m2 for females). A total of 42 patients were analysed. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 52.4%. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) (median, 2.1 vs. 6.8 months, p = 0.004). Compared to patients with sarcopenia, those without sarcopenia had a higher overall response rate (40.0% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.025) and 1-year PFS rate (38.1% vs. 10.1%). In conclusion, sarcopenia at baseline as determined using computed tomography is a significant predictor of worse outcome in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving PD-1 blockade. Screening for sarcopenia may help identify patients more likely to achieve a long-term response in routine clinical practice.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Multiple sclerosis outcomes after cancer immunotherapy.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurological immune-related adverse events are a rare but potentially deadly complication after immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. As multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease, it is unknown how ICI treatment may affect outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, avelumab, and durvalumab 2 years prior their FDA approval until December 31, 2017, to include all cases with confirmed diagnosis/relapse of MS. We also included cases reported in the literature and a patient from our institution. RESULTS: We identified 14 cases of MS with median age of presentation of 52 years. Indications for ICI included melanoma in 7 (36.36%) cases, non-small cell lung carcinoma in 2 (18.18%) cases, 1 case (9.09%) each of pleural mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, and unreported in 2 (18.18%) cases. History of MS was confirmed in 8 (57.1%) cases. Median time to beginning of symptoms was 29 days with rapid disease progression; two patients died due to their relapse. Median time for symptom resolution was 8 weeks. Outcomes did not vary by comparing CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Reported MS relapses after ICI are rare, but the adverse events described include rapid neurologic progression and death. Larger and prospective studies are warranted to assess disability and long-term outcomes and outweigh the risks of starting immunotherapy in patients with MS.",PD-L1,3

Pembrolizumab, which targets PD-1, has been approved as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with positive PD-L1 expression. However, PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades have not achieved breakthroughs in treating glioblastoma because glioblastoma has a low immunogenic response and an immunosuppressive microenvironment caused by the precise crosstalk between cytokines and immune cells. A phase III clinical trial, Checkmate 143, reported that nivolumab, which targets PD-1, did not demonstrate survival benefits compared with bavacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma patients. Thus, the combination of a PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade with RT, TMZ, antibodies targeting other inhibitory or stimulatory molecules, targeted therapy, and vaccines may be an appealing solution aimed at achieving optimal clinical benefit. There are many ongoing clinical trials exploring the efficacy of various approaches based on PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades in primary or recurrent glioblastoma patients. Many challenges need to be overcome, including the identification of discrepancies between different genomic subtypes in their response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades, the selection of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades for primary versus recurrent glioblastoma, and the identification of the optimal combination and sequence of combination therapy. In this review, we describe the immunosuppressive molecular characteristics of the tumour microenvironment (TME), candidate biomarkers of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades, ongoing clinical trials and challenges of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades in glioblastoma.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Efficacy of nintedanib and docetaxel in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma treated with first-line chemotherapy and second-line immunotherapy in the nintedanib NPU program.,"PURPOSE: Both nintedanib/docetaxel and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies have demonstrated efficacy as second-line treatment of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. This is the first report on the efficacy of the nintedanib/docetaxel combination following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and subsequent immunotherapy in a real-world setting. METHODS/PATIENTS: From May 2014 to December 2015, 390 patients in 108 Spanish centres enrolled in the nintedanib named patient use program. Inclusion criteria were advanced lung adenocarcinoma with progressive disease following at least one line of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the nintedanib/docetaxel combination in patients who also received immunotherapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients met the inclusion criteria; with a median age of 67 years. PD-L1 expression was positive in six patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was 3.3 months (95% CI 1.9-4.6). Second-line immunotherapy was pembrolizumab (36.5%), atezolizumab (36.5%) or nivolumab (27%). Median PFS of second-line immunotherapy was 2.3 months (95% CI 0-6.1). The overall response rate (ORR) to second-line immunotherapy was 18% with a disease-control rate (DCR) of 45%. Median PFS of nintedanib/docetaxel was 3.2 months (95% CI 1.9-4.5). Best response was partial response in four patients (36%), stable disease in five patients (46%), and progressive disease in two patients (18%), for an ORR of 36% and a DCR of 82%. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests an encouraging efficacy of nintedanib/docetaxel in patients with adenocarcinoma NSCLC pretreated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and immunotherapy, reinforcing the importance of an optimal therapeutic sequence for managing advanced lung adenocarcinoma.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Local tumor response and survival outcomes after combined stereotactic radiosurgery and immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases.,"OBJECTIVEConcurrent use of anti-PD-1 therapies with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have been shown to be beneficial for survival and local lesional control in melanoma patients with brain metastases. It is not known, however, if immunotherapy (IT) confers the same outcome advantage in lung cancer patients with brain metastases treated with SRS.METHODSThe authors retrospectively reviewed 85 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastases who were treated with SRS between January 2006 and December 2016. Thirty-nine PD-L1 antibody-positive patients received anti-PD-1 therapy with SRS (IT group) and 46 patients received chemotherapy (CT) with SRS (CT group). Results were obtained using chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, and Mann-Whitney U tests and Cox regression analyses.RESULTSMedian survival following first radiosurgical treatment in the whole study group was 11.6 months (95% CI 8-15.5 months). Median survival times in the IT group and CT group were 10 months (95% CI 8.3-13.2 months) and 11.6 months (95% CI 7.7-15.6 months), respectively (p = 0.23). A Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score < 80 (p = 0.001) and lung-specific molecular marker Graded Prognostic Assessment (lungmol GPA) score < 1.5 (p = 0.02) were found to be predictive of worse survival.Maximal percent lesional shrinkage and time to maximal shrinkage were not significantly different between the CT and IT groups. Of the lesions for which a complete response occurred, 94.8% had pre-SRS volumes < 500 mm3. The amount of lesion shrinkage and time to maximal shrinkage were not different between the IT and CT groups for lesions with volumes < 500 mm3. However, in lesions with volume > 500 mm3, 90% of lesions shrank after radiosurgery in the IT group compared with 47.8% in the CT group (p = 0.001). Median times to initial response and times to maximal shrinkage were faster in the IT group than in the CT group: initial response 49 days (95% CI 33.7-64.3 days) versus 84 days (95% CI 28.1-140 days), p = 0.001; maximal response 105 days (95% CI 59-150 days) versus 182 days (95% CI 119.6-244 days), p = 0.12.CONCLUSIONSUnlike patients with melanoma, patients with NSCLC with brain metastases undergoing SRS showed no significant benefit-either in terms of survival or total amount of lesional response-when anti-PD-1 therapies were used. However, in lesions with volume > 500 mm3, combining SRS with IT may result in a faster and better volumetric response which may be particularly beneficial in lesions causing mass effect or located in neurologically critical locations.",PD-L1,3

Targeting of KLRG1 neutralization in murine cancer models has not previously been reported. Methods: We studied KLRG1 expression in human blood and tumor samples from available genomic datasets. Anti-KLRG1 neutralizing antibody was studied in the murine 4T1 breast cancer as monotherapy, and in the MC38 colon cancer and B16F10 melanoma models as combination therapy with anti-PD-1 antibody. Results: In human blood and tumor samples, KLRG1 expression is aligned with cytotoxic T and NK cell differentiation, and upregulated in human tumor samples after a variety of therapies, potentially contributing to adaptive resistance. In in vivo murine models, anti-KLRG1 antibody monotherapy in the 4T1 breast cancer model reduced lung metastases (decreased lung weights p=0.04; decreased nodule count p=0.002), while anti-KLRG1 + anti-PD-1 combination therapy in the MC38 colon cancer and B16F10 melanoma models produced synergistic benefit greater than anti-PD-1 alone for tumor volume (MC38 p=0.01; B16F10 p=0.007) and survival (MC38 p=0.02; B16F10 p=0.002). Conclusions: These studies provide the first evidence that inhibition of the KLRG1 pathway enhances immune control of cancer in murine models, and provide target validation for KLRG1 targeting of human cancer. The mechanism of efficacy of KLRG1 blockade in murine models remains to be determined.",PD-L1,3

Elevated levels of PD-L1 expression were observed on NSCLC cells. The association between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features is still unclear. Therefore, we examined this relationship and also compare PD-L1 expression levels with Ki-67, p63 and TTF-1. METHODS: 866 samples of NSCLCs were used to prepare tissue microarrays (TMAs) on which immunohistochemical (IHC) reactions were performed. Changes in the level of CD274 (PD-L1) gene expression in 62 NSCLC tumors were tested in relation to 14 normal lung tissues by real-time PCR reactions (RT-PCR). RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was observed in 32.6% of NSCLCs. PD-L1 expression was increased in higher malignancy grades (G) (p < 0.0001) and in higher lymph node status (pN) (p = 0.0428). The patients with low PD-L1 expression had longer overall survival compared to the group with high expression (p = 0.0332) in adenocarcinoma (AC) only. CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 expression seems to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and aggressiveness as well as shorter patient survival in NSCLC, predominantly in the AC group.",PD-L1,3

However, only one-quarter of patients benefit from these new therapies when used as monotherapy. The assessment of Program Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor expression by immunohistochemistry is used to select potential responder patients, but this not an optimal marker since it does not predict the absence of anti PD-1 efficacy. Despite this shortcoming, PD-L1 remains the gold standard biomarker in many studies and the only biomarker available for clinicians. In addition to histological markers, transcriptomic and exome analyses have revealed potential biomarkers requiring further confirmation. Recently, tumor mutational burden has emerged as a good surrogate marker of outcome. In this review we will detail current knowledge on DNA and RNA related biomarkers.",PD-L1,3

[Epub ahead of print],Safety and Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy in Patients With HIV Infection and Advanced-Stage Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"Importance: Patients with HIV infection are at increased risk for cancer. Cancer is the leading cause of death among non-AIDS-defining illnesses in these patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has transformed the treatment of cancer. However, clinical trials of ICIs have historically excluded patients with HIV infection. The safety and efficacy profile of ICIs is unknown in this underrepresented population. Objective: To summarize results on the safety and efficacy of ICI therapy in HIV-infected patients with advanced-stage cancer. Evidence Review: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A literature search of PubMed was performed on April 16, 2018, using the keyword HIV and the names of ICIs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab). Patients with HIV infection who were being treated with ICIs for advanced-stage cancer were included. In addition, abstracts and posters from major oncology and AIDS society annual meetings from 2016 through 2018 were reviewed. Findings: Seventy-three patients (66 [90.4%] male; mean age, 56.1 years [ range, 30.0-77.0 years]) were identified from 13 articles (11 case reports and 2 case series) and 4 meeting abstracts. Sixty-two patients were treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy, 6 with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) therapy, 4 with anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy, and 1 with sequential ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy was generally well tolerated, with grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events noted in 6 of 70 patients (8.6%). Among 34 patients with known paired pretreatment and posttreatment HIV loads, HIV remained suppressed in 26 of the 28 (93%) with undetectable HIV load. Among the 25 with paired pretreatment and posttreatment CD4 cell counts, the counts increased (mean [SD] change, 12.3 [28.5] /μL). Objective response rates were 30% for non-small cell lung cancer, 27% for melanoma, and 63% for Kaposi sarcoma. Conclusions and Relevance: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for the treatment of advanced-stage cancer in patients with HIV infection was associated with no new safety signals. Immune checkpoint inhibitors may be a safe and efficacious treatment option in this patient population. Several ongoing prospective clinical trials will shed further light on the safety and efficacy of ICI therapy in HIV-infected patients with cancer.",PD-L1,3

In this study, we investigated the clinical outcomes of patients treated with sequential immunotherapy. Methods We performed a retrospective review of 90 advanced stage cancer patients treated on immunotherapy-based phase 1 clinical trials at Winship Cancer Institute from 2009 to 2017. We included 49 patients with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-indicated histology. Patients were analyzed based on whether they had received prior ICI. Clinical outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and clinical benefit (best response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease). Univariate analysis (UVA) and multivariate analysis (MVA) were performed using Cox proportional hazard or logistic regression model. Covariates included age, liver metastases, number of prior lines of therapy, histology, and Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) risk group. Results The most common histologies were melanoma (61%) and lung/head and neck cancers (37%). More than half of patients (n = 27, 55%) received at least one ICI prior to trial enrollment: ten received anti-PD-1, two received anti-CTLA-4, five received anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination, and ten received multiple ICI. In MVA, ICI-naïve patients had significantly longer OS (HR: 0.22, CI: 0.07-0.70, p = 0.010) and trended towards higher chance of CB (HR: 2.52, CI: 0.49-12.97, p = 0.268). Patients who received prior ICI had substantially shorter median OS (10.9 vs 24.3 months, p = 0.046) and PFS (2.8 vs. 5.1 months, p = 0.380) than ICI-naïve patients per Kaplan-Meier estimation. Within the ICI-naïve group, 78% (7 of 9) of patients who received prior interleukin (IL-2) or interferon gamma (IFNγ) experienced disease control for at least 6 months, compared to a disease control rate of 15% (2 of 13) in patients who had received chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or no prior treatment. Conclusions ICI-naïve patients may experience improved clinical outcomes on immunotherapy-based phase 1 clinical trials than patients who have received prior ICI. This may be particularly true for patients who received prior IL-2 or IFNγ. Further development of immunotherapy combination therapies is needed to improve clinical outcomes of these patients.

[Epub ahead of print],EGFR-targeted therapy alters the tumor microenvironment in EGFR-driven lung tumors: Implications for combination therapies.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death receptor/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway have profoundly improved the clinical management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, the superiority of single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in pretreated EGFR mutant patients has turned out to be moderate. One proposed mechanism for poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors is an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we utilized two autochthonous EGFR-driven lung tumor models to investigate dynamic microenvironmental responses to EGFR-TKI treatment. We observed that at an early stage, sensitive EGFR-TKIs caused obvious tumor shrinkage accompanied by increased cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells, eradication of Foxp3+ Tregs, and inhibition of M2-like polarization of macrophages. However, the tumor microenvironmental changes that may be most beneficial for combination treatment with immune-mediated anticancer approaches were only temporary and disappeared as treatment continued. Meanwhile, the level of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), particularly mononuclear MDSCs, was consistently elevated throughout the treatment. Analysis of inflammatory factors in serum showed that EGFR-TKIs increased the levels of IL-10 and CCL-2. Our study systematically analyzed dynamic changes in tumor microenvironments responding to EGFR-TKIs in vivo. The results have implications for combination therapy using EGFR-TKIs. The optimal sequence of the treatment and strategies that modulate the tumor microenvironment to a state that may favor antitumor immune responses need to be considered when designing clinical trials.© 2019 UICC.",PD-L1,3

Histologically it is characterized by small cells with scant cytoplasm, absent or inconspicuous nucleoli, extensive necrosis, and expresses neuroendocrine markers. It is on a spectrum of neuroendocrine cancer that extend from typical carcinoids to large cell to small cell cancer. Clinically it behaves in a more malignant fashion with a rapid doubling time, early metastasis. They respond rapidly to cytotoxic treatment however tend to develop resistance soon. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors take advantage of PD 1 ligand-receptor axis between the tumor and T cells or CTLA4 on T cells which when engaged lead to inhibition of T cells. This inhibition helps tumors to evade immune surveillance. Checkpoint inhibitors break this axis by either binding to PD 1 ligands or PD 1 to CTLA4, thereby preventing tumors to evade the immune systems. This has led to remarkable responses in tumors. The immune related adverse effects can be severe however are experienced at much lower rates as compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Recently, CheckMate 032 has shown impressive response rates with Nivolumab and Nivolumab/Ipilimumab in relapsed small cell cancer. IMpower 133, a phase 3 trial showed that addition of Atezolizumab to Carbo/Etoposide led to a significant survival benefit in treatment naive extensive small cell cancer. This review will summarize recent developments and ongoing studies of immune therapy in extensive small cell cancer in addition to a brief summary of immune therapy landscape of Non small cell lung cancer. Investigational approaches to immune therapy have also been delineated.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 5.,Cocktail Strategy Based on Spatio-Temporally Controlled Nano Device Improves Therapy of Breast Cancer.,"Metastatic breast cancer may be resistant to chemo-immunotherapy due to the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC). Also, the control of particle size and drug release of a drug carrier for multidrug combination is a key issue influencing the therapy effect. Here, a cocktail strategy is reported, in which chemotherapy against both bulk tumor cells and CSC and immune checkpoint blockade therapy are intergraded into one drug delivery system. The chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (PTX), the anti-CSC agent thioridazine (THZ), and the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor HY19991 (HY) are all incorporated into an enzyme/pH dual-sensitive nanoparticle with a micelle-liposome double-layer structure. The particle size shrinks when the nanoparticle transfers from circulation to tumor tissues, favoring both pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake, meanwhile achieving sequential drug release where needed. This nano device, named PM@THL, increases the intratumoral drug concentrations in mice and exhibits significant anticancer efficacy, with tumor inhibiting rate of 93.45% and lung metastasis suppression rate of 97.64%. It also reduces the proportion of CSC and enhances the T cells infiltration in tumor tissues, and thus prolongs the survival of mice. The cocktail therapy based on the spatio-temporally controlled nano device will be a promising strategy for treating breast cancer.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",PD-L1,3

Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand-2 (PD-L2). Pembrolizumab was first approved by the FDA in 2014 for the treatment of advanced melanoma and is currently approved for use in non-small cell lung cancer and several other neoplasms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have been reported to induce immune-mediated side effects, including type 1 diabetes mellitus in very rare cases (0.1% in clinical trials). Here, we report the case of a woman with no known history of diabetes who presented to our emergency department in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis within 3 weeks of receiving only a single dose of pembrolizumab therapy, and without any previous exposure to immunotherapy. This case of abrupt adult-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus is an example of the undesirable side effects that can emerge after only a brief exposure to an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Close monitoring of patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors is warranted for the early diagnosis and management of imminent and potentially life-threatening complications.",PD-L1,3

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from patients who received ≥1 dose of single-agent PD1 inhibitor between August 3, 2011 and August 31, 2016 were obtained from our Institutions pharmacy database. AEs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-two patients received at least one dose of single-agent PD1 inhibitor prior to data cut-off. After excluding 14 patients with uncommon malignancies, the total number of patients were 168. The median age was 63 (range=24-92) years. There were 87 (52%) cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 35 (21%) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 12 (7%) of melanoma, 18 (11%) of Hodgkins lymphomas, eight (5%) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and eight (5%) of small cell lung cancer. Considering grade 2 or more AEs, 30 (18%) patients had kidney injury, 34 (20%) hypothyroidism, 36 (21%) transaminitis, 20 (12%) pneumonitis, and 18 (11%) colitis. Patients with RCC had higher odds of experiencing grade 2 or more kidney injury than patients with other primary tumor types (adjusted p=0.025), whereas patients with Hodgkins lymphoma and HNSCC had higher odds of grade 2 hypothyroidism (adjusted p=0.005). Patients with NSCLC had higher risk of death with pneumonitis than those whose primary cancer was not NSCLC (adjusted p=0.005). DISCUSSION: The increased odds of patients with Hodgkins lymphoma and HNSCC experiencing grade 2 or more hypothyroidism may be related to previous radiation exposure. Most patients with RCC had undergone nephrectomy, making them more susceptible to acute kidney injury. When pneumonitis occurred in patients with primary NSCLC, the overall survival was significantly worse. The duration of PD1 therapy was significantly associated with onset of pneumonitis (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: The site of primary tumor or metastasis may help predict the most common AEs in patients treated with PD1 inhibitors.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Oct 4.,Over-expression of PD-1 Does Not Predict Leukemic Relapse after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.,"Blockade of the T-cell exhaustion marker PD-1 to re-energize the immune response is emerging as a promising cancer treatment. Relapse of hematologic malignancy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation limits the success of this approach, and PD-1 blockade may hold therapeutic promise. However, PD-1 expression and its relationship with post-transplant relapse is poorly described. Because the donor immunity is activated by alloresponses, PD-1 expression may differ from nontransplanted individuals, and PD-1 blockade could risk graft-versus-host disease. Here we analyzed T-cell exhaustion marker kinetics and their relationship with leukemia relapse in 85 patients undergoing myeloablative T-cell-depleted HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 35 (44%) patients relapsed. PD-1 expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells was comparably elevated in relapsed and nonrelapsed cohorts. Helios+ regulatory T cells and CD8 effector memory cells at day 30 emerged as independent predictors of relapse. Although leukemia antigen-specific T cells did not overexpress PD-1, single-cell analysis revealed LAG3 and TIM3 overexpression at relapse. These findings indicate that PD-1 is an unreliable marker for leukemia-specific T-cell exhaustion in relapsing patients but implies other exhaustion markers and suppressor cells as relapse biomarkers.",PD-L1,3

Immune response has long been a question of great interest in a wide range of fields such as cancer therapies and anti-tumor immunity through checkpoint inhibitors, specifically anti PD-1/ PD-L1 interaction, is a new line of research for treatment of CRC patients. Following the successful development of anti-PD-1 for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, several clinical trials have been conducted on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PD-1 in CRC. There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of anti-PD-1 therapy for MSI (Microsatellite instability) tumors among CRC subtypes. We present a comprehensive knowledge of immune therapy through PD-1/PD-L1 blockade that argues how efficient the process is, in colon cancer carcinoma. In this review, we discuss the responsiveness of immunotherapy on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and various tactics for overcoming weak responses to these checkpoint inhibitors in CRC. More research using controlled trials is required to enable new discoveries to provide continued success with immune-based therapies and grounds for optimism about the future of CRC patients.",PD-L1,3

We thus conducted this meta-analysis to compare the relative efficacy of nivolumab vs docetaxel-based chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through searches of databases and conference proceedings. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), drug responses, and adverse effects (AEs) were assessed as the primary endpoints. RESULTS: After screening, we included six studies (949 patients) in the final analysis. Nivolumab showed better efficacy in terms of the PFS (hazard ratios [HR]: 0.70, P = 0.03), OS (HR: 0.70, P < 0.00001), objective response rate (ORR) (risk ratios [RR]: 1.73, P = 0.0008), total AEs (RR: 0.77, P = 0.006), and grade 3-5 AEs (RR: 0.18, P < 0.00001) than docetaxel. The anti-tumor efficacy of nivolumab for NSCLC in terms of both PFS and OS was positively correlated with the level of PD-L1 expression. In the nivolumab treatment arm, the 10 most-reported AEs were fatigue (15.7%), nausea (10.8%), decreased appetite (10.3%), asthenia (9.8%), diarrhea (7.5%), rash (7.5%), arthralgia (5.4%), vomiting (4.4%), constipation (3.5%), and pyrexia (3.3%). CONCLUSIONS: For advanced NSCLC, nivolumab is a better therapy in terms of both anti-tumor efficacy and safety than docetaxel-based chemotherapy. More high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.© 2019 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,Antibody-Fc/FcR Interaction on Macrophages as a Mechanism for Hyperprogressive Disease in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Subsequent to PD-1/PD-L1 Blockade.,"PURPOSE: Hyperprogression (HP), a paradoxical boost in tumor growth, was described in a subset of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Neither clinicopathologic features nor biological mechanisms associated with HP have been identified. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Among 187 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICI at our institute, cases with HP were identified according to clinical and radiologic criteria. Baseline histologic samples from patients treated with ICI were evaluated by IHC for myeloid and lymphoid markers. T-cell-deficient mice, injected with human lung cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) belonging to specific mutational subsets, were assessed for tumor growth after treatment with antibodies against mouse and human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). The immune microenvironment was evaluated by flow cytometry and IHC. RESULTS: Among 187 patients, 152 were evaluable for clinical response. We identified four categories: 32 cases were defined as responders (21%), 42 patients with stable disease (27.7%), 39 cases were defined as progressors (25.7%), and 39 patients with HP (25.7%). Pretreatment tissue samples from all patients with HP showed tumor infiltration by M2-like CD163+CD33+PD-L1+ clustered epithelioid macrophages. Enrichment by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) was observed, even in tumor nodules from immunodeficient mice injected with human lung cancer cells and with PDXs. In these models, tumor growth was enhanced by treatment with anti-PD-1 but not anti-PD-1 F(ab)2 fragments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a crucial role of TAM reprogramming, upon Fc receptor engagement by ICI, eventually inducing HP and provide clues on a distinctive immunophenotype potentially able to predict HP.See related commentary by Knorr and Ravetch, p. 904.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",PD-L1,3

Unlike cytotoxic chemotherapy, drugs such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab are associated with immune-related adverse effects. We recently observed a patient with lung cancer who developed a fulminant warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). OBJECTIVES: Investigate the frequency and prognosis of AIHA secondary to CPI in a public database and review the literature. RESULTS: A total of 68 cases were identified in the database of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 43 were associated with nivolumab, 13 with pembrolizumab, seven with ipilimumab, and five with atezolizumab. All episodes of AIHA were listed as serious. If the total number of adverse events cases reported to the FDA is taken as a reference, AIHA is rare, but occurred more frequently with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents (0.15%-0.25%) than with CTLA-4 inhibitors (0.06%). In addition to our case, the literature review identified 11 similar cases. Most cases of AIHA responded to steroids, but two of 12 were fatal.

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,Immunological Agents Used in Cancer Treatment.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), or PD-1 ligand (PD-L1). ICI are approved for the treatment of malign melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. They can lead to long-term anti-tumor responses by deactivating the brake mechanism in the immune system. Ipilimumab, tremelimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are examples of ICI. CTLA-4 is a brake mechanism in immune response. Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are antibodies against CTLA-4. PD-1 is another important immune checkpoint co-inhibitor receptor that is expressed by activated T cells in the peripheral tissue. As a result of blockage of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, local tumor-specific immune response augments, and long-term tumor control can be achieved. In recent years, ICI are approved for the treatment of various malignities. They may be responsible for specific toxicities called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs are a consequence infiltration of normal tissues by activated T lymphocytes that are responsible for autoimmunity. Corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, such as infliximab and mycophenolate mofetil, are effective in the treatment of irAEs. Immune checkpoint inhibition with monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1 by single agent or combination treatments became a new option in various solid tumors. However, ICI have unique adverse events, and these adverse events should be considered in any new onset clinical situation and should be managed properly. Future prospective randomized clinical trials will clarify recent questions.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 13.,"T-Cell-Inflamed Gene-Expression Profile, Programmed Death Ligand 1 Expression, and Tumor Mutational Burden Predict Efficacy in Patients Treated With Pembrolizumab Across 20 Cancers: KEYNOTE-028.","PURPOSE: Biomarkers that can predict response to anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy across multiple tumor types include a T-cell-inflamed gene-expression profile (GEP), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Associations between these biomarkers and the clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a clinical trial that encompassed 20 cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: KEYNOTE-028 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054806) is a nonrandomized, phase Ib trial that enrolled 475 patients with PD-L1-positive advanced solid tumors who were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 2 years or until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; by RECIST v1.1, investigator review). Secondary end points included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Relationships between T-cell-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB and antitumor activity were exploratory end points. RESULTS: ORRs (with 95% CIs) ranged from 0% (0.0% to 14.2%) in pancreatic cancer to 33% (15.6% to 55.3%) in small-cell lung cancer. Across cohorts, median (95% CI) PFS ranged from 1.7 months (1.5 to 2.9 months) to 6.8 months (1.9 to 14.1 months) in pancreatic and thyroid cancers, respectively, and median OS from 3.9 months (2.8 to 5.5 months) to 21.1 months (9.1 to 22.4 months) in vulvar and carcinoid tumors, respectively. Higher response rates and longer PFS were demonstrated in tumors with higher T-cell-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and/or TMB. Correlations of TMB with GEP and PD-L1 were low. Response patterns indicate that patients with tumors that had high levels of both TMB and inflammatory markers (GEP or PD-L1) represent a population with the highest likelihood of response. Safety was similar and consistent with prior pembrolizumab reports. CONCLUSION: A T-cell--inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB predicted response to pembrolizumab in multiple tumor types. These biomarkers (alone/in combination) may help identify patients who have a higher likelihood of response to anti-PD-1 therapies across a broad spectrum of cancers.",PD-L1,3

Clinical experience with response prediction based on PD-L1 expression suggests that other factors influence sensitivity to ICIs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: Tumor specimens from 120 NSCLC patients from 10 institutions were evaluated for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and global proliferative profile by targeted RNA-seq. RESULTS: Cell proliferation, derived from the mean expression of 10 proliferation-associated genes (namely BUB1, CCNB2, CDK1, CDKN3, FOXM1, KIAA0101, MAD2L1, MELK, MKI67, and TOP2A), was identified as a marker of response to ICIs in NSCLC. Poorly, moderately, and highly proliferative tumors were somewhat equally represented in NSCLC, with tumors with the highest PD-L1 expression being more frequently moderately proliferative as compared to lesser levels of PD-L1 expression. Proliferation status had an impact on survival in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. There was a significant survival advantage for moderately proliferative tumors compared to their combined highly/poorly counterparts (p = 0.021). Moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors had a median survival of 14.6 months that was almost twice that of PD-L1 negative highly/poorly proliferative at 7.6 months (p = 0.028). Median survival in moderately proliferative PD-L1 negative tumors at 12.6 months was comparable to that of highly/poorly proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors at 11.5 months, but in both instances less than that of moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors. Similar to survival, proliferation status has impact on disease control (DC) in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. Patients with moderately versus those with poorly or highly proliferative tumors have a superior DC rate when combined with any classification schema used to score PD-L1 as a positive result (i.e., TPS ≥ 50% or ≥ 1%), and best displayed by a DC rate for moderately proliferative tumors of no less than 40% for any classification of PD-L1 as a negative result. While there is an over representation of moderately proliferative tumors as PD-L1 expression increases this does not account for the improved survival or higher disease control rates seen in PD-L1 negative tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Cell proliferation is potentially a new biomarker of response to ICIs in NSCLC and is applicable to PD-L1 negative tumors.",PD-L1,3

The risk of pneumonitis associated with checkpoint inhibition therapy is not well described. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing anti-PD/PD-L1 mono-immunotherapy (IMM) to chemotherapy (CTH) protocols in cancer patients. The primary endpoint was the pneumonitis rate in IMM compared to CTH. Secondary endpoints were (I) high-grade pneumonitis rate in IMM compared to CTH and (II) tumor response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) between IMM and CTH. Random model and leave-one-out-analysis were performed. Results: Thirteen RCTs studying 7,246 patients were included; 3,704 (51.12%) patients in the IMM arm and 3,542 (48.88%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. Seven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) RCTs were included with 4,164 patients; 2,101 in the IMM arm and 2,063 patients in the CTH arm. Three RCTs were on melanoma patients (n=1,390). Nine RCTs compared mono-immunotherapy to CTH [docetaxel in 5 studies (38.5%), platinum-based in 2 studies (15.4%), dacarbazine in 1 study (7.7%) and everolimus in 1 study]. Both high-grade and all-grade pneumonitis were higher among patients in the IMM arm when compared to the CTH arm (OR =4.39, 95% CI: 1.65-11.69, P=0.003 and OR =2.46, 95% CI: 1.29-4.6, P=0.007).

PFS and OS were longer in patients who received IMM compared to patients in the CTH arm (HR =0.75, 95% CI: 0.65-0.85, P<0.001, and HR =0.71, 95% CI: 0.66-0.77, P<0.001). Conclusions: The incidence of high-grade and all-grade pneumonitis is higher in anti-PD-1 therapy but not in anti-PD-L1 therapy when compared to traditional CTH regimens for NSCLC and melanoma. High-grade adverse events were otherwise more common in the CTH arm. Tumor response rate, PFS, and OS are all substantially improved with IMM over CTH. These results can be used to guide therapy selection and set expectations for treatment effect in these patients.",PD-L1,3

Due to its rarity, little has been established about its optimal treatment in the advanced stage. We report the case of a 41-year-old woman diagnosed with an unresectable locally advanced L-LCNEC who presented an impressive tumor response to immunotherapy with nivolumab after non-curative thoracic radiotherapy. Salvage surgery was then performed, and pathologic analysis of the resected piece revealed the absence of residual viable tumor cells.

Epub 2018 Dec 10.,Co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 in lung squamous cell carcinoma: Potential targets of novel combination therapy.,"OBJECTIVES: Combination therapy with an inhibitor of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and an agent targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expected to be a novel and effective treatment option for various solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore, it is important to elucidate the clinical and pathological features of tumors with IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and the association between IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and efficacy of combination therapy in NSCLC patients. In this study, we examined the prognostic impact of IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and its relationship with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in primary lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of IDO1, PD-L1, Ki-67, cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), CD4, and CD8 in 202 patients with surgically resected primary lung SCC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Among 202 patients, 176 (87.1%) were positive for IDO1 expression, 106 (52.5%) were positive for PD-L1 expression, and 99 (49.0%) showed co-expression of IDO1/PD-L1 proteins. Fishers exact test showed a significant association between IDO1 and PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (P =  0.0011). Kaplan-Meier curve showed that PD-L1 alone and co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 were significantly associated with shorter overall survival, but IDO1 alone was not (log rank test: P =  0.0122, P =  0.0303 and P =  0.5168, respectively). The Ki-67 labeling index was significantly higher in patients with co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 than in patients without co-expression (Students t-test: P =  0.0005). Moreover, IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression was significantly associated with high CD3, CD4, and CD8 expression (Fishers exact test: P =  0.0033, P =  0.0003, and P <  0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: IDO1 expression correlated to PD-L1 expression, and co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 may be important targets for immunotherapy in lung SCC.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 26.,The impact of high PD-L1 expression on the surrogate endpoints and clinical outcomes of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports have indicated that the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) cannot serve as surrogates for predicting overall survival (OS) in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) trials. We performed a trial-based correlative analysis to evaluate conventional endpoints as surrogates for predicting OS in ICI-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: A systematic electronic literature search for randomized clinical trials using ICI monotherapies for NSCLC revealed 7 trials. The correlative analysis to clarify the correlations among clinical outcomes used a weighted Spearman rank correlation coefficient (wS), weighted Pearson correlation coefficient (wP), and weighted linear regression model (wL) in all patients and patients with high PD-L1 expression. RESULTS: The correlative analysis of the total population revealed that the odds ratio of the ORR (OR-ORR) and the hazard ratio of OS (HR-OS) were strongly correlated with the hazard ratio of PFS (HR-PFS) (R for wP and wS, R2 for wL; -0.869, -0.968, 0.756 between OR-ORR and HR-PFS; 0.923, 0.959, 0.851 between HR-PFS and HR-OS). The strongest correlation was observed between one-year overall survival (1y-OS) and the HR-OS (R for wP and wS, R2 for wL; 0.985, 1.000, R2: 0.968). In those with high PD-L1 expression, the ORR and PFS were strongly associated with OS (R2: 0.842 between ORR and OS; 0.771 between PFS and OS). CONCLUSIONS: The OR-ORR and HR-PFS could serve as surrogate endpoints for predicting the HR-OS in randomized trials using ICIs for NSCLC, while the ORR and PFS could be useful endpoints for predicting OS in trials with patient selection based on high PD-L1 expression.",PD-L1,3

The present report describes a 71-year-old man with clear cell renal cell carcinoma metastasis in the lung. Following the 14th course of nivolumab therapy, the patient complained of general malaise, loss of appetite and mild consciousness disturbance. Laboratory tests revealed a severely elevated eosinophil ratio (26.2%) and low sodium value (122 mmol/l). Endocrine system tests revealed that the patients adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 4.5 pg/ml) and cortisol (0.1 µg/dl) levels were lower than normal, while those of other pituitary hormones were higher than normal. This case was therefore diagnosed as isolated ACTH deficiency induced by nivolumab. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal pituitary glands. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy improved the clinical symptoms early and enabled the patient to restart nivolumab therapy. Isolated ACTH deficiency due to nivolumab, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, is a rare occurrence. This report may be useful for avoiding delays in the diagnosis and treatment of this life-threatening irAE even if no pituitary abnormalities are identified via MRI.",PD-L1,3

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy provides ready access to relevant tissue samples; however, the minute amounts of sample require sensitive multiplex molecular analysis to be of clinical biomarker utility. We have applied proximity extension assays (PEA) to analyze 167 proteins in FNA samples from patients with breast cancer (BC; n = 25) and benign lesions (n = 32). We demonstrate that the FNA BC samples could be divided into two main clusters, characterized by differences in expression levels of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the proliferation marker Ki67. This clustering corresponded to some extent to established BC subtypes. Our analysis also revealed several proteins whose expression levels differed between BC and benign lesions (e.g., CA9, GZMB, IL-6, VEGFA, CXCL11, PDL1, and PCD1), as well as several chemokines correlating with ER and Ki67 status (e.g., CCL4, CCL8, CCL20, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL17). Finally, we also identified three signatures that could predict Ki67 status, ER status, and tumor grade, respectively, based on a small subset of proteins, which was dominated by chemokines. To our knowledge, expression profiles of CCL13 in benign lesions and BC have not previously been described but were shown herein to correlate with proliferation (P = 0.00095), suggesting a role in advanced BC. Given the broad functional range of the proteins analyzed, immune-related proteins were overrepresented among the observed alterations. Our pilot study supports the emerging role of chemokines in BC progression. Due to the minimally traumatic sampling and clinically important molecular information for therapeutic decisions, this methodology is promising for future immunoscoring and monitoring of treatment efficacy in BC.© 2018 The Authors.

Regarding infectious complications, it has emerged that these compounds do not intrinsically increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections, which mainly correlate with the co-administration of systemic immunosuppressive therapy (high-dose corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factors inhibitors) to cure immune-related adverse events (colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and pancreatitis), well-known complications of these targeted drugs. These observations lead experts opinion to suggest primary anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis in patients undergoing CTLA-4 and PD-1/PDL1 agents who will receive prednisone 20 mg daily for ≥ 4 weeks. Few data on invasive fungal infections in this context are available. We report here a case of probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (p-IPA) complicating first-line immunotherapy with pembrolizumab for metastatic lung cancer that was further aggravated by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa superinfection of fungal cavities; the patient received concurrent systemic corticosteroid therapy as anti-edema treatment for cerebral metastases. Reviewing literature about Aspergillus diseases in subjects receiving CTLA-4 and PD-1 and PDL1-targeted agents, we found three cases of invasive aspergillosis and one case of exacerbation of chronic progressive pulmonary aspergillosis after nivolumab treatment; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of p-IPA complicating pembrolizumab immunotherapy.

Unlike the current therapies that target tumor cells, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy, ICIs directly restore the exhausted host antitumor immune responses mediated by the tumors. Among multiple immune modulators identified, the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis leading to the exhaustion of T-cell immunity in chronic infections and tumors has been widely investigated. Therefore, blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 have been developed and approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them the most successful ICIs. Compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy significantly improves the durable response rate and prolongs long-term survival with limited adverse effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy for advanced NSCLC. However, extensive challenges exist for further clinical applications, such as a small fraction of benefit population, primary and acquired resistance, the lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and treatment-related adverse effects. In this article, we summarize the latest clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide, as well as in China, and discuss the bottlenecks related to the use of this therapy in clinical practice. An exploration of the underlying mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and biomarker identification will maximize the application of ICIs in advanced NSCLC and facilitate bedside-to-bench studies in cancer immunotherapy as well. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) display apparent benefits for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical applications of these therapies are challenged by the limited benefit population with additional high economic burden and adverse events. This review discusses the bottlenecks of ICI therapy in clinical practice and provides appropriate guidance in the development of predictive biomarkers, the establishment of the criteria for combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy with the existing therapies, and the management of adverse events observed both in monotherapy and combination therapy, which will help maximize the applications of ICIs in advanced NSCLC.© AlphaMed Press 2019.",PD-L1,3

The recent emergence of immunotherapy treatment options, such as the use of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors, has also led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and has provided promising directions for the treatment of small cell lung cancer. This review provides a summary of the developmental process of immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer, ongoing international and domestic clinical trials in this field, and the challenges and considerations related to the use of immunotherapy in Chinese patients with lung cancer, with the aim of providing detailed information for future immunotherapy-related clinical trials in China. Research regarding immune checkpoint inhibitors in China is several years behind similar research in several developed countries. However, although PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-related clinical trials remain in their early stages in China, increased efforts by Chinese clinicians, researchers, and government staff have been directed toward trying to introduce novel drugs into the clinical setting. Because of the specific characteristics of Chinese patients with lung cancer (such as high epidermal growth factor receptor mutation rates, later disease stages, and different toxicity profiles), large-scale clinical trials targeting the Chinese population or Chinese participation in multinational trials should be promoted. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality, lung cancer is a major public health problem in China. Immunotherapy based on programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 checkpoint inhibitors may result in new treatment directions and a paradigm shift for Chinese patients with lung cancer. Although checkpoint inhibitor-related clinical trials remain in their early stages in China, increased efforts by Chinese clinicians, researchers, and government staff have been directed toward trying to introduce novel drugs into the clinical setting by encouraging the development of large-scale clinical trials targeting the Chinese population and promoting Chinese patients with lung cancer to participate in international trials.© AlphaMed Press 2019.",PD-L1,3

Whilst the field is rapidly evolving and the list of drugs receiving regulatory approval for the treatment of various cancers is fast growing, the group of PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors is establishing a leading role amongst immunomodulatory agents. PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors act against pathways involved in adaptive immune suppression resulting in immune checkpoint blockade. Within the last four years two PD-1 and three PD-L1 inhibitors have been utilized in clinical practice against a variety of malignancies. Focus was initially placed on targeting cancers considered immunogenic such as melanoma, renal and lung cancers but subsequently the application expanded to include amongst others Hodgkin Lymphoma, urothelial as well as head and neck cancer. This article provides a comprehensive review of the early and late phase trials that led to the regulatory approval of all five PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors in the corresponding cancer types. It presents available data on the combinations of PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors with other therapies (immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy), the toxicity profile of the PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors and ongoing trials testing the efficacy of these agents in cancer types beyond those that have been addressed already. Finally, current and future challenges in the application of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are discussed with emphasis on the role of predictive biomarkers.",PD-L1,3

Central nervous system metastases are a common complication of NSCLC and confer a poor prognosis and a dismal survival rate. Treatment is limited, has poor outcomes, and affects patient quality of life. Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 antibody that has shown good results for the management of NSCLC. However, its penetration of the central nervous system has not been well studied, and patients with untreated brain metastases are excluded from most clinical trials. Herein, we report two cases of NSCLC with brain metastases in patients successfully treated with pembrolizumab, and discuss the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in these patients. Pembrolizumab has shown good control and the patients have had long progression-free survival with a high quality of life. Neither patient has experienced serious or grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events. Pembrolizumab demonstrates activity in brain metastases in NSCLC patients with an acceptable safety profile. Thus, there may be a role for systemic immunotherapy in patients with untreated or progressive brain metastases.© 2019 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Dec 23.,Dynamics of blood neutrophil-related indices during nivolumab treatment may be associated with response to salvage chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer: A hypothesis-generating study.,"Several recent studies have shown that salvage chemotherapy following PD-1 blockade produces high antitumor activity in some patients with non-small lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the underlying synergistic mechanisms remain uncertain. The blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) can reflect the number of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated neutrophils. The immunosuppressive status of the tumor microenvironment could be monitored by the time-series patterns of NLR and ANC. The dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab treatment were retrospectively explored in 15 patients: 8 patients receiving subsequent salvage chemotherapy (2 groups: 3 non-responders and 5 responders), and 7 responders to nivolumab alone (2 groups: 4 partial response and 3 complete response). The dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab differed among these four groups (NLR P = 0.045, ANC P = 0.067). NLR and ANC during nivolumab treatment increased over time in non-responders to salvage chemotherapy, with an inverse relationship between drug response and NLR or ANC at four to six weeks among the four groups. We hypothesize that the early dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab may be associated with the late efficacy of subsequent salvage chemotherapy. Further studies involving a large cohort are needed to confirm these findings, which could provide insight into the role of myeloid immunosuppressor cells in combination PD-1 blockade and chemotherapy.© 2018 The Authors.

Because of the systemic nature and heterogeneity of tumoral diseases, as well as the immune restoration process induced by immunotherapy, the assessment of therapeutic efficacy is challenging, and the role of FDG PET is not well established. We evaluated the potential of FDG PET to monitor NSCLC patients treated with a checkpoint inhibitor. RESULTS: This was a retrospective analysis of 28 NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blocker. All patients underwent a PET scan before treatment (SCAN-1) and another scan 2 months later (SCAN-2). Disease progression was assessed by immune PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (iPERCIST), which was adapted from PERCIST; and the immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST). iPERCIST is a dual-time-point evaluation of unconfirmed progressive metabolic disease"" (UPMD) status at SCAN-2. UPMD at SCAN-2 was re-evaluated after 4 weeks with SCAN-3 to confirm PMD.

Melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells were shunted to the lung in the presence of the infection, where they expressed high levels of inflammation-induced cell-activation blocker PD-1, and became incapable of migrating back to the tumor site. At the same time, co-infection virus-specific CD8+ T cells remained functional while the infection was cleared. It was also unexpectedly found that PD-1 blockade immunotherapy reversed this effect. Here, we proceed to ground the experimental observations in a mechanistic immunobiochemical model that incorporates T cell pathways that control PD-1 expression. A core component of our model is a kinetic motif, which we call a PD-1 Double Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (DIFFL), and which reflects known interactions between IRF4, Blimp-1, and Bcl-6. The different activity levels of the PD-1 DIFFL components, as a function of the cognate antigen levels and the given inflammation context, manifest themselves in phenotypically distinct outcomes. Collectively, the model allowed us to put forward a few working hypotheses as follows: (i) the melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells re-circulating with the blood flow enter the lung where they express high levels of inflammation-induced cell-activation blocker PD-1 in the presence of infection; (ii) when PD-1 receptors interact with abundant PD-L1, constitutively expressed in the lung, T cells loose motility; (iii) at the same time, virus-specific cells adapt to strong stimulation by their cognate antigen by lowering the transiently-elevated expression of PD-1, remaining functional and mobile in the inflamed lung, while the infection is cleared. The role that T cell receptor (TCR) activation and feedback loops play in the underlying processes are also highlighted and discussed. We hope that the results reported in our study could potentially contribute to the advancement of immunological approaches to cancer treatment and, as well, to a better understanding of a broader complexity of fundamental interactions between pathogens and tumors.",PD-L1,3

Although immunotherapeutic agents generally have a favourable toxicity profile compared to chemotherapy, they can provoke immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) caused by an unregulated and hyperstimulated immune response. Some of these effects can be serious and life-threatening. AIMS: Our aim was to compare the utilisation of immunotherapy and the rates, management and outcomes of irAEs between a regional oncology service and a tertiary service. METHOD: We reviewed the medical records for all patients treated with immunotherapy in the participating services for the five year period from 31st July 2012 to 31st July 2017. RESULTS: Data demonstrated that rates of immunotherapy use are both similar and increasing across the tertiary and regional services. The rates, types and severity of irAEs are equivalent and in concordance with pre-existing literature. Immune-related adverse events appear to be identified and treated earlier in the regional service with corresponding reduction in the duration of immunosuppression and requirement for inpatient management. CONCLUSION: The use of immunotherapy in a regional setting is safe and equivalent to that of a tertiary centre. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",PD-L1,3

We hereby report a case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency developing in a patient with squamous cell lung cancer (SCC) during nivolumab therapy.Case: A 79-year-old man with SCC was started on nivolumab therapy as a fifth-line treatment after 4 lines of cytotoxic anticancer therapy. After 20 courses of nivolumab therapy, he had nausea, appetite loss, and difficulty walking. A close laboratory examination led to the diagnosis of isolated ACTH deficiency in this patient. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy led to amelioration of his symptoms and allowed him to continue with nivolumab therapy. The present case of isolated ACTH deficiency was characterized by a slowly progressive decline in the serum sodium level, which became manifest well before appearance of any clinical symptoms, suggesting that the serum sodium level may be used to predict progression to isolated ACTH deficiency.Thus, not only serum sodium levels need to be monitored in patients suspected of having isolated ACTH deficiency, but ACTH and cortisol levels need to be monitored in those exhibiting a decline in serum sodium levels.

However, a disruption of the immune checkpoint function by blocking PD-1/PD-ligand 1(PD-L1) signaling may trigger myasthenia gravis (MG) as a life-threatening immune-related adverse event. MG is a neuromuscular disease and is closely associated with being positive for anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) Abs, which are high specific and diagnostic Abs for MG. METHODS: A 72-year-old man was diagnosed with chemotherapy-refractory lung squamous cell carcinoma and nivolumab was selected as the third-line regimen. We describe the first report of an anti-AChR Ab-seropositive lung cancer patient achieving a durable complete response (CR) to an anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. To further explore this case, we performed multiplex immunofluorescence analysis on a pretreatment tumor. RESULTS: The patient achieved a durable CR without developing MG. However, the levels of anti-AChR Abs were elevated during two years of anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. The tumor of the subclinical MG patient had high PD-L1 expression and an infiltrated⁻inflamed tumor immune microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors can be safely used and provide the benefits for advanced cancer patients with immunologically hot tumor even if anti-AChR Abs are positive. Although careful monitoring clinical manifestation in consultation with neurologist is needed, immune checkpoint inhibitors should be considered as a treatment option for asymptomatic anti-AChR Ab-seropositive cancer patients.",PD-L1,3

However this has not been validated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer due to the difficulty to obtain serial biopsies. Measuring PD-L1 expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may allow real-time monitoring of immune activation in tumor. In this study, whole blood from non-metastatic NSCLC patients was collected before, during, and after radiation or chemoradiation using a microfluidic chip. PD-L1 expression in CTCs was assessed by immunofluorescence and qPCR and monitored through the course of treatment. Overall, PD-L1(+) CTCs were detected in 25 out of 38 samples (69.4%) with an average of 4.5 cells/ml. After initiation of radiation therapy, the proportion of PD-L1(+) CTCs increased significantly (median 0.7% vs. 24.7%, P < 0.01), indicating up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells in response to radiation. In addition, patients positive for PD-L1 (≥5% of CTCs positive for PD-L1) at baseline had shorter PFS. Gene expression analysis revealed that higher levels of PD-L1 were associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, CTCs can be used to monitor dynamic changes of PD-L1 during radiation therapy which is potentially prognostic of response to treatment.",PD-L1,3

However, only a quarter of patients benefit from this therapy with objective clinical response. In this context, there is an unmet need for improved understanding of resistance mechanisms. Thus, we studied a prospective cohort of mNSCLC (n = 61) treated in second or third-line with nivolumab. We analyzed various blood myeloid and lymphoid markers by flow cytometry (176 variables) at baseline, and after 15 and 30 days of therapy. By attempting to link the evolution of peripheral lymphoid, myeloid cells and anti-PD-1 response, we observed that accumulation of lymphoid cells and monocytic MDSC (mMDSC) expressing, respectively, Tim-3 and galectin-9 is implicated in resistance to PD-1 blockade both for patients with primary or acquired secondary resistance to anti-PD-1. In vitro, anti-Tim-3 blocking antibody reverses resistance to anti-PD-1 in PBMC from lung cancer patients and high levels of blood mMDSC negatively impact on anti-PD-1 efficacy. Together, these data underline that the galectin-9/Tim-3 pathway and mMDSC are key mechanisms of primary or secondary resistance to anti-PD-1 and could be a new target for immunotherapy drug combinations.",PD-L1,3

This study investigated the immune response to MTB infection on lung metastasis in lung cancer cells via T cell-mediated immune response. To clarify this problem, we analyzed the expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and immune function in antigen-specific T cell as derived from MTB patients or spleen lymphocytes derived from wild-type and PD-1 knockout mice with MTB antigen stimulation and Lewis lung cancer cells injection. Our data indicate that the expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 were elevated in active pulmonary TB patients, as well as in mice received MTB and lung cancer cells treatment. We also observed the T cell-mediated cellular immune response were inhibited by MTB while MTB significantly promote tumor metastasis in lung. In conclusion, the PD-1/PD-L pathway is required MTB repressed T-cell immune response and promotes tumor metastasis.

PD-1 blocking antibodies constitute an essential treatment option for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors in lymphangioleiomyomatosis patients with non-small cell lung cancer is unknown: concomitant symptomatic interstitial lung disease or the use of immunosuppressors was a key exclusion criterion in the original studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially regarding the risk of interstitial lung disease exacerbation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old female, active smoker (36 pack-years), diagnosed with sporadic LAM since 2004 suffered from metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. Third-line therapy with nivolumab was started in 2015, with a major partial response. Due to pulmonary function alterations, sirolimus was also reinitiated in 2017 in conjunction with nivolumab, without any undesirable effects and a major partial response continuing up to May 2018. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the safe and effective use of nivolumab for managing metastatic lung adenocarcinoma that occurred in a patient with sporadic LAM. In the current case, immunotherapy proved highly successful in managing the NSCLC tumor that occurred upon LAM follow-up, with both a significantly prolonged partial response and acceptable safety profile.",PD-L1,3

Here, we analysed two different types of tissue microarrays of healthy lymphatic and various inflamed tissues, colorectal and lung cancers, as well as >1700 tumour samples from 86 different tumour entities for TIGIT and/or PD-1 by bright field and/or multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry. TIGIT was detected in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ T helper cells, FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, and NK cells, but not in CD11c+ dendritic cells, CD68+ macrophages, and CD20+ B lymphocytes. TIGIT expression paralleled that of PD-1. More than 70% of TIGIT+ cells were PD-1+, and more than 90% of the PD-1+ cells were TIGIT+. Expression varied between different tissue compartments. TIGIT expression in tonsil gradually increased from the interfollicular area over the marginal/mantle zone to the germinal centre in all T cell subtypes. In inflammatory diseases, the strongest expression of TIGIT/PD-1 was found in Hashimoto thyroiditis. TIGIT+ lymphocytes were seen in all 86 different tumour entities with considerable high variability of TIGIT positivity within and between different cancer entities. Particularly, high densities of TIGIT+ lymphocytes were, for example, seen in squamous cell cancers of various origins. In summary, the variable expression levels of TIGIT and PD-1 in cell types and tissue compartments illustrate the high complexity of immune microenvironments.

[Epub ahead of print],JAK/STAT inhibition with ruxolitinib enhances oncolytic virotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer models.,"The concept of using viruses to treat cancer has now shown proof of concept in several recent clinical trials, leading to the first FDA approval of virotherapy for melanoma last year. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a promising oncolytic virus that has inhibitory effects on a number of cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer. One of the major mechanisms of resistance to VSV infection is the type I interferon (IFN) response, leading to the development of VSV expressing IFNβ which will lead to resistance of viral replication in normal cells which have intact IFN signaling but allow replication in cancer cells with defective IFNβ signaling. However, some cancer cells have intact or partially intact IFN signaling pathways leading to resistance to virotherapy. Here we utilized JAK/STAT inhibitor, ruxolitinib, in combination with VSV-IFNβ to see if inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling will enhance VSV-IFNβ therapy for lung cancer. We used five human and two murine NSCLC cell lines in vitro, and the combination treatment was assayed for cytotoxicity. We performed western blots on treated cells to see the effects of ruxolitinib on JAK/STAT signaling and PDL-1 expression in treated cells. Finally, the combination of VSV-IFNβ and ruxolitinib was tested in an immune competent murine model of NSCLC. Ruxolitinib enhanced virotherapy in resistant and sensitive NSCLC cells. The addition of ruxolitinib inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation and to a lesser extent STAT3 phosphorylation. Ruxolitinib treatment prevented NSCLC cells from enhancing PDL-1 expression in response to virotherapy. Combination ruxolitinib and VSV-IFNβ therapy resulted in a trend toward improved survival of mice without substantially effecting PDL-1 levels or levels of immune infiltration into the tumor. These results support further clinical evaluation of the combination of JAK/STAT inhibition with virotherapy.",PD-L1,3

We herein evaluated 22C3-PD-L1 expression of NSCLC in a single institution experience and compared it with clinicopathologic features. Materials and methods: We assessed 22C3-PD-L1 expressions of 411 patients with NSCLC from our institution, including in past specimens. Programmed death-ligand 1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing was performed using the PD-L1 clone 22C3 pharmDx kit (Agilent Technologies/Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA).

Results: In all, 137 patients (33%) did not express PD-L1, 155 (38%) showed low expression, and 119 (29%) demonstrated high expression. Archival samples showed lower PD-L1 expression than that of recent samples, and the ratios of no expression case significantly increased by using paraffin blocks embedded particularly in more than 4 years ago. Programmed death-ligand 1 positivity was significantly associated with male sex, smoking, higher tumor grade, squamous cell carcinoma in histologic type, wild-type EGFR, and ALK rearrangement positive.

METHODS: Two cohorts of lung cancer patients with BM were analyzed. Cohort 1 included 18 patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab, and intra- and extracranial responses were assessed. Cohort 2 comprised 20 patients who underwent both primary lung surgery and brain metastasectomy. Specimens from cohort 2 were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for the following markers: CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, and PD-1 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and PD-L1 on tumor cells. RESULTS: Seven patients (38.9%) in cohort 1 showed progressive disease in both primary and intracranial lesions. Although the other 11 patients exhibited a partial response or stable disease in the primary lesion, eight showed a progression in BM. Interestingly, PD-1+ TILs were significantly decreased in BM (P = 0.034). For fifteen patients with adenocarcinoma, more distinctive patterns were observed in CD3+ (P = 0.078), CD8+ (P = 0.055), FOXP3+ (P = 0.016), and PD-1+ (P = 0.016) TILs. CONCLUSIONS: There may be discordant responses to an ICI of lung cancer between primary lung lesion and BM based on discrepancies in the tumor microenvironment. The diminished infiltration of PD-1+ TILs in tumor tissue within the brain may be one of the major factors that hinder the response to anti-PD-1 antibody in BM.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Nov 30.,Enhancing Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitory Cancer Therapy by CD276-Targeted Photodynamic Ablation of Tumor Cells and Tumor Vasculature.,"Antiangiogenic therapies have been demonstrated to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition by overcoming the immunosuppressive status of the tumor microenvironment. However, most of the current antiangiogenic agents cannot discriminate tumor angiogenesis from physiological angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent that targets CD276, a receptor overexpressed in various tumor cells and tumor vasculature but with limited expression in normal tissue vasculature, could improve the tumor inhibitory efficacy of a PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. A CD276-targeting agent (IRD-αCD276/Fab) was synthesized by conjugating the Fab fragment of an anti-CD276 antibody with a photosensitizer IRDye700. The in vivo tumor-targeting efficacy and therapeutic effects of IRD-αCD276/Fab with or without an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade were tested in subcutaneous and lung metastatic tumor models. PDT using IRD-αCD276/Fab significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous 4T1 tumor and inhibited its lung metastasis. Moreover, it triggered in vivo antitumor immunity by increasing the activation and maturation of dendritic cells. Tumor PD-L1 levels were also markedly increased after PDT using IRD-αCD276/Fab, as evidenced by noninvasive PD-L1-targeted small-animal PET imaging. In combination with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, IRD-αCD276/Fab PDT markedly suppressed the growth of tumors and prevented their metastasis to the lung by recruiting the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Our data provide evidence for the role of CD276-targeted PDT for local immune modulation, and its combination with PD-L1/PD-1 axis inhibition is a promising strategy for eliminating primary tumors as well as disseminated metastases, by generating local and systemic antitumor responses.",PD-L1,3

It has been reported to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon, skin, lung, gastric or bladder cancer. SFN is supposed to act primarily as an antioxidant due to the activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway. This enhances the activity of phase II detoxifying enzymes and the trapping of free radicals. Finally, SFN induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis of tumor cells. Here, we discuss effects of SFN on the immune defense system. In contrast to the situation in tumor cells, SFN acts pro-oxidatively in primary human T cells.

But all that glitters is not gold and there is an increasing number of reports of adverse effects while using immune-checkpoint inhibitors. While chemotherapy could weaken the immune system, this novel immunotherapy could hyper-activate it, resulting in a unique and distinct spectrum of adverse events, called immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). IRAEs, ranging from mild to potentially life-threatening events, can involve many systems, and their management is radically different from that of cytotoxic drugs: immunosuppressive treatments, such as corticoids, infliximab or mycophenolate mofetil, usually result in complete reversibility, but failing to do so can lead to severe toxicity or even death.

The pivotal trials consistently showed a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients with driver mutation-negative NSCLC, a field in which outcomes had been stagnant for decades. The success of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in NSCLC has led to enthusiasm to expand the reach of these drugs into other thoracic malignancies such as thymic epithelial tumors (TETs), mesothelioma, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Unfortunately, the improvement in outcomes with ICI therapy in these rarer thoracic tumors has been somewhat modest, and in the case of thymoma, rates of adverse events are too high to routinely justify their use. Although the response rates seen in ICI therapy in these tumor types are similar to those seen with other available single-agent therapies for advanced disease, ICIs do present another option for clinicians treating patients with mesothelioma, small cell carcinoma, and thymic carcinoma (TC), diseases in which approved treatment options are limited.

Ann Oncol. 2019 Jan 1;30(1):44-56. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdy495.,Development of tumor mutation burden as an immunotherapy biomarker: utility for the oncology clinic.,"Background: Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with agents such as anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and/or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) can result in impressive response rates and durable disease remission but only in a subset of patients with cancer. Expression of PD-L1 has demonstrated utility in selecting patients for response to ICB and has proven to be an important biomarker for patient selection. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is emerging as a potential biomarker. However, refinement of interpretation and contextualization is required. Materials and methods: In this review, we outline the evolution of TMB as a biomarker in oncology, delineate how TMB can be applied in the clinic, discuss current limitations as a diagnostic test, and highlight mechanistic insights unveiled by the study of TMB. We review available data to date studying TMB as a biomarker for response to ICB by tumor type, focusing on studies proposing a threshold for TMB as a predictive biomarker for ICB activity. Results: High TMB consistently selects for benefit with ICB therapy. In lung, bladder and head and neck cancers, the current predictive TMB thresholds proposed approximate 200 non-synonymous somatic mutations by whole exome sequencing (WES). PD-L1 expression influences response to ICB in high TMB tumors with single agent PD-(L)1 antibodies; however, response may not be dependent on PD-L1 expression in the setting of anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination therapy. Disease-specific TMB thresholds for effective prediction of response in various other malignancies are not well established. Conclusions: TMB, in concert with PD-L1 expression, has been demonstrated to be a useful biomarker for ICB selection across some cancer types; however, further prospective validation studies are required. TMB determination by selected targeted panels has been correlated with WES. Calibration and harmonization will be required for optimal utility and alignment across all platforms currently used internationally. Key challenges will need to be addressed before broader use in different tumor types.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Sep 21.,"Patient and physician preferences for first-line treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in Germany, France and the United Kingdom.","First-line treatments for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) include ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) and BEACOPPescalated (escalated dose bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone). To further improve overall outcomes, positron emission tomography-driven strategies and ABVD or BEACOPP variants incorporating the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (BV) or anti-PD1 antibodies are under investigation in advanced-stage patients. The present study aimed to elicit preferences for attributes associated with ABVD, BEACOPPescalated and BV-AVD (BV, adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) among patients and physicians. Cross-sectional online discrete choice experiments were administered to HL patients (n = 381) and haematologists/oncologists (n = 357) in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Included attributes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the risk of neuropathy, lung damage, infertility and hospitalisation due to adverse events. Whereas 5-year PFS and OS were the most important treatment attributes to patients, the relative importance of each attribute and preference weights for each level varied among physicians according to the description of the hypothetical patient for whom treatment was recommended. PFS and OS most strongly influenced physicians recommendations when considering young female patients who did not want children or young male patients. Infertility was more important to physicians treatment decision than PFS when considering young women with unknown fertility preferences, whereas hospitalisations due to adverse events played the largest role in treatment decisions for older patients.© 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Aug 4.,EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer: an updated review of clinical trials and new perspectives in biomarkers analysis.,"Lung cancer still represents one of the most common and fatal neoplasm, accounting for nearly 30% of all cancer-related deaths. Targeted therapies based on molecular tumor features and programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) blockade immunotherapy have offered new therapeutic options for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-pathway promotes tumor growth and progression, including angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and inhibition of apoptosis, providing a strong rationale for targeting this pathway. EGFR expression is detected in up to 85% of NSCLC and has been demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis. Two approaches for blocking EGFR signaling are available: prevention of ligand binding to the extracellular domain with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity with small molecules. There is a strong rationale to consider the tumors level of EGFR expression as one of the most significant predictive biomarkers in this setting. In this paper we provide an update focusing on the current status of EGFR-directed mAbs use for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC, through a review of all clinical trials involving anti-EGFR mAbs in combination with chemotherapy (CT) for advanced disease and with chemo-radiotherapy for stage III disease. Here we also discuss the current status of predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR mAbs when added to first-line CT in patients with advanced NSCLC. Finally, we focused on the relevance of EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)+ and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-Score ≥ 200 as predictive biomarkers for the selection of patients who would be most likely to derive a clinical benefit from treatment with CT in combination with anti-EGFR mAbs, with particular reference also to histology.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Sep 24.,Immune Microenvironment Differences Between Squamous and Non-squamous Non-small-cell Lung Cancer and Their Influence on the Prognosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Checkpoint blockades have entered routine clinical use for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there were some differences in efficacy and response predictors for anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies between squamous (SQ) and nonsquamous (non-SQ) NSCLC. The study aims to elucidate the possible difference in immune microenvironment between SQ-NSCLC and non-SQ-NSCLC and their influence on the prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 197 patients with stages I to III NSCLC were included. cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression were examined in cancer nest and stroma on 85 SQ-NSCLC and 112 non-SQ-NSCLC samples using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: More CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were detected in the cancer nests (cCD8) from patients with SQ-NSCLC than those with non-SQ-NSCLC (56% vs. 34%; P = .002). There were no significant differences between the SQ and non-SQ groups in terms of other TIL markers or PD-L1 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that the degree of cCD8+ TIL infiltration was an independent positive predictor for overall survival (OS) in the SQ-NSCLC group (P = .003) and in the non-SQ-NSCLC group (P = .024). In the univariate analysis, CD8+ TILs in the stroma, CD4+ TILs in the cancer nest and stroma, and FOXP3+ TILs in the cancer stroma associated with different prognoses for patients with either non-SQ-NSCLC or SQ-NSCLC. Using a 10% cutoff, PD-L1 expression was a poor prognostic factor in total NSCLC (P = .011), stage I (P = .037), SQ-NSCLC (P = .097), and non-SQ-NSCLC (P = .051). CONCLUSION: The different cCD8+ TIL profile and different prognostic value with certain TILs indicates that SQ-NSCLC and non-SQ-NSCLC are likely different cancer types with respect to their immune microenvironments.",PD-L1,3

We evaluated the correlation between immune-related adverse events (irAE) and treatment interruption due to irAE on clinical efficacy of PD-1 Ab in advanced NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Advanced NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 Ab between June 2015 to November 2017 at BC Cancer were identified. Demographic, tumor, treatment details, and frequency and grade (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) of irAE were abstracted from chart review. Kaplan-Meier curves of OS from initiation of PD-1 Ab were generated. Multivariable analysis with 6- and 12-week landmark analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: In a cohort of 271 patients, irAEs were observed in 116 patients (42.8%). Nivolumab recipients developing colitis had lower OS compared to those who did not at the 6-week landmark (P = .010) and 12-week landmark (P = .072). For the entire cohort, 56 patients (20.7%) needed treatment interruption because of an irAE. Treatment interruption correlated with lower OS at the 6-week landmark (P = .005) and 12-week landmark (P = .008). Six-week landmark multivariable analysis identified Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 3 or higher, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 2 or higher, presence of liver metastases, and irAE greater than grade 2 versus no irAE to be associated with decreased OS (each P < .05). CONCLUSION: Treatment interruption due to irAE was associated with a lower median OS compared to continuous PD-1 Ab therapy. Shorter OS seen with severe irAE might reflect the need for improved physician education in irAE treatment algorithms.",PD-L1,3

The novel immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) presents as the therapeutic Holly Grail in lung cancer treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Preclinical models provide evidence of immunotherapy-radiotherapy (IM-RT) synergy. The exposure to ionizing radiation turns tumor in an in-situ vaccine, primes the innate immune system, increases immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of immune-resistant tumors and promotes a systemic, out-of-field antitumor T-cell-mediated response called abscopal effect. The immunomodulatory and abscopal effects of radiotherapy can be further enhanced by combining with systemic immunotherapies. The phase III START trial proved that liposomal vaccine - tecemotide (L-BLP25) administered as maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in LA-NSCLC prolongs survival. In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. SUMMARY: PACIFIC trial results are expected to definitely establish durvalumab as standard consolidation strategy in LA-NSCLC. Many clinical trials are ongoing in the field of immunoradiotherapy in LA-NSCLC to define the optimal conditions for this therapeutic combination.",PD-L1,3

For patients with chemorefractory gastroesophageal cancer, treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy results in modest benefits in overall survival; nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been licenced in Japan and the USA, respectively, for this indication. However, initial enthusiasm has been tempered by the results of several large negative trials; immune checkpoint blockade is not superior to chemotherapy in the second-line setting or beyond in unselected or low PD-L1-expressing patients. Microsatellite instability is uncommon in patients with metastatic gastric cancer; however, it is associated with response rates of more than 50% and long-term survival benefit. Combining anti-PD-1 with cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies also shows promise to extend the benefit of immune checkpoint blockade to a larger proportion of gastroesophageal cancer patients. In this review we discuss recently reported and ongoing clinical research in immunotherapy for gastroesophageal cancer, and consider molecular biology associated with sensitivity and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in gastroesophageal cancer patients.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Dec 7.,Human leukocyte antigen variation is associated with adverse events of checkpoint inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibitors (CIs) are highly effective but can induce severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which cannot be predicted. We investigated whether human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes predispose to developing of irAEs during therapy and thus hold a predictive role. METHODS: We established a prospective observational single-centre study and collected data from patients with either metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic melanoma, who were treated with anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death receptor 1), anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) or both CIs combined. Data include irAEs and ranges from 15th July 2016 until 10th May 2018. In addition, we performed HLA typing via next generation sequencing. RESULTS: We enrolled 102 patients (median [range] age, 68 [62-74] years) with metastatic cancer in our study who received CI therapy. Of these patients, 59 (58%) developed one or more irAEs, among which pruritus (n = 32 (54%)) and rash (n = 24 (41%)) had the highest rates. We did not find evidence for a single HLA gene being associated with all irAEs (all P > .05). When assessing each irAE individually, we found a significant association between HLA-DRB1*11:01 and pruritus (OR = 4.53, X21,95 = 9.45, P < .01) as well as a nominally significant additive association between HLA-DQB1*03:01 and colitis (OR = 3.94, X21,95 = 5.67, P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of two HLA alleles that are known to predispose to autoimmune diseases were associated with the development of pruritus or colitis during therapy, suggesting a genetic aetiology of irAEs. Larger genome-wide association studies should be performed to confirm our findings.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 May 28.,FOXP3 infiltrating lymphocyte density and PD-L1 expression in operable non-small cell lung carcinoma.,"Purpose/Aim: Regulatory FOXP3+ T-cells control the cytotoxic activity of effector cells and may have an essential role in the development of immune tolerance in cancer patients. Programed death ligand 1 PD-L1, expressed on cancer cell membranes also blocks the cytotoxic activity of PD1+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. Materials and Methods: We assessed the immunohistochemical detection of these immune-tolerance related markers in a series of 98 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) treated with surgery. The Tumor Infiltration Lymphocyte TIL density (mean number per x400 optical field) and the percentage of FOXP3+ TILs were assessed. Results: PD-L1 expression was directly linked with the TIL density (p = 0.01) and with the extent of infiltration with FOXP3+ TILs, named as the FIL-score (p = 0.01). FIL-score was significantly higher in stage I disease (p = 0.04). IL6 expression was linked with high TIL-score. A low TIL-score, characterizing immune deficient tumors defined a significantly poorer prognosis subgroup of patients (p = 0.03). Stratification of these tumors according to the FIL-score showed that FOXP3 expression by TILs correlated with an even a poorer prognosis in univariate (p = 0.007; median survival 14 vs. 44 months, respectively) and in multivariate analysis (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 4.3). Conclusion: Tumor stroma infiltration by FOXP3+ Tregs is an early event in the progression of NSCLC. Low lymphocytic infiltration defines poor prognosis, which becomes worse when the small numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes characterizing these tumors contain FOXP3 + Tregs. Furthermore, the direct association of FOXP3+ Treg infiltration density with PD-L1 expression by cancer cells implies a co-ordinated immune-suppressive activity in NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

Nab-paclitaxel was developed to reduce the toxicities associated with solvent-bound paclitaxel (sb-paclitaxel). Areas covered: This review first focuses on the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of nab-paclitaxel in NSCLC at different settings. The approval of nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin at the front-line setting for advanced NSCLC was based on the key phase III study, which showed that nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin was associated with superior overall response rate and favorable toxicity profile compared to sb-paclitaxel/carboplatin. The review also addresses the nab-paclitaxel pharmacology, other combinations (e.g. immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), potential biomarkers (e.g. caveolin-1), and special subgroups (e.g. the elderly, squamous histology). Expert opinion: Existing data has established the role of nab-paclitaxel in the management of advanced NSCLC. Emerging evidence, such as preliminary results from Keynote-407 and IMpower 131 studies, indicates that novel combinations of nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors could further improve clinical benefits with manageable toxicity. Nevertheless, in order to better position nab-paclitaxel and to improve patient selection, future studies are warranted to further understand its mechanism of action, predictive biomarkers, and potential synergism with other agents.",PD-L1,3

Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, with radiation indicated for areas at high risk for recurrence. When surgical and radiation options have been exhausted, the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy is poor. No biologic or targeted agents have been approved for the management of advanced or recurrent vulvar cancer. Pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 (PD-1), has been successfully used as a target of tumor immune therapy in small cell lung cancer and melanoma. We present the first case in the literature of a patient with recurrent vulvar cancer who was treated successfully with pembrolizumab. Caris next-generation testing revealed a PD-L1 and PD-1 mutation (PD-L1 positive, 2+, 100%). She attained a complete clinical remission after 2 cycles, and a CT scan after 6 cycles revealed a significant response by RECIST criteria. After completing 10 cycles, treatment was stopped due to complications of severe malnutrition related to narcotic abuse. A CT scan 10 weeks after the final treatment revealed no adenopathy.

The aim of our study is to assess the analytical performance of laboratory-developed tests for Ventana SP263 and Agilent/Dako 22C3, and to investigate the association between PD-L1 assays and response to PD-1/L1 inhibitors. METHODS AND RESULTS: PD-L1 SP263 and 22C3 assays were performed on 302 consecutive non-small-cell lung carcinoma samples Both assays were optimised for use on the automated Ventana BenchMark Ultra platform. Scoring algorithms for staining of the tumour cells using the established cut-offs were applied to all samples. Best overall response (BOR) for 44 patients treated with either nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab were assessed using recist version 1.1 and correlated with PD-L1 assay results. Assays showed good agreement, with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-0.90)]. Comparing the assays using cut-offs of 1%, 5%, 10%, 1-49% and ≥50% showed an association between the two assays (P < 0.0001). The SP263 10% cut-off (P = 0.032) was associated with BOR, whereas the 1% (P = 0.087) and 5% (P = 0.051) cut-offs were not. In contrast 22C3, cut-offs of 1% (P = 0.019), 5% (P = 0.025) and 10% (P = 0.014) were all associated with BOR.

But complete and long-lasting efficacy is only observed in a fraction of the patient population. One of the suspected causes is the inability of cytotoxic T cells, endowed with tumor killing ability, to reach their malignant targets. Using dynamic fluorescence imaging to study the dynamic of T cells in tumors from patients with lung cancer, we have recently demonstrated that macrophages trap the T lymphocytes, which are not longer able to contact the tumor cells. In murine models of breast cancer, we could show that the depletion of macrophages allows T cells to interact with tumor cells, a process which enhances anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings illustrate the relevance of current clinical trials combining a strategy that deplete or modulate macrophages with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

Herein we describe pharmacological studies in mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and in human primary cells which support the development of DV281, a C-class CpG-ODN, as an inhaled aerosolized immunotherapeutic for lung cancer to be combined with an inhibitor of the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‑1) immune checkpoint. In vitro, DV281 potently induced Interferon (IFN)‑α from monkey and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), stimulated interleukin‑6 production and proliferation in human B cells, and induced TLR9-dependent cytokine responses from mouse splenocytes. Intranasal delivery of DV281 to mice led to substantial but transient cytokine and chemokine responses in the lung. Lung responses to repeated intranasal DV281 were partially to fully reversible 2 weeks after the final dose and were absent in TLR9-deficient mice. Single escalating doses of aerosolized DV281 in monkeys induced dose-dependent induction of IFN-regulated genes in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and blood. In a repeat-dose safety study in monkeys, inhaled DV281 was well-tolerated, and findings were mechanism of action-related and non-adverse. Co-culture of human PBMC with DV281 and anti-PD‑1 antibody did not augment cytokine or cellular proliferation responses compared to DV281 alone, indicating that the combination did not lead to dysregulated cytokine responses. These studies support clinical development of inhaled aerosolized DV281 as a combination therapy with anti-PD‑1 antibody for lung cancer immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

Different therapeutic strategies for ovarian carcinoma have evolved over the years. Already 30 years ago, the first clinical studies focused on modulating the tumor cytokine network with special attention to interferon-mediated immune responses. With the exploration of specific tumor antigens such as NY-ESO-1, which is expressed in ovarian carcinoma and other malignancies, the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines has been pursued initiating the era of personalized anti-cancer medicine. Almost at the same time, the adoptive transfer of genetically modified autologous tumor-reactive T-cells occurred, but response rates in ovarian carcinoma were disappointing. Today, probably the most promising therapeutic approach in this context is the blockade of immune checkpoints, such as programed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and one of its ligands (PD-L1) or cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which has demonstrated impressive response rates in malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Despite increasing availability of treatment approaches that target tumor immune surveillance in ovarian carcinoma, selecting patient groups that particularly benefit from these treatment modalities is clinically challenging as predictive biomarkers are lacking. Here, we summarize different immunotherapy approaches in ovarian cancer and discuss why immunotherapy in ovarian cancer is still in its infancy.© IGCS and ESGO 2019. No commercial re-use.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the expressions of MALAT1, miR-200a-3p and PD-L1 in NSCLC tissues and cells for the correlation analysis. The starBase and Targetscan databases were used to predict the binding sites between MALAT1 and miR-200a-3p, and miR-200a-3p and PD-L1, respectively. The targeting relationship between MALAT1 and miR-200a-3p, and miR-200a-3p and PD-L1 were further verified by real-time PCR and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Cell proliferation was monitored by CCK8 and colony formation assays. The apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were conducted to determine cell migration and invasion. In this study, we demonstrated that in NSCLC tissues, the expression level of MALAT1 was negatively correlated with that of miR-200a-3p, while positively correlated with PD-L1. Besides, MALAT1 promoted proliferation, mobility, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells via sponging miR-200a-3p. PD-L1 was validated as a target of miR-200a-3p, and indirectly modulated by MALAT1.

Besides, there was no remarkable difference in the frequency of PD-1+CD8+ cells between patients and healthy controls. After chemotherapy, the levels of CD8+ lymphocytes, NK, Th2, Th17, and Treg were declined, in contrast to the level of Th1 cells which was markedly increased. Importantly, chemotherapy had no impact on the frequencies of PD-1+CD8+ and PD-1+CD4+ cells. PFS was significantly better in patients with low percentage of PD-1+CD4+ T cells than those with high percentage. Patients with high content of Th1 cells showed longer PFS than those with low content. The low percentages of Th17 and Treg cells were correlated with longer PFS, even though the difference did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, the imbalance of lymphocyte subsets is a hallmark of NSCLC. Furthermore, the high level of PD-1+CD4+ cells plays a crucial role in the progression of NSCLC and could be used as a prognostic marker; and the high level of Th1 could predict better clinical outcomes of chemotherapy.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Sep 15.,The Impact of Radiation Therapy on Lymphocyte Count and Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients Receiving PD-1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.,"PURPOSE: Therapeutic radiation has conflicting immune effects: radiation therapy (RT)-induced immunogenic cell death can contribute to immune response, but lymphocytes are also sensitive to RT. It is unknown whether palliative RT leads to lymphopenia in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and whether this affects outcomes. As such, we sought to assess the impact of palliative RT on circulating lymphocyte count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients being treated with PD-1-directed ICI and associations with survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified patients from 5 radiation oncology centers, treated with palliative RT and either pembrolizumab or nivolumab with non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Patients who received intervening cytotoxic chemotherapy were excluded. We recorded absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio before and after palliative RT and at the start of ICI. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients received 225 courses of palliative RT. Median change in ALC after RT was -161 cells/mL. Decreases in ALC were greater with RT to the spine, lung/mediastinum, and chest wall compared with the brain, extremity, or abdomen/pelvis (P = .002) and after courses >5 fractions (P = .003). Extracranial and >5-fraction RT was associated with increased odds of severe lymphopenia (ALC <500) at the end of RT (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; P = .001; and OR, 3.9; P = .001, respectively). Patients who developed RT-induced severe lymphopenia were more likely to have severe lymphopenia when ICI was initiated (OR, 6.4; P = .0001), particularly when RT was administered in the previous 3 months (OR, 189; P < .0001). Severe lymphopenia at onset of ICI therapy was associated with increased mortality on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.1; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Extracranial or prolonged courses of RT increase the risk of severe lymphopenia, which is associated with poorer survival in patients treated with ICI.",PD-L1,3

J BUON. 2019 Jan-Feb;24(1):11-19.,LungCARD - Report on worldwide research and clinical practices related to lung cancer.,"PURPOSE: The management of advanced lung cancer has evolved tremendously over the past two decades. Increasing understanding of the molecular changes that drive tumor progression has transformed the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless, various countries differ in the degree of implementation of genetic tests and the availability of innovative drugs. The LungCARD consortium created a questionnaire to collect information about the local research and clinical practices related to lung cancer diagnosis and therapy. METHODS: A survey composed of 37 questions related to specific lung cancer pharmacogenomics and therapy, was distributed among 18 countries. RESULTS: All together 36 responses were gathered, answered mainly by clinicians. The majority attends 50-200 cancer cases per month, 20-50% of all cancer cases are lung cancer patients, and more than 80% are with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapy is applied to 50% on average of all NSCLC patients. Forty five percent of participating medical oncologists are treating their patients with immunotherapy. More than 90% of the respondents are guided by results of genetic tests in introducing targeted treatment. As expected, the majority orders EGFR gene testing (85%), followed by ALK (58%) and KRAS testing (32%). Almost all (96%) agreed that more biomarkers should be included in routine genetic testing (ROS1, anti-PDL1, KRAS, MET, HER2, BRAF...), and that blood test is useful in pharmacogenomic testing. CONCLUSION: There is a great variation between countries with respect to all discussed topics. However, the majority recognized a necessity of introducing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics and potential of testing from blood. The biggest problem in the treatment of NSCLC is still an access to innovative drugs.",PD-L1,3

Materials and Methods: 1016 NSCLC mRNA-sequence samples from The Genome Data Analysis Center (TCGA) and 275 NSCLC mRNA-microarray samples from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were included as testing cohort and validation cohort respectively. Enrichment scores of CD8+ T cells metagene were used for quantifying its infiltrating density. Based on the median values of CD8+ T cell density and PD-1/PD-L1 mRNA expression, the samples were classified into four Tumor Immune Microenvironment types (TIMTs). Overall survival, as well as clinicopathological features, mutational profiles, mismatch repair score etc. were compared across the four types. Results: Neither PD-1 expression nor PD-L1 expression was associated with outcome in the overall NSCLC. Classification of TIMT based on PD-1/PD-L1 and CD8+ TIL could efficiently classify patients of different survival in ADC but not SCC, with the best overall survival achieved in TIMT3 (high CD8+ TIL and low PD-1/PD-L1), whereas TIMT2 (low CD8+ TIL and high PD-1/PD-L1) manifested the worst outcome. TIMT classification based on PD-1/ CD8+ TIL could better stratify patient of different prognosis than PD-L1/ CD8+ TIL based classification. EGFR wide type and IFNγ overexpression were associated with TIMT4 (high PD-1/PD-L1 and high CD8+ TIL), whereas tumor mutational burden (TMB) manifested no significant difference across four TIMTs. Conclusion: The classification of tumors into four microenvironment subtypes based on PD-1/PD-L1 status and CD8+ TIL is an appropriate approach to stratify patients of different clinical outcome and better guide the practical use of immunotherapy.",PD-L1,3

This work aimed to determine the predictive ability of FUT4 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) after curative resection, as well as to explore the role of a possible FUT4 molecular mechanism on LUAD malignant behavior. METHODS: A total of 273 LUAD patients after curative resection with complete clinicopathological and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort were collected. Correlation of FUT4 with overall survival (OS) was analyzed based on TCGA and further validated by online Kaplan-Meier Plotter"" database and IHC in 70 LUAD patients recruited in the First Hospital of China Medical University cohort. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and 1000 bootstrapping were performed to verify the predictive value of FUT4. Gene set enrichment assay (GSEA) was performed to investigate the biological characteristics. Correlation between PD-1 and FUT4 was analyzed based on TCGA cohort and validated by IHC on cohort from our hospital. RESULTS: Increased FUT4 expression led to reduced overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients based on TCGA (p = 0.006 and 0.001 for dichotomous and trichotomous modeling",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Oct 30.,Tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4 regulates PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are immune checkpoint proteins expressed in T cells. Although CTLA4 expression was found in multiple tumours including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cells, its function in tumour cells is unknown. Recently, PD-1 was found to be expressed in melanoma cells and to promote tumorigenesis. We found that CTLA4 was expressed in a subset of NSCLC cell lines and in a subgroup of cancer cells within the lung cancer tissues. We further found that in NSCLC cells, anti-CTLA4 antibody can induce PD-L1 expression, which is mediated by CTLA4 and the EGFR pathway involving phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. In CTLA4 knockout cells, EGFR knockout cells or in the presence of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, anti-CTLA4 antibody was not able to induce PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. Moreover, anti-CTLA4 antibody promoted NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo in the absence of adaptive immunity. These results suggest that tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4 can regulate PD-L1 expression and cell proliferation, and that anti-CTLA4 antibody, by binding to the tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4, may result in the activation of the EGFR pathway in cancer cells.© 2018 The Authors.

Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, often induce pneumonitis in patients with cancer; however, the tolerance and safety of nivolumab for advanced lung cancer with ILD are unclear. We report a 72-year-old patient with lung cancer with pathologically proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who was treated with nivolumab. She demonstrated pneumonitis with an organized pneumonia (OP) pattern, but no acute exacerbation of ILD featuring a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) pattern. She was successfully treated with corticosteroid therapy, and maintained good disease control after the discontinuation of nivolumab. She also showed pseudoprogression of the primary tumor, implying infiltration of T-cells into the lung. These findings suggest that T-cell activation by nivolumab treatment might not be directly associated with acute ILD exacerbation, and that treatable OP might be a major pulmonary complication of nivolumab in patients with pre-existing ILD, similar to patients without underlying ILD.",PD-L1,3

New promising therapies have emerged based on programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunity checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), including anti-PD-1, such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab. The prescription of pembrolizumab has been approved by FDA and EMA for advanced stages non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), restricted for first-line setting to patients whose tumor presents ≥50% of PD-L1 positive tumor cells (TC), and ≥1% for second-line and beyond, leading to consider PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic tool for pembrolizumab. Very recently, the EMA has approved durvalumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC not progressing after chemoradiotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 on ≥1% of TC. Four standardized PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays have been used in clinical trials; 22C3 and 28-8 PharmDx assays on Dako/Agilent platforms, and SP142 and SP263 assays on Ventana platforms, each test having been developed initially for a specific ICI. They differ in terms of primary monoclonal antibody, platform, detection system and scoring methods with different thresholds of positivity validated in clinical trials. Several studies have shown a close analytical performance of the 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 assays regarding TC staining in NSCLC, with poor concordance with SP142 assay and for immune cells. However, as dedicated platforms are not available in all pathology laboratories and because of the high cost of these assays, laboratory developed tests are widely used in many countries. Their validation must guarantee the same sensitivities and specificities as compared to standardized assays. Overall, PD-L1 test is of great help to select patients who could benefit for ICI and most pathologists have included this test in their daily practice for advanced stages NSCLC, besides ALK and ROS1 IHC.",PD-L1,3

However, despite the significant survival benefit for some patients with advanced NSCLC, the objective response rates (ORRs) remain relatively low no more than 20-30% with a large proportion of patients demonstrating primary resistance. Although the selection of NSCLC patients for the first-line treatment is currently guided by the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells as detected by immunohistochemistry, this is not the case for the second-line setting. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of PD-L1 expression is modest which has prompted the search for additional predictive biomarkers. In this context, the assessment of the tumor mutational burden (TMB), defined as the total number of nonsynonymous mutations in the coding regions of genes, has recently emerged as an additional powerful biomarker to select patients for immunotherapy. The purpose of our review is to highlight the recent advances as well as the challenges and perspectives in the field of TMB and immunotherapy for patients with NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

Recently, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade also has demonstrated interesting results in small trials of neoadjuvant treatment in stage IB to IIIA NSCLC. In addition, several clinical trials using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment in patients with resectable stage NSCLC are ongoing. However, few analyses of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy-related biomarkers in early-stage squamous cell lung carcinoma (SqCLC) have been reported. In this study, we evaluated PD-L1 protein expression, tumor mutation burden, and expression of an immune gene signature in early-stage SqCLC, providing data for identifying the potential role for patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in early-stage SqCLC. METHODS: A total of 255 specimens from patients with early-stage SqCLC were identified within participating centers of the Strategic Partnering to Evaluate Cancer Signatures program. PD-L1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry was evaluated by using the Dako PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx kit on the Dako Link 48 auto-stainer (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated on the basis of data from targeted genome sequencing. The T-effector and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene signature was determined from Affymetrix gene chip data (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) from frozen specimens. RESULTS: The prevalence of PD-L1 expression was 9.8% at a tumor proportion score cutoff of at least 50%. PD-L1 mRNA and programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 mRNA positively correlated with PD-L1 protein expression on tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 protein expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells was correlated with the T-effector and IFN-γ gene signature (p < 0.001), but not with TMB. For TCs, all of these biomarkers were independent of each other and neither PD-L1 protein expression, TMB, or T-effector and IFN-γ gene signatures were independently prognostic for patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of PD-L1 expression, TMB, and T-effector and IFN-γ gene signatures in the cohort with early-stage SqCLC found them to be independent of each other, and none was associated with overall survival. Our results also support the hypothesis that PD-L1 expression is regulated by an intrinsic mechanism on TCs and an adaptive mechanism on immune cells.",PD-L1,3

Systemic therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy should be provided to patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Applications of targeted therapy, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, in patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement has enabled dramatic improvements in efficacy and tolerability.

Epub 2018 Dec 4.,Haematological immune-related adverse events induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy: a descriptive observational study.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies are novel immunotherapies for cancer that can induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These adverse events can involve all organs, including the haemopoietic system. Thus far, haematological irAEs (haem-irAEs) have not been extensively characterised. This study aims to provide a comprehensive report of the haem-irAEs induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. METHODS: In this descriptive observational study, we included consecutive patients aged at least 18 years with grade 2 or worse haem-irAEs induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy registered in three French pharmacovigilance databases: the Registre des Effets Indésirables Sévères des Anticorps Monoclonaux Immunomodulateurs en Cancérologie (REISAMIC; a prospective registry of patients treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 at a single centre), the ImmunoTOX committee of Gustave Roussy (a national referral database of suspected irAEs in patients treated with immunotherapy), and the registry of the Centre de Référence des Cytopénies Auto-Immunes de lAdulte (CeReCAI; a national database of autoimmune cytopenias). Cases were reviewed by a central committee; adverse events had to be classed as certainly or probably related to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, and their severity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). The primary endpoint was clinical description of haem-irAEs, as reported in all databases, and their frequency, as reported in the prospective REISAMIC registry. FINDINGS: We screened 948 patients registered in the three databases from June 27, 2014, to June 29, 2018 (745 from REISAMIC, 190 from the ImmunoTOX committee, and 13 from CeReCAI). 35 patients (21 men and 14 women) with haem-irAEs related to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 were included in the study. Of 745 patients in the REISAMIC registry treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, four had haem-irAEs, giving a frequency of 0·5%. Median age in the 35 patients was 65 years (IQR 51-75), and the most common tumour types were melanoma (15 [43%] patients), non-small-cell lung cancer (12 [34%] patients), and lymphoma (four [11%] patients). 20 (57%) patients received nivolumab, 14 (40%) received pembrolizumab, and one (3%) received atezolizumab. Among the 35 patients, neutropenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and immune thrombocytopenia were the most common types of haem-irAE (each in nine patients [26%]), followed by pancytopenia or aplastic anaemia (five patients [14%]), bicytopenia (one patients with thrombocytopenia plus anaemia and one patient with neutropenia plus anaemia [6%]), and pure red cell aplasia (one patient [3%]). The maximum grade of severity was grade 2 in three (9%) patients, grade 3 in five (14%) patients, and grade 4 in 25 (71%) patients; two (6%) patients died from febrile neutropenia during haem-irAE related to anti-PD-1. Haem-irAEs resolved in 21 (60%) of the 35 patients. INTERPRETATION: Haem-irAEs induced by PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors are rare but potentially life-threatening events. The most common clinical presentations are neutropenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anaemia. Investigations into earlier detection and better management are warranted. FUNDING: Gustave Roussy and Gustave Roussy Immunotherapy Program.",PD-L1,3

It has remained unclear, however, whether cytotoxic chemotherapy affects the immune microenvironment in NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated changes in programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density in NSCLC patients who underwent rebiopsy at the site of recurrence after postoperative platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, or in those who underwent rebiopsy after one or more chemotherapeutic regimens at the advanced stage. The PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) and CD8+ TIL density were determined by immunohistochemistry. TMB was estimated by next-generation sequencing with a cancer gene panel (409 genes). RESULTS: Seventeen patients with NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK were enrolled. Although PD-L1 TPS tended to be increased in rebiopsy samples compared with initial biopsy tissue, this difference was not significant (P =  0.113). Seven patients showed an increase in PD-L1 TPS, with this change being pronounced in four. Two cases in which PD-L1 TPS increased from 0 to 90% or from 0 to 95% after cytotoxic chemotherapy also showed a durable response to subsequent treatment with an ICI. No substantial correlation between PD-L1 TPS and TMB was apparent either before (R = 0.112) or after (R = 0.101) chemotherapy. A moderate correlation was detected between PD-L1 TPS and CD8+ TIL density before chemotherapy (R = 0.517) and a negligible correlation after (R = 0.0219). CONCLUSION: Cytotoxic chemotherapy may change the biological characteristics of tumors including PD-L1 expression level and TMB.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2018 Nov 29.,The circulating pool of functionally competent NK and CD8+ cells predicts the outcome of anti-PD1 treatment in advanced NSCLC.,"INTRODUCTION: A prospective investigation of the circulating immune profile in NSCLC patients receiving nivolumab was performed to identify potentially predictive parameters. METHODS: Flow Cytometry of peripheral blood (PB) CD3+, CD8+, CD4+, NK, Treg and MDSCs was prospectively performed in 31 consecutive advanced NSCLC patients at baseline (T0) and after 2 (T1) and 4 (T2) cycles of bi-weekly nivolumab. Functional molecules (PD-1, CD3ζ, Granzyme B, Perforin), cell proliferation (Ki67) and NK receptors (NKG2 A, NKG2D, NKp30) were also explored. The immunohistochemical evaluation of PD-L1 and TILs was restricted to available tumor biopsies. Tissue and circulating parameters were correlated to clinico-pathological features and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: KRAS mutations, active smoking, COPD and steroid treatment conditioned a different distribution of circulating phenotypes. At baseline, clinical benefit (CB, n = 19) group displayed higher number of phenotypically active NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells (p < 0.01) compared to non-responders (NR, n = 12). Prolonged survival outcomes (p < 0.01) were recorded in cases with high baseline circulating NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells. At tissue level, low PD-1 expression in CD8 + TILs was a positive prognostic feature (p < 0.001). Strikingly, high circulating NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells combined with low PD-1/CD8+ ratio in TILs characterized a privileged context able to provide a significantly prolonged (p < 0.01) progression-free survival (PFS). During PD-1 blockade, NKs progressively raised in CB while declined in NR (p < 0.05) and this phenomenon was counterbalanced by parallel changes in Treg. CONCLUSION: The functional pool of circulating NKs associated with a divergent PD-1 expression in blood and tissue CD8+ lymphocytes portrays an immune profile predictive of anti-PD1 treatment efficacy.",PD-L1,3

In this era of cancer immunotherapy, humanized mouse models which recapitulate human immune system, are needed for predicting immunotherapy response in patients. We established a Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which can be used as a preclinical testing platform for assessing efficacy of different immunotherapeutic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model was established by engrafting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into NOD/scid/IL-2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice. Cytokine array was performed to assess serological similarity between patient and the Hu-PBL-NSG mouse, and microscopic immune cell infiltration was observed in various organs mouse model. Human anti-PD-1 therapy was treated for assessing drug efficacy in patient-derived tumor. RESULTS: hCD3+hCD45+ T-cells and antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and MDSC) increased in the serum of Hu-PBL-NSG mouse 24 h after the transfusion of human PBMCs, and CD3 + T cells were observed in lung, liver, kidney, spleen sections. Cytokine arrays of human and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse revealed high similarity of Th1, Th2, Th17-related cytokines. A tumor xenograft was engrafted from an EML4-ALK patient, and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse was sacrificed for histological analyses. hCD3+ T cells were infiltrated within the tumor, and CD11c + cells, which represent antigen-presenting capability, were seen in spleen, lung, liver and kidney. When anti-PD-1 Ab was treated intraperitoneally, xenograft tumor showed significant reduction in volume after day 6, and increased expression of immune response-related genes on microarray analysis in the tumor. Mostly IFN-gamma and its related gene sets were significantly changed (FDR < 0.25, GSEA). CONCLUSION: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which highly resembles human immune system was successfully established. This model could be a strong preclinical model for testing efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents, and also for pursuing novel immunotherapy treatment strategies in advanced NSCLC.",PD-L1,3

Herein, we report a case illustrating a durable response to pembrolizumab after a failure with nivolumab. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 76-year-old white male noticed an enlarging papular lesion on his neck. DIAGNOSIS: Malignant melanoma. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent surgery in December 2013 and was found to have a B-Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (BRAF) V600E mutated melanoma. Treatment with BRAF and MAPK/Erk kinase (MEK) inhibitors along with radiation was initiated. After 1 year, the disease progressed, and the treatment was switched to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody, ipilimumab. As the tumor did not respond, the treatment was changed to programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) blockers: nivolumab followed by pembrolizumab. Since the initial diagnosis, the tumor response was monitored by computed tomography (CT) scans. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also used for the assessment of programmed death ligand 1 PD-L1) expression in the neck, lung, and spleen lesions. OUTCOMES: The patient had an initial mixed response to nivolumab, but the disease ultimately progressed as evidenced by new metastases to the spleen, thus the treatment was switched to pembrolizumab. After 46 cycles of treatment, all sites of metastases disappeared, including a substantial shrinkage of the splenic metastasis. To gain understanding about the pharmacological differences between nivolumab and pembrolizumab, the PD-1-ligands interactions and conformational dynamics responsible for the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade were investigated. The higher affinity of pembrolizumab might likely arise from a unique and large patch of interactions engaging the CD loop of PD-1, thus forcing an important motion across the PD-1 immunoreceptor. LESSONS: In this case report, we described the tolerance and response of a melanoma patient to a sequence of various agents, including ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical report highlighting differences between PD-1 blockers, as shown by the unexpected and durable response of the tumor to pembrolizumab, after a treatment failure with nivolumab.",PD-L1,3

Epub 2019 Apr 17.,Clinical Experience of Immunotherapy Treatment: Efficacy and Toxicity Analysis of the Compassionate Use Program of Nivolumab in Patients with Advanced Squamous Cell Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab is an approved therapy option for the treatment of advanced squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer (SQ-NSCLC) patients. Data outside clinical trials about therapy efficacy and safety in later therapy line treatments have rarely been described until now. METHODS: We performed a retrospective data analysis of patients who were enrolled into the nivolu-mab Compassionate Use Program (CUP) in Germany. Sufficient clinical data of 40 patients were available for efficacy and safety analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 47.5% of all treated patients were not affected by any adverse events (AEs); 17.5% of patients suffered from severe AEs. The 1-year survival rate was 61.3%. Estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months. Patients who received nivolumab as third or later therapy line treatment (77.5%) achieved similar median PFS and 12-month overall survival rate of 52%. CONCLUSION: Our findings of immunotherapy treatment outside clinical trials support the results of studies in the past and confirm the efficacy and favorable toxicity profile of nivolumab treatment in advanced SQ-NSCLC patients. In addition, we can present some rarely described information about nivolumab treatment of heavily pretreated patients, which provides some evidence that immunotherapy could also be useful in later therapy lines.© 2019 S.

However, none of these trials included Mexican populations. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis involving 87 patients with advanced cancer who received PD-1 inhibitors as part of their therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of pneumonitis after using PD-1 inhibitors. The secondary outcomes were major risk factors and radiological patterns of pneumonitis. RESULTS: We found 13 cases of pneumonitis, giving an overall incidence of 15%; three of the cases were high-grade (grade 3). A ground-glass pattern was the major form found by chest computed tomography scans. We did not find any significant risk factor for pneumonitis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of pneumonitis secondary to treatment with PD-1 inhibitors in our Mexican population was 15%, which is 5 times higher than that found in other studies. No risk factor was identified for this increased incidence of drug-induced pneumonitis following the use of PD-1 inhibitors.© 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",PD-L1,3

In advanced non-small cell lung cancers, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) have become second-line therapy and have revolutionized the management in selective cases conferring better overall response rates and progression free survival. Methods: We present a case series and review of literature emphasizing this immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer who were treated with Nivolumab as a second line therapeutic option. Results: PD-1 inhibitors such as, Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab, have shown a stable regression of various malignancies, such as metastatic melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. We describe 2 cases of such immune related adverse effects associated with immune check point inhibitors with recovery in one of the patients. Steroid therapy has been the cornerstone for treatment for such immune related adverse effects. Importance has also been laid on the typical radiographic patterns of pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease associated with immunotherapy. Conclusions: We attempt to raise awareness, discuss early management strategies and hypothesize an association between the incidence and development of these adverse events in cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapeutic agents.",PD-L1,3

Innate immunity activates the adaptive immunity, and both act highly regulated together  to establish and maintain tissue homeostasis. Any dysregulation of this interaction can result in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity and is thought to be a major underlying cause in the initiation and progression of highly prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases among others, and periodontitis. Th1 and Th2 cells of the adaptive immune system are the major players in the pathogenesis of IMIDs. In addition, Th17 cells, their key cytokine IL-17, and IL-23 seem to play pivotal roles. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge about the differentiation of Th17 cells and the role of the IL-17/IL-23 axis in the pathogenesis of IMIDs.

Recently, a new CARD14 -associated phenotype defined as CAPE (CARD14-associated papulosquamous eruption) with clinical features of both psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris was reported. We describe a family carrying a novel heterozygous mutation in CARD14 gene, with childhood-onset erythrodermic psoriasis requiring an unusual extremely high dose (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab to achieve disease remission. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a large family with three pairs of twins presenting a clinical phenotype characterized by childhood-onset erythrodermic psoriasis; in some family members is also reported psoriatic arthritis. The two probands presented poor clinical response to topic and systemic therapy with antihistamine, steroid, retinoids, cyclosporine and etanercept. After exclusion of the most common genes associated to autoinflammatory diseases (IL36RN, IL1RN,  MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NLRP12, MEFV, NOD2, PSMB8, PSTPIP1, LPIN2) we approached a  new gene search by subjecting to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis five members of the family. A novel heterozygous mutation (c.446 T > G, leading to the missense amino acid substitution p.L149R) in the exon 4 of the CARD14 gene was identified in all affected members. Increasing dosages (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), allowed the complete control of the clinical  manifestations, with an evident reduction of circulating Th17 and Th22 CD4+ T cell subsets. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the association of mutations of the CARD14 gene with an  erythrodermic psoriasis pedigree, underlying the necessity to investigate CARD14  mutations in childhood-onset psoriasis cases and confirming the presence of CARD14 causative mutations also in erythrodermic psoriasis form, as recently reported. Also in pediatric age, ustekinumab represents a powerful therapeutic option for this rare condition, that is usually refractory to other treatments. In young children, high and frequent dosages allowed a complete control of the clinical manifestations without any severe side effects, with a long-term follow-up.",Th17,4

These fuel a self-amplifying loop where these products  act on T cells to perpetuate cutaneous inflammatory processes. Among the various  inflammatory mediators involved, interleukin (IL)-36 cytokines are important for  the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and Th17 cells in psoriatic skin. In particular, IL-36s induce chemokines and cytokines interfere with differentiation/cornification programs in the epidermis, as well as promote pathological angiogenesis and endothelial cell activation. IL-36 cytokines belong to the IL-1 family, and comprise IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ agonists as well as IL-36 receptor antagonist and IL-38 antagonists. IL-36 cytokines are up-regulated in psoriatic epidermis, and their expression is strongly induced by TNF-α and IL-17. Contrarily, IL-38 antagonist is downregulated, and its impaired expression may be relevant to the dysregulated inflammatory processes induced by IL-36. Here, we discuss on the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the altered balance of IL-36 agonists/antagonists and the significance of this dysregulation in psoriasis. Collection of the information will provide a theoretical basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on IL-36 agonist/antagonist manipulation in psoriasis.",Th17,4

[Epub ahead of print],Physiological and pathological roles of kallikrein-related peptidases in the epidermis.,"Identifying the function of kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) in the epidermis has elicited great interest over recent decades. KLKs comprise 15 serine proteases, and their activities are regulated by complex and fine-tuned mechanisms involving the proteolytic activation cascade, endogenous inhibitors, and environmental factors. When the balance is disrupted, excessive or insufficient protease activity can impair epidermal barrier homeostasis. KLKs are involved in various events, such as skin inflammation, wound healing, pruritus, anti-bacterial activity, and viral susceptibility. One of the primary roles of KLKs, mainly KLK5 and KLK7, is physiological desquamation. Both proteases are also involved in the development of inflammatory skin diseases with barrier abnormalities, e.g., Netherton syndrome and atopic dermatitis (AD). In Netherton  syndrome, unrestricted activity of KLK5 due to loss of the major endogenous inhibitor, lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI), destroys the component molecules of corneodesmosome, leading to Th2 and Th17 inflammation. Meanwhile, the increased activity of KLK7 in the hyperkeratotic lesions of chronic AD is suppressed by upregulated LEKTI. The functions and implications of  other KLKs including KLK6 and KLK8 in healthy and diseased skin such as psoriasis represent an exciting but relatively unexplored area. Clarifying the function of  epidermal KLKs will enable development of disease-specific biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies.",Th17,4

It is associated with a number of comorbidities, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and myocardial infarction. In addition, the severity of psoriasis seems to be related to the severity of obesity. Patients with higher levels of obesity show poorer response to systemic treatments of psoriasis. Several studies have demonstrated that white adipose tissue is a crucial site of  the formation of proinflammatory adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin and classical cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-) 6 and tumour necrosis factor-α. In psoriasis, due to the proliferation of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells, IL-22, among others, is produced in addition to the abovementioned cytokines. With respect to leptin and resistin, both of these adipokines are present in high levels in obese persons with psoriasis. Further, the plasma levels of leptin and  resistin are related to the severity of psoriasis. These results strongly suggest that obesity, through proinflammatory pathways, is a predisposing factor to the development of psoriasis and that obesity aggravates existing psoriasis. Different inflammatory biomarkers link psoriasis and obesity. In this paper, the  most important ones are described.",Th17,4

In spite of the importance of TSP-1 not only as anti-angiogenic factor but also as an immunomodulatory molecule, studies on the role of TSP-1 in psoriasis have been neglected. TSP-1 and CD47 expression were analyzed in skin samples from psoriasis patients and control subjects using RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Expression of these molecules was also evaluated in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells, moDCs, and circulating primary DCs. The functional role of TSP-1/CD47 signaling axis in psoriasis was assessed in Th17 and Treg differentiation assays. Additionally, small interfering RNA assays specific to TSP-1 were performed in CD4+ T cells and monocyte derived DC to specifically evaluate the function of this protein. Lesional skin of psoriasis patients expressed lower TSP-1 and CD47 mRNA levels compared to non-lesional skin or skin from controls. Immunofluorescence staining revealed decreased expression  of CD47 in CD45+ dermal cells from psoriasis samples compared to control subjects. Peripheral CD4+ T cells and circulating primary DCs from psoriasis also expressed lower levels of CD47 compared to controls. Although no significant differences were detected in TSP-1 expression in CD4+ T cells and moDCs between patients and controls, TSP-1 expression in psoriasis patients inversely correlated with disease activity evaluated by the Psoriasis Area and Index Activity. Furthermore, exogenous TSP-1 inhibited Th17 differentiation and stimulated the differentiation of CD4+ T cells toward Treg cells. Furthermore, RNA interference specific for TSP-1 confirmed the role of this molecule as a negative regulator of T cell activation. Because of the impact of TSP-1/CD47 signaling axis in Th17 and Treg differentiation, a dysregulated expression of these molecules in the immune cells from psoriasis patients may favor the exacerbated inflammatory response in this disease.",Th17,4

[Epub ahead of print],Long-term Western diet intake leads to dysregulated bile acid signaling and dermatitis with Th2 and Th17 pathway features in mice.,"BACKGROUND: Dietary interventions are implicated in the development of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and acne. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of diet and the bile acid (BA) receptors, such as TGR5 (Takeda G protein receptor 5) and S1PR2 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2) in the development of dermatitis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (CD) or Western diet (WD) since weaning until they were 10 months old followed by analyzing histology, gene expression, and BA profiling. RESULTS: Mice developed dermatitis as they aged and the incidence was higher in females than males. Additionally, WD intake substantially increased the incidence of dermatitis. Cutaneous antimicrobial peptide genesS100A8, S100A9, and Defb4 were reduced in WD-fed mice, but increased when mice developed skin lesions. In addition, Tgr5 and TGR5-regulated Dio2 and Nos3 were reduced in WD intake but induced in dermatitic lesions. Trpa1 and Trpv1, which mediate itch, were also increased in dermatitic lesions. The expression of S1pr2 and genes encoding sphingosine kinases, S1P phosphatases, binding protein, and transporter were all  reduced by WD intake but elevated in dermatitic lesions. Furthermore, dermatitis  development increased total cutaneous BA with an altered profile, which may change TGR5 and S1PR2 activity. Moreover, supplementation with BA sequestrant cholestyramine reduced epidermal thickening as well as cutaneous inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: In summary, activation of TGR5 and S1PR2, which regulate itch, keratinocyte proliferation, metabolism, and inflammation, may contribute to WD-exacerbated dermatitis with Th2 and Th17 features. In addition, elevated total BA play a significant role in inducing dermatitis and cutaneous inflammation.",Th17,4

[Epub ahead of print],Apremilast increases IL-10-producing regulatory B cells and decreases proinflammatory T cells and innate cells in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.,"OBJECTIVES: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis are immune-mediated inflammatory diseases sharing common immunological mechanisms. Regulatory B cells (Breg cells) producing IL-10 (B10 cells), a critical anti-inflammatory B-cell subset, were found to be decreased in both PsA and psoriasis. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4(PDE4) inhibitor, increases IL-10 and therefore, we examined the effect of apremilast on Breg cells. METHODS: Fifty patients, including 20 with PsA and 30 with psoriasis, were included in the study. The effect of apremilast on Breg cells at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment, was examined by flow cytometry in ODN2006 (TLR9)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and magnetically-isolated cells. Th1 cells, Th17 cells and NKT were also measured. RESULTS: Ex vivo stimulated cell analysis identified that post-apremilast (IL-10+CD19+) B10 cells were increased in all PsA and psoriasis patients and correlated with psoriatic skin and joint clinical improvement. Apremilast decreased IFNγ(+) T and NKT cells and IL-17(+)NKT cells. B10 cells also inversely correlated with Th1 cells, and IFNγ(+)NKT cells. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Breg cells are a major target of apremilast in PsA and psoriasis and that apremilast-induced increase of Breg cells is associated with a decrease of Th1 cells, IFNγ-producing NKT cells and IL-17-producing NKT cells.",Th17,4

[Epub ahead of print],Guselkumab efficacy after withdrawal is associated with suppression of serum IL-23-regulated IL-17 and IL-22 in psoriasis: VOYAGE 2 study.,"BACKGROUND: Guselkumab selectively inhibits interleukin (IL)-23 and in psoriasis, produces high clinical responses including durable maintenance following treatment withdrawal in some patients. The relationships between IL-23 blockade,  serum markers downstream of IL-23 signaling, and withdrawal were explored with guselkumab in VOYAGE 2. METHODS: At week 28, patients with ≥90% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index improvement from baseline (PASI 90) were re-randomized to withdrawal and received placebo (n=182), or maintenance therapy (n=193). The guselkumab withdrawal group  reinitiated guselkumab upon loss of ≥50% of week 28 PASI improvement or by week 72. Cytokines changes associated with psoriasis recurrence (serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and IL-23) following withdrawal were evaluated. RESULTS: Efficacy in the guselkumab maintenance group was sustained through week  72, while efficacy diminished in the guselkumab withdrawal group (PASI 90: 86.0%  vs. 11.5%). After 20 weeks of retreatment, 80.4% of guselkumab withdrawal patients achieved PASI 90 responses versus baseline. Maintenance of response following withdrawal was associated with suppression of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22. Increases in cytokine levels had poor predictive power for psoriasis reoccurrence as these increases lagged behind increases in PASI scores CONCLUSION: Upon guselkumab withdrawal, most patients lost clinical response and regained responses with retreatment. Correlation of IL-23 signaling serum cytokines increased with disease recurrence, supporting the role of IL-23 in expansion and  maintenance of CD4+ Th17, Th22, and related CD8+ Tc cell subsets producing IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22.",Th17,4

IL-17A has been shown to signal through IL-17 receptor A/IL-17 receptor C (IL-17RA/IL-17RC) complex to  drive inflammatory responses. However, in a psoriasis model, we found that Il17rc deficiency did not completely ameliorate the disease, suggesting another receptor. In search for another IL-17A-interacting receptor, we found that IL-17RD directly bound IL-17A but not IL-17F or IL-17A/F heterodimer and formed a heterodimer with IL-17RA. IL-17A-, but not IL-17F- or IL-17A/F-, mediated gene expression was defective in Il17rd-deficient keratinocytes. Il17rd deficiency in  nonhemopoietic cells attenuated imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Although IL-17RC and IL-17RD differentially activated IL-17A-dependent signaling and gene expression, their compound mutation led to complete deficits in keratinocytes. IL-23 was found induced by IL-17A in keratinocytes, dependent on both IL-17RC and IL-17RD, suggesting feed-forward regulation of IL-23/IL-17 axis in psoriasis. Together, IL-17RD constitutes a second functional receptor for IL-17A and, together with IL-17RC, mediates the proinflammatory gene expression downstream of IL-17A.",Th17,4

Interferon signaling and the nuclear factor-κB cascade are involved in PsA, and there are genetic differences between purely cutaneous psoriasis (PsC) and PsA. Psoriasis susceptibility genes for which putative functional coding variants in TYK2 and TRAF3IP2 are strongly associated with PsC and PsA, and neutrophil extracellular traps promote Th17 induction in an Act1 D10N-dependent fashion. Genomics and serological factors may also predict treatment response in tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in PsA, and genetics may play a role in treatment response to TNFi. Collaborations through the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) are essential to increase study population size, which will enhance the  ability to detect the genetic variants that create a predisposition to psoriatic  disease and to predict response to biological therapy.",Th17,4

Epub 2019 May 21.,Current understanding of the role of dietary lipids in the pathophysiology of psoriasis.,"Dietary lipids are fundamental nutrients for human health. They are typically composed of various long-chain fatty acids which include saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). UFAs are further classified into several groups, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and omega-6 PUFAs, depending on their chemical structure. Epidemiological studies have suggested the involvement of dietary lipids in the progression or regulation of psoriasis, a common chronic inflammatory skin disease induced via the IL-23/IL-17 axis. Although the underlying mechanisms by which dietary lipids regulate psoriasis have remained unclear, with the advancement of experimental techniques  and the development of psoriasis mouse models, various possible mechanisms have been proposed. For example, SFAs may facilitate psoriatic dermatitis by causing activation of the inflammasome in keratinocytes and macrophages or by inducing IL-17-producing cells, such as Th17 and IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the skin, while omega-3 PUFAs may play inhibitory roles by suppressing Th17 differentiation. In this review, we summarize current data on the roles of dietary lipids in the development of psoriasis as revealed by mouse studies, and  we discuss potential therapeutic strategies for psoriasis from the perspective of dietary lipids.",Th17,4

Current treatment for psoriasis  relies on conventional immunosuppressive agents. However, long-term treatment with global immunosuppression may cause various side effects. Thus, it is compelling to seek alternative drugs for treating psoriasis with potentially less side effects. Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene, an ingredient that originally exists in natural plants and lacks systemic toxicity. BA can regulate immunity with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it's unknown whether BA has a therapeutic effect on psoriasis. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether BA  attenuates psoriatic skin inflammation and to identify its mechanisms of action.  A murine model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis was utilized to evaluate skin lesion while flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed for immunoassays. We found that BA treatment alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammatory skin lesion. BA lowered  the PASI scores, decreased epidermal thickness and reduced T cell infiltration in the skin lesion. Moreover, BA reduced the frequency of IL-17A-expressing CD4+ and γδ T cells in psoriatic mice, but did not alter CD4+FoxP3+ Treg frequency. BA also reduced IL-17A production but increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in serum of the psoriatic mice. Furthermore, BA inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in skin lesions, including RORγt, IL-17A, IL-6 and  TNFα. Importantly, it suppressed NFκB signaling in the skin lesion. Finally, BA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-17A production by CD4+ T-Cells in vitro. Thus, BA attenuates psoriasis and inhibits Th17 development.",Th17,4

The function of TRPA1, however, in psoriasiform dermatitis (PsD) is uncertain. Herein, we found that expression of TRPA1 is highly up-regulated in human psoriatic lesional skin. To study the role  of TRPA1 in PsD, we assessed Psoriasis Severity Index (PSI) scores, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin thickness and pathology, and examined dermal inflammatory infiltrates, Th17-related genes and itch-related genes in c57BL/6 as wild-type (WT) and TRPA1 gene knockout (KO) mice following daily application of topical IMQ cream for 5 days. Compared with WT mice, clinical scores, skin thickness change and TEWL scores were similar on day 3, but were significantly decreased on day 5 in IMQ-treated TRPA1 KO mice (vs WT mice), suggesting reduced inflammation and skin barrier defects. Additionally, the relative area of epidermal Munro's microabscesses and mRNA levels of neutrophil inducible chemokines (S100A8, S100A9 and CXCL1) were decreased in the treated skin of TRPA1 KO mice, suggesting that neutrophil recruitment was impaired in the KO mice. Furthermore, mast cells, CD31+ blood vascular cells, CD45+ leukocytes and CD3+ T cells were all reduced in the treated skin of TRPA1 KO mice. Lastly, mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were decreased in TRPA1 KO mice. In summary, these results suggest a key role for TRPA1 in psoriasiform inflammation and raising its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.",Th17,4

The aim of this study was to evaluate the adaptive immune profile of patients with severe psoriasis under immunobiological treatment in two time points. Thirty-two psoriasis patients and  10 control patients were evaluated. In the group of psoriasis patients, 10 patients were on anti-TNF and 14 patients on methotrexate treatment, while 8 individuals were not treated. IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-2, and IL-10 were analyzed. CD4 T cell intracellular cytokines were analyzed. It was observed that  stimulation could significantly increase the production of IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 only before anti-TNF pulse therapy. The activation of Th1 and Treg cells after stimulation was significantly higher before anti-TNF pulse. Patients  on methotrexate or anti-TNF therapy produced significantly lower levels of TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-6. Furthermore, these patients showed a significant decrease in the activated CD4+ T cells.

Psoriasis is one of the most common immune-mediated chronic skin diseases, strongly associated with IL-17A. Clinically, the monoclonal antibodies to IL-17A or its receptor, IL-17R, show a dramatic effect against psoriasis. Alopecia is also an IL-17-mediated autoimmune  disease, and IL-17 inhibitors have been expected to be the gold standard for the  treatment of alopecia; therefore, the complication of alopecia while using IL-17  may be regarded as an unexpected paradoxical reaction. T helper (Th)17 cells are not cytotoxic enough by themselves to undermine the hair follicle under normal circumstances, they need the coexistence of CD8+ cytotoxic Th1 cells. Th17 cells may be the initiator of the damage of the hair follicle, but CD8 T cells or more powerful Th1 cells are required as followers. The Th17/Th1 axis might convert into a Th1-dominant immune status using IL-17 inhibitors, and the destruction of the hair follicle might result in alopecia.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study recruited 70 patients with psoriasis and 76 healthy controls. Cytokine profiles were evaluated, including pro-inflammatory M1 (IL-1 + IL-6 + TNF-α), Th1 (IL-2 + IL-12 + IFN-γ), Th17 (IL-6 + IL-17), and immune-inflammatory response system (IRS = M1 + Th1 + Th17) profiles. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory potential included Th2 (IL-4), Th2 + T regulatory (Th2 + Treg, namely IL-4 + IL-10 + TGF-β), anti-inflammatory (Th2 + Treg + adiponectin), and the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory index. RESULTS: There was a highly significant association between psoriasis and cytokine levels with an effect size of 0.829 and a particularly strong impact on  IL-2 (0.463), IL-12 (0.451), IL-10 (0.532) and adiponectin (0.401). TGF-β and adiponectin were significantly lower while all other cytokines (except IFN-γ) were significantly higher in psoriasis than in controls. In addition, M1, Th1, Th17, Th2 + Treg, and IRS/Anti-inflammatory index were significantly higher in psoriasis patients than in controls. The IRS index, Th2 + Treg, and adiponectin predicted psoriasis with 97.1% sensitivity and 94% specificity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, psoriasis is characterized by increased M1, Th1, Th2 and Th17 profiles together with lowered TGF-β and adiponectin. In addition, we propose a model based on a higher IRS and Th2 + Treg index coupled with lower adiponectin values, which may be used to externally validate the diagnosis of psoriasis. The most important single biomarker of psoriasis is adiponectin. Because the latter may play a role in the modulation of the chronic inflammatory  response in psoriasis, adiponectin could be a new drug target to treat psoriasis.",Th17,4

However, variable relationships amongst the expression of psoriasis susceptibility genes and of IL17A, IL22, and IL23A were identified. Additionally, to shed light on gene expression relationships in psoriasis, we applied a machine learning nonlinear dimensionality reduction strategy (t-SNE) to display the entire psoriasis transcriptome as a 2-dimensonal image. This analysis revealed a variety of gene clusters, relevant to psoriasis pathophysiology but failed to support a relationship between IL17A and IL22.

The immunocompetent lesional skin model displayed a delayed onset of epidermal differentiation, an hyperproliferation of  the basal keratinocytes, a drastic increase in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and a disturbed expression of key transcription factors, as observed in lesional plaques, suggesting a crucial importance of combining the pathological phenotype of cutaneous cells to T cells in order to generate a relevant model for psoriasis.

Helper T cells (TH), plasmoid, and dermal dendritic cells play a prominent role in the development of  classical psoriatic lesions. Interleukin stimulation is another important process in the pathogenesis of the disease that directly influences keratinocytes and leading to the formation of psoriatic pattern in the skin. Tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) α which releases from keratinocytes activates dendritic cells in the early  stages of complex pathogenesis of psoriasis. Activated keratinocytes also produce other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b and IL-6), antimicrobial peptides, and various chemokines. TNF activates dendritic cells that produce IL-23, leading to  TH17 differentiation. TH17 cells secrete IL-17A, which has been shown to promote  psoriatic skin changes.

Dysregulated Th17 immune responses have been associated with the pathogenesis of  several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. In this article, we describe the in vitro  pharmacology of a potent and selective low molecular weight RORγt inhibitor identified after a structure-based hit-to-lead optimization effort. The compound  interfered with co-activator binding to the RORγt ligand binding domain and impaired the transcriptional activity of RORγt as evidenced by blocked IL-17A secretion and RORE-mediated transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene. The inhibitor effectively reduced IL-17A production by human naive and memory T-cells and attenuated transcription of pro-inflammatory Th17 signature genes, such as IL17F, IL22, IL26, IL23R, and CCR6. The compound selectively suppressed the Th17/IL-17 pathway and did not interfere with polarization of other T helper cell lineages. Furthermore, the inhibitor was selective for RORγt and did not modify the transcriptional activity of the closely related family members RORα and RORβ. Using human keratinocytes cultured with supernatants from compound treated Th17 cells we showed that pharmacological inhibition of RORγt translated to suppressed IL-17-regulated gene expression in keratinocyte cell cultures. Furthermore, in ex vivo immersion skin cultures our RORγt inhibitor suppressed IL-17A production by  Th17-skewed skin resident cells which correlated with reduced human β defensin 2  expression in the skin. Our data suggests that inhibiting RORγt transcriptional activity by a low molecular weight inhibitor may hold utility for the treatment of Th17/IL-17-mediated skin pathologies.",Th17,4

Moreover, several genome wide association studies (GWAS) pinpointing a key genetic association between the HLA-DR locus and RA have led to the generally agreed hypothesis that CD4+ T cells are directly implicated in the disease. Still, RA is a heterogeneous disease and  much effort has been made to understand its different facets. T cell differentiation is driven by mechanisms including antigen stimulation, co-stimulatory signals and cytokine milieu, all of which are abundant in the rheumatic joint, implying that any T cells migrating into the joint may be further affected locally. In parallel to the characterization and classification  of T-cell subsets, the contribution of different effector T cells to RA has been  investigated in numerous studies though sometimes with contradictory results. In  particular, the frequency of Th1 and Th17 cells has been assessed in the synovial joints with various results that could, at least partly, be explained by the stage of the disease. For regulatory T cells, it is largely accepted that they accumulate in RA synovial fluid and that the equilibrium between regulatory T cells and effector cells is a key factor in controlling inflammation processes involved in RA. Recent phenotypic studies describe the possible implication of a  novel subset of peripheral T helper cells (Tph) important for T-B cell cross talk and plasma cell differentiation in the RA joint of ACPA+ (autoantibodies against  citrullinated proteins) RA patients. Finally, cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, historically described as increased in the peripheral blood of RA patients have attracted new attention in the last years. In view of the recently identified peripheral T-cell subsets, we will integrate immunological data as well as information on genetic variants and therapeutic strategy outcomes into our current understanding of the width of effector T cells.

On the other hand, RORγt is also critical for controlling apoptosis during thymopoiesis, and genetic RORγt ablation or systematic RORγt inhibition cause progressive thymic aberrations leading to T cell lymphomas. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether topical administration of our novel RORγt inhibitor, S18-000003 has therapeutic potential for psoriasis with low risk of thymic aberrations. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of topical S18-000003 on psoriasis-like skin inflammation and influence on the thymus in a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced K14.Stat3C mouse psoriasis model. RESULTS: S18-000003 markedly inhibited the development of psoriatic skin inflammation via suppression of the IL-17 pathway. In the skin, S18-000003 suppressed all subsets of IL-17-producing cells that we previously identified in  this psoriasis model: Th17 cells, Tc17 cells, dermal γδ T cells, TCR- cells that  probably included innate lymphoid cells, and CD4-CD8- double-negative αβ T cells. Notably, neither reduction of CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes nor dysregulation of cell cycling was observed in S18-000003-treated mice, even at a  high dose.

Aggravating factors have been identified that initiate and maintain inflammation, including expression of Th1-, Th17-, and Th22-cell derived cytokines. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily ancient and highly conserved damage-associated molecular  pattern molecule high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is significantly increased in the serum of PV patients with disease progression and is decreased under standard therapies. Materials and methods: To better understand the role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of PV, we recruited 22 untreated psoriatic patients with either mild or severe disease, defined by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index. We assessed HMGB1 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression in the skin by immunohistochemistry and analyzed the immune-phenotype of Treg and Th17 cells by  flow cytometry. Results: We found increased staining for HMGB1 in the dermis of psoriatic plaques in comparison to uninvolved skin of patients with PV. In addition, the major histocompatibility complex class III-encoded DNA and HMGB1 RAGE, induced by HMGB1, were highly expressed on psoriatic CD8+ T cells and CD4+ Treg. High expression of HMGB1 in the lesional skin was associated with even higher expression of its receptor, RAGE, on the cell surface of keratino-cytes in patients with severe PV. Conclusion: The presence of HMGB1 and RAGE signaling may impact orchestration of  chronic inflammation in PV which might have implications for Treg and Th17 cells.",Th17,4

In this study, it was prepared from the aerial parts of Strobilanthes cusia. Three undescribed indole alkaloid derivatives, indigodoles A-C, along with seven known  compounds were isolated from this preparation of Qing Dai and their structures were elucidated from spectroscopic data, including NMR, MS, UV, IR, optical rotation, and CD. As well, most compounds were tested against IL-17. Indigodole C and tryptanthrin could significantly inhibit IL-17 production of Th17 cells. In addition, indigodole A and indirubin showed notably anti-IL-17 gene expression in dose-dependent effects without cytotoxicities toward Th17 and Jurkat cells, respectively. Overall, our studies indicate that the aforementioned indole alkaloids could contribute to anti-IL 17 properties of Qing Dai.",Th17,4

CHF6001 is a novel, potent and selective inhaled PDE4 inhibitor in development for the treatment of COPD. When tested in vitro on human dendritic cells (DCs), CHF6001 decreased the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), chemokines (CXCL8, CCL3, CXCL10 and CCL19) and of Th1- and Th17-polarizing cytokines (IL-12, IL-23 and IL-1β). In contrast to β-methasone, a reference steroid anti-inflammatory drug, CHF6001 increased the secretion of CCL22, a Th2 recruiting chemokine, and the expression of the lymph node homing receptor CCR7. Accordingly, the migration of DCs to CCR7 ligands was increased, while migration to pro-inflammatory chemokines was decreased. Of note, the action of CHF6001 was apparently mediated by a promoter-specific decrease in NF-κB p65 recruitment, independent of perturbation of LPS signalling or NF-κB nuclear translocation. Our results indicate that CHF6001 can modulate DC pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 polarizing potential by fine tuning the transcriptional activity of the  master inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. Therefore, CHF6001 may prove useful to control Th1/Th17-polarized inflammatory diseases such as COPD.",Th17,4

It is not clear, however, whether this is a cause or consequence of the disease. In this study, using an experimental mouse model of psoriasis induced by imiquimod (IMQ), we show that oral treatment with a broad spectrum of antibiotics (MIX) or metronidazole (MET) alone mitigates the severity of skin inflammation through downregulation of Th17 immune response in conventional mice. Since some antibiotics, including MET, can influence immune system reactivity, we also evaluated the effect of MIX in the same model under germ-free (GF) conditions. GF mice treated with MET did not show milder signs of imiquimod-induced skin inflammation (IISI) which supports the conclusion that the therapeutic effect is  mediated by changes in microbiota composition. Moreover, compared to controls, mice treated with MIX had a significantly higher abundance of the genus Lactobacillus in the intestine and on the skin. Mice treated with MET had a significantly higher abundance of the genera Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus both on the skin and in the intestine and of Parabacteroides distasonis in the intestine. Additionally, GF mice and mice monocolonized with either Lactobacillus plantarum or segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) were more resistant to IISI than conventional mice. Interestingly, compared to GF mice, IMQ induced a higher  degree of systemic Th17 activation in mice monocolonized with SFB but not with L. plantarum. The present findings provide evidence that intestinal and skin microbiota directly regulates IISI and emphasizes the importance of microbiota in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.",Th17,4

Complex interplay between inflammatory cytokines and T-cells, especially Th1 and Th17 cells, leads to abnormal cell proliferation and psoriatic skin lesions. Nevertheless, such mechanisms do not entirely represent the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Moreover, earlier and better biomarkers in diagnostics, prognostics, and monitoring therapeutic outcomes of psoriasis are still needed. During the last two decades, proteomics (a systematic analysis of proteins for their identities, quantities, and functions) has been widely employed to psoriatic research. This review summarizes and discusses all of the previous studies that applied various modalities of proteomics technologies to psoriatic skin disease.  The data obtained from such studies have led to (i) novel mechanisms and new hypotheses of the disease pathogenesis; (ii) biomarker discovery for diagnostics  and prognostics; and (iii) proteome profiling for monitoring treatment efficacy and drug-induced toxicities.",Th17,4

Circulating S1P levels have been reported to be increased in patients with psoriasis relative to healthy patients. The aim of this study was to examine the  potency of S1P inhibition using an imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse model. Both  topical ceramidase and sphingosine kinase 1/2 inhibition, which blocks S1P generation, alleviated imiquimod-induced skin lesions and reduced the serum interleukin 17-A levels induced by application of imiquimod. These treatments also normalized skin mRNA levels of genes associated with inflammation and keratinocyte differentiation. Inhibition of sphingosine kinase 2, but not sphingosine kinase 1, diminished levels of suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 and blocked T helper type 17 differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells; imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin symptoms were also ameliorated. These results indicate the distinct effects of sphingosine kinase 1 and sphingosine kinase 2 inhibition on T helper type 17 generation and suggest molecules that inhibit S1P formation, including ceramidase and sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitors,  as novel therapeutic candidates for psoriasis.",Th17,4

Recently, several studies have suggested the use of human embryonic stem cell-derived MSCs (hE-MSCs) as an alternative for regenerative cellular therapy due to mass production of MSCs from a single donor. Methods: We generated hE-MSCs from embryonic stem cell lines, SNUhES3, and analyzed immune properties of these cells. Also, we evaluated the in-vivo therapeutic potential of hE-MSCs in immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. Results: The cell showed the suppression of immunity associated with allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells in mixed lymphocyte response assay. We also detected that cytokines and growth factor related to the immune response were secreted from these cells. To assessed the in-vivo therapeutic potential of hE-MSCs in immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, we used imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin psoriasis mouse model. The score of clinical skin was significantly reduced in the hE-MSCs treated group compared with control IMQ group. In histological analysis, the IMQ-induced epidermal thickness was significantly decreased by hE-MSCs treatment. It was correlated with splenomegaly induced by IMQ which was also improved in the hE-MSCs. Moreover, IMQ-induced inflammatory cytokines; Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ,and IL-27) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23), in the serum and skin showed marked inhibition by hE-MSCs. Conclusion: These results suggested that hE-MSCs have a potency of immune modulation in psoriasis, which might be the key factor for the improved psoriasis.",Th17,4

It has been suggested that distinct affected tissues could exhibit different immune-inflammatory pathways so complicating the  understanding of the physiopathology of psoriatic disease as well as its treatment. Despite of the key pathogenic and clinical relevance that enthesitis has in PsA, peripheral arthritis is more easily perceived. At the macroscopic level, PsA synovitis has predominantly tortuous, bushy vessels, whereas rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by mainly straight, branching vessels  so reflecting prominent neo-angiogenesis in PsA. Synovial biopsies have demonstrated a similar cellular and molecular picture in PsA and RA, although some differences have been reported at the group level, as higher density of vessels, CD163+ macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells in PsA. In fact, synovial IL-17+ mast cells are significantly increased in PsA and produce more IL-17A compared with RA, and a proof of concept study supports its relevant role in the  synovitis of SpA, included PsA. As firstly reported in RA, synovial lymphoid neogenesis is found also in the same proportion of PsA as in RA patients, despite the lack of autoantibodies in PsA. These lymphoid structures are associated with  activation of the IL-23/Th17 pathway in RA and seemly in PsA, which could be useful to stratify RA patients. Immunohistochemical and transcriptomic methodologies have still not found synovial biomarkers useful to distinguish psoriatic from rheumatoid synovitis at the patient level. However, modern methodologies, as MALDI-Mass Spectrometry Imaging, applied to the study of synovial tissue have revealed metabolic and lipid signatures which could support  clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of PsA and RA and to go further toward  the personalized medicine.",Th17,4

Epub 2019 Feb 8.,"Emerging role of immune cell network in autoimmune skin disorders: An update on pemphigus, vitiligo and psoriasis.","Autoimmune skin diseases are a group of disorders that arise due to a deregulated immune system resulting in skin tissue destruction. In the majority of these conditions, either autoreactive immune cells or the autoantibodies are generated  against self-antigens of the skin. Although the etiology of these diseases remains elusive, biochemical, genetic, and environmental factors such as infectious agents, toxins damage the skin tissue leading to self-antigen generation, autoantibody attack and finally results in autoimmunity of skin. Immune dysregulation, which involves predominantly T helper 1/17 (Th1/Th17) polarization and the inability of regulatory T cells to regress immune response,  is implicated in autoimmune skin diseases. The emerging roles of immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines in the pathogenesis of common autoimmune skin diseases  like pemphigus, vitiligo, and psoriasis are discussed in this review. The main focus is on the interplay between immune cell network including the innate and adaptive immune system, regulatory cells, immune checkpoints and recently identified tissue-resident memory cells (TRMs) in disease pathogenesis and relapse. We also attempt to highlight on the immune mechanisms common to these diseases which can be targeted for designing novel therapeutics.",Th17,4

Epub 2019 Feb 14.,Clinical significance and immunobiology of IL-21 in autoimmunity.,"Interleukin-21 (IL-21), an autocrine cytokine predominantly produced by follicular helper T (Tfh) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells, has been proven to play an important role in the immune system, for example, by promoting proliferation and the development of Tfh and Th17 cells, balancing helper T cell subsets, inducing B cell generation and differentiation into plasma cells, and enhancing the production of immunoglobulin. These effects are mainly mediated by activation of the JAK/STAT, MAPK and PI3K pathways. Some IL-21 target genes, such as B lymphocyte induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), CXCR5 and Bcl-6, play important roles in the immune response. Therefore, IL-21 has been linked to autoimmune diseases. Indeed, IL-21 levels are increased in the peripheral blood and tissues of patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and psoriasis. This increased IL-21 even positively associates with Tfh cells, plasma cells, autoantibodies and disease activity in SLE and RA.  Additionally, IL-21 has been utilized as a therapeutic target in SLE, RA, T1D and psoriatic mouse models. Profoundly, clinical trials have shown safety and improvement in RA patients. However, tolerance and long-term pharmacodynamics effects with low bioavailability have been found in SLE patients. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the latest progress on IL-21 function and its signaling  pathway and discuss the role of IL-21 in the pathogenesis of and therapy for autoimmune diseases, with the hope of providing potential therapeutic and diagnostic strategies for clinical use.",Th17,4

Previously, we showed that exopolysaccharides (EPS-Ca) secreted by Cyanobacterium aponinum, a dominating organism in the Blue Lagoon, increased IL-10 secretion by  human dendritic cells (DCs). In addition, co-culturing allogeneic CD4+ T cells with DCs matured in the presence of EPS-Ca increased differentiation of T cells into T regulatory cells at the cost of the disease inducing Th17 cells. In the present study, EPS-Ca increased the proportion of DCs expressing CD141, a surface molecule linked to regulatory DCs, and the CD141+ cells secreted more IL-10 than  the CD141- cells. EPS-Ca decreased T cell secretion of IL-17, IL-13 and IL-10 and the proportion of T cells expressing the activation marker CD69 that has also been linked to lymphocyte retention. In addition, EPS-Ca reduced keratinocyte secretion of CCL20 and CXCL10, chemokines implicated in recruitment of inflammatory cells. EPS-Ca decreased DC expression of Dectin-1/CLEC7A and SYK, keratinocyte expression of CLEC7A, SYK and CAMP (the gene for LL37), and T cell expression of phosphorylated Zap70. These results indicate that EPS-Ca may induce a regulatory phenotype of DCs, T cells that are less active/inflammatory and less prone to being retained in the skin, and keratinocytes that induce less recruitment of inflammatory cells to the skin and that these effects may be mediated by the effects of EPS-Ca on CLEC7A and SYK. Overall the results indicate that EPS-Ca may be involved in the beneficial effects psoriasis patients experience when bathing in the Blue Lagoon.",Th17,4

It has a great impact on quality of life; patients often experience depression, anxiety, stigma as well as suicidal behavior. Even though psoriasis is one of the most studied dermatological conditions, the pathogenesis of the disease is still not completely elucidated. The complex interactions between keratinocytes, dendritic  cells, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils and mast cells are responsible for the histopathological changes seen in psoriasis. The pathogenic model leading to the  formation of psoriatic plaques has however evolved a lot over the years. There is now enough evidence to support the role of interleukin (IL) -23, IL-17, IL-22, T  helper (Th) -17 cells, Th-22 cells, T regulatory cells, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and IL-10 in the pathogenesis of the disease.

A Systematic Review of Available Evidence.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, appearance of Lewy bodies and presence  of neuroinflammation. No treatments currently exist to prevent PD or delay its progression, and dopaminergic substitution treatments just relieve the consequences of dopaminergic neuron loss. Increasing evidence points to peripheral T lymphocytes as key players in PD, and recently there has been growing interest into the specific role of T helper (Th) 17 lymphocytes. Th17 are a proinflammatory CD4+ T cell lineage named after interleukin (IL)-17, the main cytokine produced by these cells. Th17 are involved in immune-related disease such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and drugs targeting Th17/IL-17 are currently approved for clinical use in such disease. In  the present paper, we first summarized current knowledge about contribution of the peripheral immune system in PD, as well as about the physiopharmacology of Th17 and IL-17 together with its therapeutic relevance. Thereafter, we systematically retrieved and evaluated published evidence about Th17 and IL-17 in PD, to help assessing Th17/IL-17-targeting drugs as potentially novel antiparkinson agents. Critical appraisal of the evidence did not allow to reach definite conclusions: both animal as well as clinical studies are limited, just a few provide mechanistic evidence and none of them investigates the eventual relationship between Th17/IL-17 and clinically relevant endpoints such as disease progression, disability scores, intensity of dopaminergic substitution treatment. Careful assessment of Th17 in PD is anyway a priority, as Th17/IL-17-targeting therapeutics might represent a straightforward opportunity for the unmet needs of PD patients.",Th17,4

Lesional skin of AD contains elevated levels of Th2, Th17, Th22 and Th1-citokines. With a growing movement toward use of targeted therapies, parallel to psoriasis, JAK inhibitors are an important focus of therapeutic research for AD. METHODS: We review current evidence on the efficacy and safety of oral and topical JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AD. RESULTS: Several JAK inhibitors are in phase II and III clinical trials as oral therapies for moderate-to-severe AD or as topical treatments for mild-to-moderate AD. Results thus far are encouraging, with the majority of the patients achieving the primary outcome of their trial as well as a favorable safety profile. DISCUSSION: JAK inhibitors will most certainly be the first oral targeted option  when topical therapy fails. With good oral bioavailability and lack of immunogenicity, they address some of the limitations of biologics. Yet to be defined is whether selective JAK 1 inhibitors or nonselective JAK inhibitors will provide the best equilibrium of efficacy versus side effects. Less clear is the position in the therapeutic ladder for topical JAK inhibitors; although, an unmeet need exists in the topical treatment of AD.",Th17,4

The immune dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of PSO. However, the detail of immune regulation in  PSO is still not very clear. Gαq, the alpha subunit of the Gq protein, played important role in the immune regulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether Gαq was involved in the pathogenesis of PSO. We detected the Gαq expression level and analyzed its relationship with test parameters of PSO patients. Furthermore, we used imiquimod to induce PSO mouse model in Gnaq -/- bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice. The inflammatory cytokines and its correlation with Gαq expression were analyzed both in PSO patients and mice. The results showed that the Gαq expression in PSO patients was much lower and negatively correlated with PSO Area and Severity Index (PASI), CRP, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. In PSO mice models, the skin lesion and keratinocyte proliferation were much more serious in Gnaq -/- BM chimeric mice. Also, the proportions of Th17 cells in Gnaq -/- BM chimeric mice were much higher than WT mice. Furthermore, the IL-17A and TNF-α in Gnaq -/- chimeric mice were also higher. Moreover, IL-17A and TNF-α in PSO patients were negatively associated with the Gαq expression. Our results indicated that Gαq was involved in the pathogenesis of PSO, and its regulation on Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine production might contribute to part of the mechanism of immune dysfunction of PSO.",Th17,4

Innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), perform a critical role in the pathophysiology of  psoriasis by presenting inflammatory/costimulatory signals for differentiation of Th17 cells. Recent studies point to the involvement of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) in inflammatory signaling cascade of DCs. However, it is yet to be determined whether SYK inhibition in DCs would lead to diminishment of psoriatic  inflammation. Therefore, our study evaluated the effects of SYK inhibitor, R406 on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation, expression of costimulatory/inflammatory molecules in DCs and their relationship with Th17/Treg cells. Our data show that R406 causes attenuation of IMQ-induced dermal inflammation as shown by reduction in ear/back skin thickness, acanthosis and myeloperoxidase activity. This was concurrent with reduction in inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in CD11c + DCs such as IL-6, IL-23, MHCII, and CD40. This favoured the suppression of Th17 cells and upregulation of Treg cells in R406-treated mice with psoriasis-like inflammation. Direct activation of TLR7 by IMQ in splenocytic cultures led to increased SYK expression in CD11c + DCs and release of IL-23/IL-6. IMQ-induced IL-6/IL-23 levels were significantly diminished by SYK inhibitor, R406 in splenocytic cultures. In essence, our study shows that SYK inhibition supresses psoriasis-like inflammation by modifying DC function in mice. Further, it implies that SYK inhibition could be a prospective therapeutic approach for the treatment of psoriasis-like inflammation.",Th17,4

IL-23p19 inhibition with risankizumab resulted in superior clinical responses in patients  with psoriasis compared with ustekinumab (dual IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor), but comparative molecular effects have not been established. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the similarities and differences in molecular and histopathologic profiles in skin lesions from patients with psoriasis receiving risankizumab versus ustekinumab at an early time point. METHODS: Lesional skin biopsy samples from 81 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis participating in 2 different studies (a phase I risankizumab study and a phase II study of risankizumab vs ustekinumab) were analyzed by using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Risankizumab induced a rapid decrease in levels of proteins and transcriptomic biomarkers associated with the IL-23 pathway, which were maintained through 8 weeks. At week 4, risankizumab decreased histopathologic expression of biomarkers, including K16, Ki67, CD3, lipocalin-2, CD11c, dendritic cell lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein, β-defensin 2, and S100A7; global  histopathologic scoring revealed that 54% and 69% of patients treated with 90 or  180 mg of risankizumab, respectively, were graded as experiencing excellent improvement versus 29% of patients treated with ustekinumab. At week 4, there was a common decrease in expression of 2645 genes expressed in lesional skin between patients receiving risankizumab and ustekinumab and a significant decrease in 2682 genes unique to risankizumab treatment. Risankizumab more strongly downregulated expression of genes associated with keratinocytes, epidermal cells, and monocytes, versus ustekinumab.

RESULTS: Patients with Vitiligo showed the highest CLA+/CLA- TH1/type 1 cytotoxic T-cell polarization, with parallel TH2/TH9/TH17/TH22 level increases to levels often greater than those seen in patients with AA, AD, or psoriasis (P < .05). Total regulatory T-cell counts were lower in patients with vitiligo than in control subjects and patients with AD or psoriasis (P < .001). Vitiligo severity  correlated with levels of multiple cytokines (P < .1), whereas duration was linked with IFN-γ and IL-17 levels (P < .04). Patients and control subjects grouped into separate clusters based on blood biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Vitiligo is characterized by a multicytokine polarization among circulating skin-homing and systemic subsets, which differentiates it from other  inflammatory/autoimmune skin diseases. Future targeted therapies should delineate the relative contribution of each cytokine axis to disease perpetuation.",Th17,4

These T-cells express IL-17A and the lineage-defining transcription factor RORγt. Th17 cells have a pivotal, physiological role in host defense against pathogens. These pro-inflammatory T-cells are also key players in autoimmunity and a pathogenic role has been demonstrated in several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis. Recently, there is evidence that Th17 cells may drive renal inflammation and renal autoimmunity in anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-(ANCA)-vasculitis and  systemic lupus erythematosus. The aim of this review is to discuss the possible involvement of Th17 cells in renal autoimmunity and its value for future therapeutic approaches.",Th17,4

As psoriasis rarely occurs in nonhuman animals, the lack of an ideal animal model reflecting the histopathological and molecular immunological characteristics of psoriasis remains an urgent issue. In the present study, an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis mouse model was constructed under natural immune conditions and verified by evaluations of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and Baker score, H&E staining, immunohistochemical examination of the CD3 and Gr1 levels, measurement of plasmacytoid dendritic cell- (pDC) and Th17-associated cytokine levels, and evaluation of p65 phosphorylation and TLR7 expression. Moreover, rutaecarpine (RUT), the main active ingredient in the traditional Chinese medicine Wu-Zhu-Yu, could improve psoriasis-like dermatitis through effects on pDC- and Th17-associated cytokines through NF-κB and toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling. Taken together, the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis mouse model can be regarded as an ideal model for evaluating psoriasis pathogenesis and antipsoriatic drugs. We provided theoretical and experimental evidence for the clinical application of RUT in psoriasis.",Th17,4

However, the beneficial effects of MDSCs on the experimental mouse model of psoriasis have not been reported. Therefore, we investigated the anti-psoriatic effect of MDSCs on IMQ-induced skin inflammation  in mice and explored the mechanisms involved. Our results showed that administration of MDSCs (1 × 106 or 2 × 106  cells) suppressed the development of IMQ-induced skin inflammation in mice as exemplified by a significant reduction in clinical severity scores and was associated with a reduction of histopathological changes, including inflammatory infiltration, epidermal hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. The immunosuppressive effect of MDSCs (1 × 106 or 2 × 106  cells) corresponded to the production of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23) in the serum and dorsal skin. Administration of MDSCs (1 × 106 or 2 × 106  cells) also inhibited splenomegaly.  Moreover, an increased percentage of CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells  and decreased percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells were found in mice treated with MDSCs. Taken together, these results imply that MDSCs have immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects on disease progression in a murine model of psoriasis and that MDSCs could be used in preventive or therapeutic strategies for the management of autoimmune inflammatory skin disorders, such as psoriasis.",Th17,4

Because we and others have observed increased NETosis in psoriatic  lesions, we hypothesized that NETs contribute to increased T helper type 17 (Th17) cells in psoriasis. After stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with anti-CD3/CD28 beads for 7 days, we found significantly higher percentages of CD3+CD4+IL-17+ (Th17) cells in the presence versus absence of NETs, as assessed by flow cytometry, IL-17 ELISA, and IL17A/F and RORC mRNAs. Memory, but not naïve, T cells were competent and monocytes were required for CD3/CD28-mediated Th17 induction, with or without NETs. Th17 induction was enhanced by the T allele of rs33980500 (T/C), a psoriasis risk-associated variant in the TRAF3IP2 gene encoding the D10N variant of Act1, a key mediator of IL-17 signal transduction. Global transcriptome analysis of CD3/CD28-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RNA sequencing confirmed the stimulatory effects of NETs, demonstrated NET-induced enhancement of cytokine gene expression, and verified that the effect of Act1 D10N was greater in the presence of NETs. Collectively, these results implicate NETs and the Act1 D10N variant in human Th17 induction from peripheral  blood mononuclear cells, with ramifications for immunogenetic studies of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases.",Th17,4

PSORI-CM02 is a representative herbal formula for the treatment for PS in South China. It was confirmed to improve PS without obvious side effects in the clinic. Here we sought to clarify whether and how PSORI-CM02 regulates T cell differentiation and functions in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like BALB/c mouse model. Mice pre-treated 3 days with PSORI-CM02 significantly alleviated skin inflammation, as reduced in PASI score and classic  psoriatic characteristics in pathological sections. CD3 and CD4 positive T cells  were also fewer in the skin lesions of PSORI-CM02 groups, comparing to control group. PSORI-CM02 also decreased pro-inflammatory IFNγ mRNA and IL-17 A mRNA, while increased IL-4 mRNA in mouse skin lesions. In skin draining lymph nodes (DLN), PSORI-CM02 reduced the ratio of γδT cells and inhibited their function of  producing IL-17 A. Nevertheless PSORI-CM02 had no effects on the ratio of total TCRβ+T cells and CD4 + T cells. But it regulated CD4 + T helper cells differentiation, and resulted in the decreasing percentage of IFNγ producing Th1  cells and IL-17 A producing Th17 cells, while increasing the ratio of IL-4 producing Th2 cells in DLN. Further data showed that PSORI-CM02 promote expression of Th2 specific transcript factor GATA3, but had no effects on T-bet and RORγ. Thus, we tentatively interpret that PSORI-CM02 impairs IMQ-induced psoriasis by promoting Th2 cell response targeting of GATA3.",Th17,4

To avoid drug resistance during cancer treatment, many researchers focused on the study of the downstream therapeutic target of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, ERK1/2 became a hot anticancer target. It has been shown that ERK phosphorylation could activate Th17 cells and therefore induce inflammatory diseases. Due to these results, inhibition of ERK, as a potential drug target, could provide a solution for autoimmune diseases, especially T cell mediated diseases. In this study, a small  synthetic molecule JSI287 was found with the function of alleviating IMQ-induced  mice skin lesions through ERK/IL-17 signaling pathway during the screening of small molecule databases targeting ERK. The results showed that JS1287 small molecule alleviated epidermal thickness, epidermis congestion, edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased release of inflammatory cytokines of IL-6, IL-12 and IL-17A, and further regulated the mRNA expression of ATF1 and protein expression of ERK1/2 in IMQ-induced skin lesions.

While most therapeutic approaches have been centered on insulin replacement, newer approaches to target the underlying immune response have become an area of focus. However, the immune landscape in T1D is extremely complex, and the roles played by individual cytokines during disease progression are incompletely understood, making the development of immunotherapies very difficult. In this review, we discuss the complex auxiliary role played by IL-17, both around the islet and in  peripheral tissues such as the gut and kidney, which might influence T1D progression. Through our re-analysis of the key factors involved IL-17 signaling  in recently published single-cell sequencing and sorted-cell bulk sequencing datasets, we find supporting evidence for the general existence of the signaling  apparatus in islet endocrine cells. We also explore the emerging evidence of IL-17 serving as an influential factor in diabetic complications that affect distal tissues. While anti-IL-17 therapies are emerging as an option for psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders, we highlight here a number of questions that would need to be addressed before their potential applicability to treating  T1D can be fully evaluated.",Th17,4

We speculated that an anti-IL-23 receptor mAb might have greater efficacy than an anti-IL-23 mAb in the treatment of local inflamed lesions with high IL-23 levels. We previously generated an anti-human IL-23 receptor mAb, AS2762900-00, which potently blocked IL-23-induced cell proliferation, regardless of the concentration of IL-23. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of AS2762900-00 in the treatment of psoriasis. Compared with untreated control, AS2762900-00 significantly reduced the epidermal thickness of lesions in a clinically relevant psoriatic human skin xenograft model. The expression of inflammatory genes including genes downstream of IL-23 signaling in the lesion tended to be lower in the AS2762900-00 group than the untreated group, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of AS2762900-00 in the psoriatic human skin xenograft model might occur via blockade of IL-23 signaling pathways. Further, AS2762900-00 showed an inhibitory effect on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation as a downstream signal of IL-23 receptor activation in whole blood from patients with psoriasis. We also confirmed that AS2762900-00 inhibited IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner using whole blood from healthy donors. These data suggest that AS2762900-00 is a  promising drug candidate for the treatment of psoriasis. In addition, STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood may be a useful biomarker for the evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effects of AS2762900-00 in healthy volunteers in clinical development.",Th17,4

Among skin-derived  pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-36 family members are highly upregulated in PV patients and play a critical role in general pustular psoriasis. However, there is limited data showing crosstalk between the IL-23 and IL-36 pathways in PV. Herein, potential attenuation of skin inflammation in the IL-23-induced mouse model of psoriasiform dermatitis by functional inhibition of IL-36 receptor (IL-36R) was interrogated. Anti-mouse IL-36R monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated and validated in vitro by inhibiting IL-36α-induced secretion of CXCL1  from NIH 3T3 cells. Antibody target engagement was demonstrated by inhibition of  CXCL1 production in a novel acute model of IL-36α systemic injection in mice. In  addition, anti-IL-36R mAbs inhibited tissue inflammation and inflammatory gene expression in an IL-36α ear injection model of psoriasiform dermatitis demonstrating engagement of the target in the ear skin. To elucidate the possible role of IL-36 signalling in IL-23/Th17 pathway, the ability of anti-IL-36R mAbs to inhibit skin inflammation in an IL-23 ear injection model was assessed. Inhibiting the IL-36 pathway resulted in significant attenuation of skin thickening and psoriasis-relevant gene expression. Taken together, these data suggest a role for IL-36 signalling in the IL-23/Th17 signalling axis in PV.",Th17,4

Extravascular low-density lipoprotein undergoes receptor uptake, whereas high-density lipoprotein (HDL) interacts with cells to acquire cholesterol and then recirculates to plasma. We developed photoactivatable apoA-I to understand how HDL passage through tissue is regulated. We focused on skin and arteries of healthy mice versus those with psoriasis, which carries cardiovascular risk in man. Our findings suggest that psoriasis-affected skin lesions program interleukin-17-producing T cells in draining lymph nodes to home to distal skin and later to arteries. There, these cells mediate thickening of the collagenous matrix, such that larger molecules including lipoproteins become entrapped. HDL transit was rescued by depleting CD4+ T cells, neutralizing interleukin-17, or inhibiting lysyl oxidase that crosslinks collagen. Experimental psoriasis also increased vascular stiffness and atherosclerosis via this common pathway. Thus, interleukin-17 can reduce lipoprotein trafficking and increase vascular stiffness by, at least in part, remodeling collagen.",Th17,4

On the other hand, Th17 cells have a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In this study, we evaluated redox status in memory CD4 + T cells and plasma of patients with psoriasis and its correlation with IL-17 response. To this end, memory T cells were isolated from 10 patients with psoriasis and 10 controls. Intracellular Glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide as well as IL-17  were measured using flow cytometry. Plasma total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) was  quantified by ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay. The expression of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1(SOD1), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2) and cytochrome b-245 beta chain (CYBB) genes were analysed using real-time PCR. Our results showed an increased intracellular ROS production in memory CD4 + T cells of patients compared to controls, (P = 0.04). Furthermore, a significant decrease in expression of catalase gene was found in patients, (P = 0.02). However, no significant differences were observed for intracellular GSH, IL-17 and TAC levels between patients and controls. Also, no correlation was seen between the intracellular IL-17 level and intracellular ROS, GSH and catalase gene expression levels. Collectively, we found an increased ROS production in stimulated memory T cells of patients that could be due to reduced expression of catalase gene.

Therefore RhoH plays critical roles in the differentiation of T cells; however, the function of RhoH in the effecter phase of the T-cell response has not been fully characterized. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the role of RhoH in inflammatory immune responses and investigated the involvement of RhoH in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. METHODS: We analyzed effector T-cell and systemic inflammation in wild-type and RhoH-null mice. RhoH expression in T cells in human PBMCs was quantified by using RT-PCR. RESULTS: RhoH deficiency in mice induced TH17 polarization during effector T-cell differentiation, thereby inducing psoriasis-like chronic dermatitis. Ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 5 (Ubr5) and nuclear receptor subfamily 2  group F member 6 (Nr2f6) expression levels decreased in RhoH-deficient T cells, resulting in increased protein levels and DNA binding activity of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt. The consequential increase in IL-17 and IL-22 production induced T cells to differentiate into TH17 cells. Furthermore, IL-22 binding protein/Fc chimeric protein reduced psoriatic inflammation in RhoH-deficient mice. Expression of RhoH in T cells was lower in patients with psoriasis with very severe symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that RhoH inhibits TH17 differentiation and thereby plays a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.

There is an increased population of Th cells in skin lesions and peripheral circulation of patients with psoriasis. Systemic methotrexate (MTX) is an effective treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis; however, its effect on different T-cell subsets is not yet clear. AIM: To study the effect of MTX monotherapy on the psoriatic T-cell profile in the peripheral circulation of patients with psoriasis. METHODS: This was a follow-up study involving 50 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated with systemic MTX for 12 weeks. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected from participants, from which PBMCs were isolated, and T-cell phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Following 12 weeks of MTX treatment, there was an increase in the percentages of Th2/Treg cells, and a relative decrease in the percentages of Th1/Th17 cells, along with a significant reduction in the median Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). CONCLUSION: MTX helps in the restoration of the immune balance by decreasing the  numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells and increasing the numbers of Th2 and Treg cells, thus resulting in a significant reduction in disease severity. MTX converts a proinflammatory T-cell phenotype to a protective anti-inflammatory phenotype, thus significantly suppressing the inflammation in psoriasis.",Th17,4

Previous studies suggested  decreased numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) with increasing stage of MF, which may lead to the shift in the Treg/Th17 balance towards the Th17 pathway. Theoretically, the use of IL-17 monoclonal antibodies to inhibit Th17 pathway may lead to further immunosuppression and disease progression in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) by shifting the balance towards Tregs, although this hypothesis has not been proven. With uncertainty over the role of IL-17 and Treg/Th17 as well as diagnostic challenges in CTCL, we recommend that patients should have a confirmatory skin biopsy prior to the commencement of biologic therapy.",Th17,4

Gene expression studies in human contact allergy focusing on immune responses revealed nickel being an inducer of T helper (Th)1/Th17 and some Th22 immune polarization, whereas fragrances were found to promote a Th2-dominated immune activation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiological association between contact allergy and psoriasis in a large multicentre cohort and to analyse the sensitization profile to specific allergens in these patients. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patch-tested patients from 56 departments of dermatology (1996-2015), including 2387 patients with psoriasis and 161 989 control patients. All patients with atopic dermatitis were excluded from both groups. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) for contact allergy was calculated to be 0·55 in patients with psoriasis (95% confidence interval 0·50-0·59). Logistic regression  analyses with several independent variables indicated a 'protective effect' of having psoriasis for most allergens, independently of age, sex, affected body site and patch test indication. Fragrance mix II (OR 0·36) and lanolin alcohols (OR 0·38) were found to be among the least common allergens in patients with psoriasis. In contrast, the frequency of contact dermatitis to nickel was only marginally affected in patients with psoriasis compared with controls (OR 0·75). CONCLUSIONS: The inverse association between psoriasis and allergic contact sensitization is likely to be not exclusively mediated by psoriasis itself. The polarization of the activated immune response by specific allergens may influence the occurrence and significance of contact allergies in underlying immune-mediated diseases, eventually even beyond the skin.",Th17,4

RESULTS: IL-23 induces Ptgs2, encoding COX2 in TH17 cells, and produces PGE2, which acts back on the PGE receptors EP2 and EP4 in these cells and enhances IL-23-induced expression of an IL-23 receptor subunit gene, Il23r, by activating  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1, and nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) through cyclic AMP-protein kinase A signaling. This PGE2 signaling also induces expression of various inflammation-related genes, which possibly function in TH17 cell-mediated pathology. Combined deletion of EP2 and EP4 selectively in T cells suppressed accumulation of IL-17A+ and IL-17A+IFN-γ+ pathogenic Th17 cells and abolished skin inflammation in an IL-23-induced psoriasis mouse model. Analysis of human psoriatic skin biopsy specimens shows positive correlation between PGE2 signaling and the IL-23/TH17 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: T cell-intrinsic EP2/EP4 signaling is critical in IL-23-driven generation of pathogenic TH17 cells and consequent pathogenesis in the skin.",Th17,4

Epub 2018 May 24.,Ichthyosis molecular fingerprinting shows profound TH17 skewing and a unique barrier genomic signature.,"BACKGROUND: Ichthyoses are a group of rare skin disorders lacking effective treatments. Although genetic mutations are progressively delineated, comprehensive molecular phenotyping of ichthyotic skin could suggest much-needed  pathogenesis-based therapy. OBJECTIVE: We sought to profile the molecular fingerprint of the most common orphan ichthyoses. METHODS: Gene, protein, and serum studies were performed on skin and blood samples from 29 patients (congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, n = 9; lamellar  ichthyosis, n = 8; epidermolytic ichthyosis, n = 8; and Netherton syndrome, n = 4), as well as age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 14), patients with psoriasis (n = 30), and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD; n = 16). RESULTS: Using criteria of a fold change of greater than 2 and a false discovery  rate of less than 0.05, 132 differentially expressed genes were shared commonly among all ichthyoses, including many IL-17 and TNF-α-coregulated genes, which are considered hallmarks of psoriasis (defensin beta 4A, kynureninase, and vanin 3).  Although striking upregulation of TH17 pathway genes (IL17F and IL36B/G) resembling that seen in patients with psoriasis was common to all patients with ichthyoses in a severity-related manner, patients with Netherton syndrome showed  the greatest T-cell activation (inducible costimulator [ICOS]) and a broader immune phenotype with TH1/IFN-γ, OASL, and TH2/IL-4 receptor/IL-5 skewing, although less than seen in patients with AD (all P < .05). Ichthyoses lacked the  epidermal differentiation and tight junction alterations of patients with AD (loricrin, filaggrin, and claudin 1) but showed characteristic alterations in lipid metabolism genes (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3 and galanin), with parallel reductions in extracellular lipids and corneocyte compaction in all ichthyoses except epidermolytic ichthyosis, suggesting phenotypic variations. Transepidermal water loss, a functional barrier measure, significantly correlated with IL-17-regulated gene expression (IL17F and IL36A/IL36B/IL36G). CONCLUSION: Similar to patients with AD and psoriasis, in whom cytokine dysregulation and barrier impairment orchestrate disease phenotypes, psoriasis-like immune dysregulation and lipid alterations characterize the ichthyoses. These data support the testing of IL-17/IL-36-targeted therapeutics for patients with ichthyosis similar to those used in patients with psoriasis.",Th17,4

Clin Rev Allergy Immunol. 2019 Feb;56(1):1-8. doi: 10.1007/s12016-018-8685-0.,The Unique Molecular Signatures of Contact Dermatitis and Implications for Treatment.,"Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) are common skin disorders that are characterized by inflammation, oozing, crusting, and pruritus. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by immune and barrier abnormalities and is additionally a risk factor for acquiring ICD and ACD. New work on allergic sensitization to common allergens (e.g., nickel and fragrance) in human skin has shown that different allergens have distinct molecular fingerprinting. For example, nickel promotes strong Th1/Th17 polarization, whereas fragrance allergy causes Th2/Th22 skewing,  which is similar to the phenotype of AD. While ACD has previously been considered to be constant across all allergens, largely based on mouse models involving strong sensitizers, these new data suggest that ACD differs mechanistically according to allergen. Further, ACD in the setting of concurrent AD shows a different and attenuated phenotype as compared to healthy individuals with ACD, which influences the way AD patients respond to vaccination and other treatment modalities. As in contact sensitization, skin challenged by food patch testing shows that common food allergens (e.g., peanut and barley) also cause distinct immune polarizations in the skin. Additionally, house dust mite reactions in human skin have been profiled to show unique Th2, Th9, and Th17/22 activation as  compared to controls, which are similar to the phenotype of psoriasis and contact responses to nickel. Given this information, ACD patients should be treated based on their unique allergen polarity. Refined understanding of the molecular behavior of contact dermatitis and related diseases translates to improved methods of inducing tolerance in sensitized allergic patients, such as with targeted drug therapy and epicutaneous immunotherapy.",Th17,4

Methods: Of 64 patients with PsA resistant to MTX, 26 underwent bDMARDs therapy selected according to phenotypic differences in peripheral helper T cells on 8-colour flow cytometry. The efficacies of this strategic treatment and the standard treatment administered to the other 38 patients were evaluated at 6 months. Results: The 26 patients with PsA in the strategic treatment group were classified into the following four types based on peripheral blood analysis: (i)  CXCR3+CCR6-CD38+HLA-DR+ activated Th1 cell-predominant type, (ii) CXCR3-CCR6+ CD38+HLA-DR+ activated Th17 cell-predominant type, (iii) Th1/Th17-high type and (iv) Th1/Th17-low type. Accordingly, ustekinumab was administered to the activated Th1 cell-predominant patients, secukinumab to the activated Th17 cell-predominant patients, secukinumab or TNF inhibitor to the Th1/Th17-high patients, and TNF inhibitor to the Th1/Th17-low patients. After 6 months of strategic treatment, there was a significant decrease in simplified disease activity index (SDAI) (from 16.2 to 3.52), DAS28 (ESR) (from 4.13 to 2.27) and psoriasis area and severity index (from 8.36 to 2.40). Low disease activity by SDAI was achieved in 24 (92.3%) of the 26 patients. The rate of low disease activity achievement according to SDAI at 6 months was significantly higher in the strategic bDMARDs treatment group compared with that of the standard bDMARDs  treatment group. Conclusion: Strategic treatment in which different bDMARDs were selected according to phenotypic differences in helper T cells showed significantly higher efficacy than standard bDMARD therapy, indicating the value of precision medicine.",Th17,4

Epub 2017 Sep 6.,Immune modulation by curcumin: The role of interleukin-10.,"Cytokines are small secreted proteins released by different types of cells with specific effects on cellular signaling and communication via binding to their receptors on the cell surface. IL-10 is known to be a pleiotropic and potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine that is produced by both innate  and adaptive immunity cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, natural killer cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, B cells, CD8+ T cells, and TH1, TH2, and TH17 and regulatory T cells. Both direct and indirect activation of the  stress axis promotes IL-10 secretion. IL-10 deregulation plays a role in the development of a large number of inflammatory diseases such as neuropathic pain,  Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and allergy. Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory compound able to induce the expression and production of IL-10 and enhancing its action on a large number of tissues. In vitro and in pre-clinical models curcumin is able to modulate the disease pathophysiology of conditions such as pain and neurodegenerative diseases, bowel inflammation, and allergy, but also of infections and cancer through its effect on IL-10 secretion. In humans, at least  one part of the positive effects of curcumin on health could be related to its ability to enhance IL-10 -mediated effects. ",Th17,4
