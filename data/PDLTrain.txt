Aims: To show the programmed death-ligand-1 expression status in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and its effect on the prognosis and the relationship with clinicopathologic data. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: The study included 208 cases who were diagnosed with NSCLC and who underwent surgical resection between 2001 and 2012. Programmed death-ligand-1 (SP142 clone) was applied to the histological sections acquired from the microarray paraffin blocks with immunohistochemistry. Staining intensity was scored as weak (+, 1), moderate (++, 2), and strong (+++, 3). Percentage (0%-100%) was multiplied by staining intensity (1-2-3) to calculate the H score.  Four different cut-off values were used; 1: ≥1% (independent of intensity), 2: ≥5% (independent of intensity), 3: ≥5% moderate/strong staining (except for weak  staining), 4: H score ≥30 values were considered positive. In this study, staining a single cell at any intensity was considered positive. Results: Thirty-four out 208 cases (16.3%) had PDL-1 positive staining. PDL-1 expression was observed in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma independent of the histological type or subtype (range; 0-25%). When the cut-off  level was set to ≥5% with moderate and strong staining, the median overall survival was 45 months for the PD-L1 positive group and not reached for the PD-L1 negative group (p-value 0.024). PD-L1 positivity was significantly higher in patients over the age of 60 years and in cases with a tumor diameter of more than 5 cm (p=0.023 and 0.025, respectively). PD-L1 expression is positive in 16.3% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and may have a negative prognostic value."

T-cell infiltration was quantified on BM biopsies from 13 patients with  AML, and flow cytometry was performed on BM aspirates (BMAs) from 107 patients with AML who received treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The authors evaluated the expression of inhibitory receptors (programmed  cell death protein 1 [PD1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA4], lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3], T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 [TIM3]) and stimulatory receptors (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein [GITR], OX40, 41BB [a type 2 transmembrane glycoprotein receptor], inducible T-cell costimulatory [ICOS]) on T-cell subsets and the expression of their ligands (41BBL, B7-1, B7-2, ICOSL, PD-L1, PD-L2, and OX40L) on AML blasts. Expression of these markers was correlated with patient age, karyotype, baseline next-generation sequencing for 28 myeloid-associated genes (including P53), and DNA methylation proteins (DNA methyltransferase 3α, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1[IDH1], IDH2, Tet methylcytosine  dioxygenase 2 [TET2], and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3]). On histochemistry evaluation, the T-cell population in BM appeared to be preserved in patients who had AML compared with healthy donors. The proportion of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in BMAs was higher in patients with AML than in healthy donors. PD1-positive/OX40-positive T cells were more frequent in AML BMAs, and a higher frequency of PD1-positive/cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive T cells coexpressed TIM3 or LAG3. PD1-positive/CD8-positive T cells were more frequent in BMAs from patients who had multiply relapsed AML than in BMAs from those who had first relapsed or newly diagnosed AML. Blasts in BMAs  from patients who had TP53-mutated AML were more frequently positive for PD-L1. The preserved T-cell population, the increased frequency of regulatory T cells, and the expression of targetable immune receptors in AML BMAs suggest a role for T-cell-harnessing therapies in AML."

In addition to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumor mutation burden (TMB), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte  (NLR) is regaining interest as a biomarker in immunotherapy for its availability, accessibility, and reproducibility. High NLR, according to different thresholds,  is consistently reported to correlate with poor prognosis in different treatments in several cancers. Yet, most data come from retrospective analysis, and proof of mechanism and principle evaluations are limited. Prospective studies or adequately sized retrospective analyses of prospectively collected data are required to best assess its role in clinical practice. Moreover, effective myeloid or neutrophil modulators in tumor microenvironment can potentially contribute as a new therapeutic strategy. This perspective will summarize our current knowledge and will discuss where we stand now and propose future directions."

OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs and PD-1 inhibitor with differed doses were applied to treat PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) assay with carboxyfluorescein diacetate/succinimidyl ester staining target cells before treatment and propidium iodide (PI) staining dead cells after treatment were conducted to detect the cytotoxic activity. DRLC mice were constructed by injection of PC9 LCSCs suspension and Matrigel into left lung of SD mice. DRLC mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 CTLs group, OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group, PD-1 inhibitor group, and OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group. In vitro, both CCK8 assay and FCM assay disclosed that OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs plus PD-1 inhibitor presented with elevated cytotoxic activity on PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. In vivo, tumor volume and tumor weight were decreased, while tumor necrosis and tumor apoptosis were increased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group than CMV pp65 CTLs group and control group, and in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group. In addition, CD8 expression was increased while OCT4&SOX2 expressions were decreased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and  PD-1 inhibitor group. In conclusion, OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs and PD-1 inhibitor presented with the synergistic effect on killing LCSCs in vitro and treating DRLC mice in vivo."

The effects of these immune checkpoint inhibitors in the older patient population has not been adequately assessed. To understand the impact of aging on CTLA-4 and PDL-1 inhibitors efficacy and immune-related adverse events (irAE) in the context of real-world management of advanced solid cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective study involved all non-study patients with histologically-confirmed metastatic or inoperable solid cancers receiving immunotherapy at Kingston Health Sciences Centre. We defined 'older patient' as age ≥ 75. All statistical analyses were conducted under SPSS IBM for Windows version 24.0. Study outcomes included immunotherapy treatment response, survival, as well as number, type, and severity of irAEs. Our study (N = 78) had 29 (37%) patients age <65, 26 (33%) patients age  65-74, and 23 (30%) patients age ≥75. Melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma accounted for 70%, 22%, and 8% of the study population, respectively. Distributions of ipilimumab (32%), nivolumab (33%), and pembrolizumab (35%) were similar in the study. The response rates were 28%, 27%,  and 39% in the age <65, age 64-74, age ≥75 groups, respectively (P = 0.585). Kaplan-Meier curve showed a median survival of 28 months (12.28-43.9, 95% CI) and 17 months (0-36.9, 95% CI) in the age <65 and age 64-74 groups, respectively; the estimated survival probability did not reach 50% in the age ≥75 group (P = 0.319). There were no statistically significant differences found in terms of irAEs, multiple irAEs, severity of grade 3 or higher, types of irAEs, and irAEs resolution status when comparing between different age groups. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that patients age ≥75 are able to gain as much benefit from immunotherapy as younger patients, without excess toxicity. Our findings suggest that single agent immunotherapy is generally well-tolerated across different age groups with no significant difference in the  type, frequency or severity of irAEs. Future studies evaluating aging and combination immunotherapy are warranted."

Epub 2018 Dec 27.","Real-World Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated with Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 Inhibitors in the Year Following U.S. Regulatory Approval.","Evidence from cancer clinical trials has strong internal validity but can be difficult to generalize to real-world patient populations. Here we analyzed real-world outcomes of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in the first year following U.S. regulatory approval. This retrospective study leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data collected during routine patient care in community cancer care  clinics. The cohort included patients with mNSCLC who had received nivolumab or pembrolizumab for metastatic disease (n = 1,344) with >1 EHR-documented visit from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2016. Patients with a > 90-day gap between advanced disease diagnosis and first EHR structured data entry were excluded. Estimated median overall survival (OS) was 8.0 months (95% confidence interval 7.4-9.0 months). Estimated median OS was 4.7 months (3.4-6.6) for patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement- and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive tumors, and 8.6 months (7.7-10.6) for patients  without such mutations. Age at PD-1 inhibitor initiation or line of therapy did not impact OS. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests OS in real-world patients may be shorter than  in conventional clinical trial patient cohorts, potentially due to narrow trial eligibility criteria. The lack of difference in OS by line of therapy or age at immunotherapy initiation suggests sustained benefit of PD-1 inhibitors in multitreated patients with mNSCLC and that age is not a predictor of outcome. Further studies are underway in patients with comorbidities, organ dysfunction, and multiple prior therapies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study evaluated data derived from electronic health records of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in the year following regulatory approval. This real-world cohort had shorter overall survival (OS) indexed to PD-1 inhibitor initiation than reported in clinical trials. Late-line  treatment did not influence OS, and patients aged >75 at immunotherapy initiation did not have worse outcomes than younger patients. As new therapies enter clinical practice, real-world data can complement clinical trial evidence providing information on generalizability and helping inform clinical treatment decisions."

The clinical features, PD-L1 tumor proportion scores, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (PDi) outcomes (objective response rate and progression-free survival)  of patients who had advanced NSCLC with Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations or common, actionable oncogenic drivers were captured. In total, 189 oncogene-positive patients were analyzed. Of these, 104 received a PDi, and 108 had undergone prior PD-L1 testing. The frequency of PD-L1 positivity (≥1%) was higher in patients who had KRAS mutations (P = .031), smokers (P = .006), and non-Asian patients (P = .002). Multivariable analysis indicated that smoking status (P < .001) was the only factor associated significantly with KRAS mutation. The objective response rate to PDi treatment was 16.9% (11 of 65 patients) among smokers (17.3% in the KRAS-mutant and 15.4% in the non-KRAS-mutant smoker subgroups), which was significantly higher than the 0% rate (0 of 26 patients; P = .019) among never-smokers. In subgroup analyses, progression-free survival was influenced by KRAS mutation status (median, 4.57 vs 1.63 months; P = .004), smoking status (4.07 vs 1.73 months; P = .004), PD-L1 positivity (3.8 vs 1.2 months; P = .040), and non-Asian race (3.0 vs 1.97 months; P = .046). In multivariable analysis, only smoking status (P = .008) remained a significant predictor when a PD-L1 level ≥1% was used. However, both smoking status (P = .001) and PD-L1 status (P = .028) were independent predictors when a  PD-L1 level ≥50% was used. Among associated clinical features among patients who have NSCLC with oncogenic drivers, smoking status potentially was the most important, easily available predictor of single PDi efficacy."

Epub 2018 Nov 27.","Immunohisto(cyto)chemistry: an old time classic tool driving modern oncological therapies.","In the era of precision medicine immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) share some of the highlights in personalized treatment. Survival data obtained from clinical trials shape the cut-offs and IHC scoring that serve as recommendations for patient selection both for targeted and conventional therapies. Assessment of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors along with HER2 status has been among the first approved immunostaining assays revolutionizing breast cancer treatment. Similarly, ALK positivity predicts the efficacy of ALK inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In recent years, Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC assays have been approved  as companion or complimentary diagnostic tools predicting the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have inaugurated a new period in the treatment of advanced cancers, but the path to approval of these biomarkers is filled with immunohistochemical challenges. The latter brings to the fore the significance of molecular pathology as a hub between basic and clinical research. Besides, novel markers are translated into routine practice, suggesting that we are at the beginning of a new exciting period. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular homeostasis unfolds biomarkers with greater specificity and sensitivity. The introduction of  GL13 (SenTraGor®) for the detection of senescent cells in archival material, the  implementation of key players of stress response pathways and the development of  compounds detecting common mutant P53 isoforms in dictating oncological treatments are paradigms for precision oncology."

We explored the relationship of PD-L1 and malignant behavior in 77 cases of PCC/PGL using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess protein expression and RNAscope to detect mRNA expression in 20 cases. The IHC data showed that 59.74% of the PCCs/PGLs expressed PD-L1, and the  extent of expression was highly correlated with Ki-67 (P = .019) and hypertension (P = .013) but not with age, sex, tumor size, capsular invasion, tumor necrosis,  relapse/distant metastasis, secretion of noradrenaline/adrenaline/dopamine, or diabetes mellitus. In addition, we found an excellent correlation of PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression with a κ coefficient of 0.828, and further stratification  of the IHC and RNAscope findings showed high consistency (Pearson coefficient 0.753). The correlation of PD-L1 and Ki-67 indicated that PD-L1 could be considered a malignant proliferation biomarker for PCCs/PGLs, which would be a putative biomarker for anti-PD-L1 therapies."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab for  pretreated patients with non-small cell lung cancers in clinical practice. In this observational monocentric retrospective study, 98 patients were enrolled between February 2015 and February 2016. The global median overall survival was 6.34 months (95% confidence interval (CI) : 4.11-10.88) and the global median progression free survival was 1.84 months (95% CI: 1.68-2.73). In the univariate  analysis, clinical performance status score was the only factor significantly correlated with overall survival. The safety profile of nivolumab is consistent with that described in prior studies, with only 7% undesirable effects requiring  the discontinuation of treatment. The results of the present study demonstrate that nivolumab affords clinical efficacy and manageable tolerability in patients  with non-small cell lung cancers."

Unfortunately, the management of  steroid-refractory immune mediated adverse events is based on a paucity of randomized data and limited to single center experiences. Our initial experience  with the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab showed clinical improvement in a wide variety of irAEs. As a result, we adopted the use of tocilizumab for the management of steroid refractory irAEs. The character and clinical course of irAEs were abstracted from the medical record and analyzed. The dose of tocilizumab was 4 mg/kg given IV over one hour. C-reactive protein was drawn at first nivolumab infusion and at q two weeks (and with irAEs) thereafter. Clinical improvement was defined as either: documentation of resolution of symptoms or hospital discharge within seven days. Of the initial 87 patients that were treated with nivolumab, 34 required tocilizumab (39.1%). All patients were on corticosteroids. The majority (88.2%) were lung cancer patients. The index grade 3/4 irAE was pneumonitis in 35.3%, serum sickness/SIRS in 35.3%, cerebritis in 14.7% and one case each of hypophysitis, colitis, pancreatitis, hepatitis and immune mediated coagulopathy.  Median time between first nivolumab and initiation of tocilizumab was 76 days (range 1-429). There was a statistically significant increase in C-reactive protein from a median of 23 mg/L (range 0.1-238.5) at baseline to 109.3 mg/L (21.5-350.4) at the time of index irAE, followed by a decrease to 19.2 mg/L (0.25-149) after tocilizumab ( p < 0.00001). Clinical improvement was noted in 27/34 patients (79.4%). Some patients (52.9%) required a single dose, while 38.2% required two, 8.8% required three and 1 patient required four doses. Twenty-seven doses were given in the inpatient setting (49.1%). Median time to discharge was four days (range 1-27). Seventy-four percent of patients were discharged home. For the 53 doses of tocilizumab that were delivered when infliximab was an option, there was a cost savings of $141,048.72 (WAC) during the 18 month study period. Tocilizumab may be a therapeutic option for the management of steroid refractory irAEs secondary to immune checkpoint blockade. However, randomized trials are needed to better elucidate the relative efficacy and safety of these agents."

Eligibility criteria stipulated histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC and treatment failure on ≥1 prior systemic therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted therapy for patients with EGFR/ALK aberrations). In the dose-finding cohort, patients initially received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 or 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy for up to 2 years. Based on emerging published data, subsequent patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. Objective response rate (ORR; primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded, independent central review. Phase 2 hypothesis that ORR would be greater than the 20% rate for historical controls was evaluated using the exact binomial test. Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 71% received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at any dose level. Among patients who received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 44), ORR was 30%  (95% CI, 17%-45%), but not statistically significantly >20% (P = 0.0858). Median  progression-free survival in this group was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.4-5.8) months; median  overall survival was 10.9 (95% CI, 6.1-23.7) months.

Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression may serve as a predictive marker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The relationship between non-small cell lung cancer PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics remains unclear and there is no population level Australian data. We report the results of PD-L1 testing in patients with non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed at major Western Australian public hospitals served by a single  state Pathology provider. We analyzed PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 241 non-small cell lung cancer specimens using the 22C3 clone on a Dako autostainer platform. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression was scored as Tumor Proportion  Score and categorized using pre-specified subsets of  1%, 1-49% and  ≥  50% for correlation with clinicopathologic features. PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was  1% in 65 (27%) cases, 1-49% in 100 (41%) cases and  ≥  50% in 76 (32%) cases. PD-L1-positive rate was 92% in squamous cell carcinomas and 67% in adenocarcinomas. PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was higher in squamous cell carcinomas (p  =  0.004) and lower in adenocarcinomas (p  =  0.003). Of the 196 non-squamous carcinomas, 35% had rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) mutations, 13% had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, 2% had anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations and 2% had ROS1 translocations. Tumor Proportion Score  ≥  50% was seen in 34% (23/68), 28% (7/25) and 25% (1/4)  of RAS, EGFR mutant, and ALK translocated carcinomas, respectively. There was no  significant correlation between PD-L1 expression and molecular or genetic abnormalities, or other parameters including age, gender, stage, and smoking status. In our patient cohort, PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas and lower in adenocarcinomas. The overall prevalence of Tumor Proportion Score  ≥  50% is consistent with that reported in  clinical trials."

However, IDO1 expression has not been well studied in lung adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 and IDO1 expression was evaluated in 261 resected lung adenocarcinomas using tissue microarrays and H-scores (cutoff: 5). We compared IDO1 and PD-L1 expression with clinical features, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, HLA class I molecule expression, molecular alterations, and patient outcomes. There was expression of PD-L1 in 89 (34%) and IDO1 in 74 (29%) cases, with co-expression in 49 (19%). Both PD-L1 and IDO1 were significantly associated with smoking, aggressive pathologic features, and abundant CD8+ and T-bet+ (Th1 marker) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. PD-L1 expression was also associated with preserved HLA class I molecule expression (p = 0.002). Compared to PD-L1+/IDO1+ and PD-L1+ only cases, significantly fewer IDO1+ only cases had abundant CD8+ and T-bet+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (p < 0.001, respectively). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with EGFR wild-type (p < 0.001) and KRAS mutants (p = 0.021), whereas isolated IDO1 expression was significantly associated with EGFR mutations (p = 0.007). As for survival, PD-L1 was a significant predictor of decreased progression-free and overall survival by univariate but not multivariate analysis, while IDO1 was not associated with progression-free or overall survival. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the 5-year progression-free and overall survival (p = 0.004 and 0.038, respectively), where  cases without PD-L1 or IDO1 expression had the longest survival, and those with PD-L1 alone had the shortest survival. While PD-L1+/-IDO1 expression is observed  in association with HLA class I expression, cytotoxic T lymphocyte/Th1 microenvironments, EGFR wild-type, and KRAS mutations, isolated IDO1 expression does not demonstrate these associations, suggesting that IDO1 may serve a distinct immunosuppressive role in lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, further investigation of IDO1 may demonstrate its role as a potential biomarker for patients who undergo anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy."

PD-L1 expression detected by immunohistochemistry  is the first clinically validated predictive biomarker for response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, though its predictive value varies significantly between tumor types. With the approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy for treatment-naïve, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, PD-L1 testing has to become broadly available in pathology laboratories. When PD-L1 testing started to be introduced in routine pathology practice, there were several open issues, which needed to be addressed  in order to provide accurate results. This review will discuss the complex biological background of PD-L1 as predictive biomarker, summarize relevant clinical trials in NSCLC illustrating the origin of different PD-L1 expression cutoffs and scorings, and address issues important for PD-L1 testing including the analytical comparability of the different clinical trial-validated PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays, the potential of laboratory-developed tests, and an  overview of the different scoring algorithms."

Here, we report that ultrasensitive measures of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and T-cell expansion can be used to assess responses to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic lung cancer patients (N = 24). Patients with clinical response to therapy had a complete reduction in ctDNA levels after initiation of therapy, whereas nonresponders had no significant changes or an increase in ctDNA levels.  Patients with initial response followed by acquired resistance to therapy had an  initial drop followed by recrudescence in ctDNA levels. Patients without a molecular response had shorter progression-free and overall survival compared with molecular responders [5.2 vs. 14.5 and 8.4 vs. 18.7 months; HR 5.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.57-18.35; P = 0.007 and HR 6.91; 95% CI, 1.37-34.97;  P = 0.02, respectively], which was detected on average 8.7 weeks earlier and was  more predictive of clinical benefit than CT imaging. Expansion of T cells, measured through increases of T-cell receptor productive frequencies, mirrored ctDNA reduction in response to therapy. We validated this approach in an independent cohort of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (N = 14), where the therapeutic effect was measured by pathologic assessment of residual tumor after anti-PD1 therapy. Consistent with our initial findings, early ctDNA dynamics predicted pathologic response to immune checkpoint blockade. These analyses provide an approach for rapid determination of therapeutic outcomes for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and have important implications for the development of personalized immune targeted strategies.Significance: Rapid and sensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA dynamic changes and T-cell expansion can be used to guide immune targeted therapy for patients with lung cancer.See related commentary by Zou and Meyerson, p. 1038."

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer in a phase 1 trial. The associations between candidate biomarkers (programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression, mismatch repair status, tumor mutation load, and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels) and the efficacy of SHR-1210 were also explored. Thirty patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma  who were refractory or intolerant to previous chemotherapy were enrolled between  June 2, 2016, and June 8, 2017. Seven patients (23.3%) demonstrated objective responses, including 1 complete response. The objective response rates for patients with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors were 23.1% (3 of 13) and 26.7% (4 of 15), respectively (P = 1.000). Two treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported: one was grade 3 pruritus, and the other (3.3%) was grade 5 interstitial lung disease. All 20 patients tested for the mismatch repair status had mismatch repair-proficient tumors, and the response rate was 30.0% (95% confidence interval, 11.9%-54.3%). Patients with a higher mutation load (4 of 10) tended to have better responses than those with fewer mutations (2 of 10), but the difference was not significant (P = .628). Patients  with a >10% relative increase from the baseline LDH level were more likely to experience disease progression (90% [9 of 10]) than patients with a ≤10% change (40% [8 of 20]; P = .017). Anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 shows encouraging efficacy in patients with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer in China, including mismatch repair-proficient subgroups."

PD-L1 is a  co-inhibitory molecule whose expression on the surface of tumor cells is associated with worse prognosis in many tumors. Here we describe a splice variant (secPD-L1) that does not splice into the transmembrane domain, but instead produces a secreted form of PD-L1 that has a unique 18 amino acid tail containing a cysteine that allows it to homodimerize and more effectively inhibit lymphocyte function than monomeric soluble PD-L1. We show that recombinant secPD-L1 can dimerize and inhibit T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production in vitro. The  secPD-L1 variant is expressed by malignant cells in vitro that also express high  levels of full-length PD-L1. Transcriptomic analysis of gene expression across The Cancer Genome Atlas found the strongest association of secPD-L1 with full-length PD-L1, but also with subsets of immunologic genes, such as in myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, the splice variant is also expressed  in normal tissues and within normal peripheral blood cells it is preferentially expressed in activated myeloid cells. This is the first report of a form of secreted PD-L1 that homodimerizes and is functionally active. SecPD-L1 may function as a paracrine negative immune regulator within the tumor, since secPD-L1 does not require a cell-to-cell interaction to mediate its inhibitory effect."

We previously identified a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with human papillomavirus integration in the PD-L1 locus upstream of the transmembrane domain-encoding region, suggesting expression of a truncated form of PD-L1 (Parfenov et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111(43):15544-15549, 2014). In this study, we extended this observation by performing a computational  analysis of 33 other cancer types as well as human cancer cell lines, and identified additional PD-L1 isoforms with an exon 4 enrichment expressed in 20 cancers and human cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that cancer cell lines with high expression levels of exon 4-enriched PD-L1 generate a secreted form of PD-L1. Further biochemical studies of exon 4-enriched PD-L1 demonstrated that this form is secreted and maintains the capacity to bind PD-1 as well as to serve as a negative regulator on T cell function, as measured by inhibition of IL-2 and IFNg secretion. Overall, we have demonstrated that truncated forms of PD-L1 exist in numerous cancer types, and have validated that truncated PD-L1 can be secreted and negatively regulate T cell function."

PD-L1 expression was highly concordant with several genomic signatures indicative of immune-inflamed tumor microenvironment. Prevalence of activated immune-inflamed tumors across all tumor types was explored and used to rank tumor types for potential response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. The analysis yielded 3 tiers of indications in which high levels of PD-L1 and immune-inflamed signatures were found in up to 40% to 60%, 20% to 40%,  and 0% to 20% of tumors. Tier 1 contained novel indications known at the time of  analysis to be responsive to PD-1 checkpoint blockade in the clinic (such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer), as well as indications not studied in the clinic previously, including microsatellite instability-high colorectal, head and neck, bladder, and triple-negative breast cancers. Complementary analysis of  an Asian/Pacific cancer dataset (gastric cancer) revealed high prevalence of immune-inflamed tumors in gastric cancer. These data contributed to prioritization of these indications for clinical development of pembrolizumab as  monotherapy.

TMB scores were determined retrospectively for 72 consecutive patients at our institution with next-generation sequencing comprehensive genomic profiling testing by Foundation Medicine. TMB scores were correlated with a number of clinical variables and presence of DNA repair mutations. Thirty-four patients were treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapies, and survival analyses based on TMB score were performed. In addition, tissue immunohistochemical analysis was performed for a subset of patients. History of smoking, but not other clinical variables, including prior treatment lines, stage of disease, and number of metastatic sites, predicted higher TMB score. Higher TMB score was significantly associated with greater number of DNA repair mutations. In the subset of patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade, higher TMB score significantly predicted overall survival, but not progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.10, P = .003; hazard ratio 1.1, P = .84, respectively). In a small subset of patients, PD-1/PD-L1 staining did not independently predict progression-free survival or overall survival. CONCLUSION: Tissue TMB was significantly associated with smoking history and number of DNA repair mutations. TMB is a promising biomarker for response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, with higher TMB score predicting longer overall survival."

Recent studies have revealed a significant role of programed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) in negatively controlling the production of CD4+ T helper  type 2 (Th2) cytokines and airway hypersensitiveness, suggesting hypo-responsive  Th2 cells via the PD-1/PD-L2 inhibitory pathway in lung could be reawaken by PD-1 blockade therapy. We describe the first report of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), which is known as Th2-associated pulmonary disease, triggered by nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in an advanced non-small cell lung cancer patient. Based on the current case report and literature, the present study proposes a potential mechanism of the onset of AEP as an immune-related adverse event (irAE). A 62-year-old man was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and nivolumab was selected as the third-line regimen. After three cycles of nivolumab treatment, chest computed tomography revealed pulmonary infiltrates in both lungs. The patient was diagnosed with AEP based on the diagnostic criteria for AEP. Nivolumab was suspended and the patient was started on oral prednisolone. His symptoms and radiological findings had rapidly improved. Given the increasing frequency of the use of anti-PD-1 antibodies, clinicians should be aware of the risk of AEP as a potential irAE. This study may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying Th2-associated irAEs  and AEP."

Here we examined the association between soluble immune mediators and the outcome of treatment with PD-1 inhibitors in patients with advanced/recurrent NSCLC. In two independent cohorts, we assessed the levels of 88 different soluble immune mediators in peripheral blood before and after anti-PD-1 treatment, and evaluated their associations with clinical outcomes. In the training cohort, the plasma levels of chitinase 3-like-1 and GM-CSF before treatment (p = 0.006 and p = 0.005, respectively) and changes in the plasma levels of CXCL2, VEGF, IFNα2, and  MMP2 after treatment (p < 0.001, p = 0.019, p = 0.019, and p = 0.012, respectively) were significantly correlated with PFS.

Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that was recently developed for cancer immunotherapy with remarkable responses in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients. We present a 62-year-old Caucasian male with recurrent lung adenocarcinoma and currently under third-line therapy with nivolumab, who was admitted in our hospital with abdominal distension. Radiologic findings were consistent with small bowel ileus. After four days of conservative treatment, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy where no cause of ileus was discovered.  Postoperative the ileus persisted and considering that an adverse effect of the immune checkpoint inhibition therapy occurred, the patient received high-dose prednisone resulting in gradual improvement of symptoms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors may induce adverse effects to unaffected organ systems and tissues including the skin, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, and endocrine system. The mainstay treatment consists of immunosuppression with corticosteroids in the  majority of cases. As the clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is expanding rapidly, there is an emergence of unique immune-related adverse effects in a growing patient population.

However, primary/acquired resistance hampers its efficacy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to improve checkpoint blockade therapy. Here we tested whether dual inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epidermal  growth factor receptor (EGFR) by flavonoid melafolone improves program death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade therapy through normalizing tumor vasculature and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) downregulation. Virtual screening assay, cellular thermal shift assay, and enzyme inhibition assay identified melafolone as a potential inhibitor of COX-2 and EGFR. In Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and CMT167 models, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR by melafolone promoted survival, tumor growth inhibition, and vascular normalization, and ameliorated CD8+ T-cell suppression,  accompanied by the downregulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and PD-L1 in the tumor cells. Mechanistically, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR in lung cancer cells by melafolone increased the migration of pericyte, decreased the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and enhanced the proliferation and effector function of CD8+ T cells through VEGF, TGF-β, or PD-L1 downregulation and PI3K/AKT inactivation. Notably, melafolone improved PD-1 immunotherapy against LLC and CMT167 tumors. Together, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR by melafolone  improves checkpoint blockade therapy through vascular normalization and PD-L1 downregulation and, by affecting vessels and immune cells, may be a promising combination strategy for the treatment of human lung cancer."

We conducted a 15-center retrospective cohort study of previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC who received nivolumab monotherapy. For the  patients who showed pseudoprogression, we defined progression-free survival 1 (PFS1) as the time to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined first  progressive disease and progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) as the time to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined second progressive disease or death. Among the 542 patients included, 20% and 53% showed a typical response and progression, respectively. Of the 14 (3%) patients who showed pseudoprogression, most (n = 10) showed a response within 3 months of nivolumab treatment. The median PFS1 and PFS2 were 1.0 and 7.3 months, respectively. The median PFS2 was significantly shorter in the patients who showed pseudoprogression than the PFS of the patients with a typical response (p < 0.001). In contrast, patients showing pseudoprogression had significantly longer overall survival than did patients showing typical progression (p = 0.001). Pseudoprogression was uncommon, and the duration of response in patients who showed pseudoprogression was shorter than that in patients who showed a typical response.

Thirty-eight pretreatment and two post-treatment specimens from 36 advanced, treatment-refractory non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent  PD-1 blockade therapy were analyzed. PD-L1 expression by tumor cells and the distribution of CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3 and PD-1 positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were immunohistochemically assessed and counted using digital image analyzer. CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were distributed more in PD-L1 positive group compared to PD-L1 negative group. Conversely, EGFR mutant group showed fewer CD3+ T cells than EGFR-naïve group. The patients in the clinical benefit group with PD-1 blockade showed a higher number of CD3+, CD8+ T cells and a higher CD8+/CD3+ T cell ratio (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, and p = 0.042) and a lower FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio compared to non-responders (p = 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, increased CD3+ T cell infiltration and low FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio were found to be independent predictors of clinical benefit with PD-1 blockade (p = 0.014 and p = 0.03, respectively). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, levels of CD3+ T cells and FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio that provide the best distinguishing point between responder versus non-responder to PD-1 blockade were 617.5/mm2 and 25%, respectively (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003). Considering that 1 mm2 is about 5 high power fields (HPF), a good response to the PD-1 blockade can be expected when the number of CD3 T cells is observed to be 120 per HPF and when CD8+ T cells and FOXP3+ T cells are present at a ratio greater than 4:1. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes might become a promising biomarker as an independent predictive factor of response to PD-1 blockade that may also guide therapeutic decisions."

Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) is a coinhibitory receptor associated with impaired T-cell function and is frequently coexpressed with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) in the context of human cancers. Targeting LAG-3 in conjunction with PD-1 thus represents a strategy to amplify and broaden  the therapeutic impact of PD-1 blockade alone. We have generated a high affinity  and selective humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody, TSR-033, which binds human LAG-3 and serves as a functional antagonist, enhancing in vitro T-cell activation both in mixed lymphocyte reactions and staphylococcal enterotoxin B-driven stimulation assays. In a humanized mouse non-small cell lung carcinoma model, TSR-033 boosted the antitumor efficacy of PD-1 monotherapy, with a concomitant increase in immune activation. Analogous studies in a murine syngeneic tumor model using surrogate antibodies demonstrated significant synergy between LAG-3 and PD-1 blockade-combination treatment led to a marked improvement in therapeutic efficacy, increased T-cell proliferation, IFNγ production, and elicited durable immunologic memory upon tumor rechallenge. Taken together, the pharmacologic activity of TSR-033 demonstrates that it is a potent anti-LAG-3 therapeutic antibody and supports its clinical investigation in cancer patients."

The chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel  (PTX), the anti-CSC agent thioridazine (THZ), and the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor HY19991 (HY) are all incorporated into an enzyme/pH dual-sensitive nanoparticle with a micelle-liposome double-layer structure. The particle size shrinks when the nanoparticle transfers from circulation to tumor tissues, favoring both pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake, meanwhile achieving sequential drug release where needed. This nano device, named PM@THL, increases the intratumoral drug concentrations in mice and exhibits significant anticancer efficacy, with tumor inhibiting rate of 93.45% and lung metastasis suppression rate of 97.64%. It also reduces the proportion of CSC and enhances the T cells infiltration in tumor tissues, and thus prolongs the survival of mice.

Relapse of hematologic malignancy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation limits the success of this approach, and PD-1 blockade may hold therapeutic promise. However, PD-1 expression and its  relationship with post-transplant relapse is poorly described. Because the donor  immunity is activated by alloresponses, PD-1 expression may differ from nontransplanted individuals, and PD-1 blockade could risk graft-versus-host disease. Here we analyzed T-cell exhaustion marker kinetics and their relationship with leukemia relapse in 85 patients undergoing myeloablative T-cell-depleted HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 35 (44%) patients relapsed. PD-1 expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells was comparably elevated in relapsed and nonrelapsed cohorts. Helios+ regulatory T cells and CD8 effector memory cells at day 30 emerged as independent predictors of relapse. Although leukemia antigen-specific T cells did not overexpress PD-1,  single-cell analysis revealed LAG3 and TIM3 overexpression at relapse. These findings indicate that PD-1 is an unreliable marker for leukemia-specific T-cell  exhaustion in relapsing patients but implies other exhaustion markers and suppressor cells as relapse biomarkers."

Immune response has long been a question of great interest in a wide range of fields such as cancer therapies and anti-tumor  immunity through checkpoint inhibitors, specifically anti PD-1/ PD-L1 interaction, is a new line of research for treatment of CRC patients. Following the successful development of anti-PD-1 for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, several clinical trials have been conducted on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PD-1 in CRC. There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of anti-PD-1 therapy for MSI (Microsatellite instability) tumors among CRC subtypes. We present a comprehensive knowledge of immune therapy through PD-1/PD-L1 blockade that argues how efficient the process is, in colon cancer carcinoma. In this review, we discuss the responsiveness of immunotherapy on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and various tactics for overcoming weak responses to these checkpoint inhibitors in CRC. More research using controlled trials is required to enable new discoveries to provide continued success with immune-based therapies and grounds for optimism about the  future of CRC patients."

Neither clinicopathologic features nor biological mechanisms associated with HP have been identified. Among 187 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICI at our institute, cases with HP were identified according to clinical and radiologic criteria. Baseline histologic samples from patients treated with ICI were evaluated by IHC for myeloid and lymphoid markers. T-cell-deficient mice, injected with human lung cancer cells and patient-derived  xenografts (PDX) belonging to specific mutational subsets, were assessed for tumor growth after treatment with antibodies against mouse and human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). The immune microenvironment was evaluated by flow cytometry and IHC. Among 187 patients, 152 were evaluable for clinical response. We identified four categories: 32 cases were defined as responders (21%), 42 patients with stable disease (27.7%), 39 cases were defined as progressors (25.7%), and 39 patients with HP (25.7%). Pretreatment tissue samples from all patients with HP showed tumor infiltration by M2-like CD163+CD33+PD-L1+ clustered epithelioid macrophages. Enrichment by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) was observed, even in tumor nodules from immunodeficient mice injected with human lung cancer cells and with PDXs. In these models, tumor growth was enhanced by treatment with anti-PD-1 but not anti-PD-1 F(ab)2 fragments. These results suggest a crucial role of TAM reprogramming, upon Fc receptor engagement by ICI, eventually inducing HP and provide clues on a distinctive immunophenotype potentially able to predict HP.See related commentary by Knorr and Ravetch, p. 904."

Unlike cytotoxic chemotherapy, drugs such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab are associated with immune-related adverse effects. We recently observed a patient with lung cancer who developed a fulminant warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Investigate the frequency and prognosis of AIHA secondary to CPI in a public database and review the literature. A total of 68 cases were identified in the database of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 43 were associated with nivolumab, 13 with pembrolizumab, seven with ipilimumab, and five with atezolizumab. All episodes of AIHA were listed as serious. If the total number of adverse events cases reported to the FDA is taken as a reference, AIHA is rare, but occurred more frequently with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents (0.15%-0.25%) than with CTLA-4 inhibitors (0.06%). In addition to our case, the literature review identified 11 similar cases. Most cases of AIHA responded to steroids, but two of 12 were fatal. CONCLUSION: We describe AIHA as a new and serious immune-related side effect of CPI. Early aggressive management is necessary."

ICI are approved for the treatment of malign melanoma, non-small  cell lung cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. They can lead to long-term anti-tumor responses by deactivating the brake mechanism in the immune  system. Ipilimumab, tremelimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are examples of ICI. CTLA-4 is a brake mechanism in immune response. Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are antibodies against CTLA-4. PD-1  is another important immune checkpoint co-inhibitor receptor that is expressed by activated T cells in the peripheral tissue. As a result of blockage of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, local tumor-specific immune response augments, and long-term  tumor control can be achieved. In recent years, ICI are approved for the treatment of various malignities. They may be responsible for specific toxicities called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs are a consequence infiltration of normal tissues by activated T lymphocytes that are responsible for autoimmunity. Corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, such as  infliximab and mycophenolate mofetil, are effective in the treatment of irAEs. Immune checkpoint inhibition with monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1 by single agent or combination treatments became a new option in various solid tumors. However, ICI have unique adverse events, and these adverse  events should be considered in any new onset clinical situation and should be managed properly. Future prospective randomized clinical trials will clarify recent questions."

Associations between these biomarkers and the clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a clinical trial that encompassed 20 cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors. KEYNOTE-028 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054806) is a nonrandomized, phase Ib trial that enrolled 475 patients with PD-L1-positive advanced solid tumors who were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks  for 2 years or until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; by RECIST v1.1, investigator review). Secondary end points included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Relationships between T-cell-inflamed  GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB and antitumor activity were exploratory end points. ORRs (with 95% CIs) ranged from 0% (0.0% to 14.2%) in pancreatic cancer  to 33% (15.6% to 55.3%) in small-cell lung cancer. Across cohorts, median (95% CI) PFS ranged from 1.7 months (1.5 to 2.9 months) to 6.8 months (1.9 to 14.1 months) in pancreatic and thyroid cancers, respectively, and median OS from 3.9 months (2.8 to 5.5 months) to 21.1 months (9.1 to 22.4 months) in vulvar and carcinoid tumors, respectively. Higher response rates and longer PFS were demonstrated in tumors with higher T-cell-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and/or  TMB. Correlations of TMB with GEP and PD-L1 were low. Response patterns indicate  that patients with tumors that had high levels of both TMB and inflammatory markers (GEP or PD-L1) represent a population with the highest likelihood of response. Safety was similar and consistent with prior pembrolizumab reports. CONCLUSION: A T-cell--inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB predicted response  to pembrolizumab in multiple tumor types. These biomarkers (alone/in combination) may help identify patients who have a higher likelihood of response to anti-PD-1  therapies across a broad spectrum of cancers."

Therefore, it is important to elucidate the clinical and pathological features of tumors with IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and the association between IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and efficacy of combination therapy in NSCLC patients. In this study, we examined the prognostic impact of IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and its relationship with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in primary lung squamous  cell carcinoma (SCC). The expression levels of IDO1, PD-L1, Ki-67, cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), CD4, and CD8 in 202 patients with surgically resected primary lung SCC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Among 202 patients, 176 (87.1%) were positive for IDO1 expression, 106 (52.5%) were positive for PD-L1 expression, and 99 (49.0%) showed co-expression of IDO1/PD-L1 proteins. Fisher's exact test showed a significant association between IDO1 and PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (P =  0.0011). Kaplan-Meier curve  showed that PD-L1 alone and co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 were significantly associated with shorter overall survival, but IDO1 alone was not (log rank test:  P =  0.0122, P =  0.0303 and P =  0.5168, respectively). The Ki-67 labeling index was significantly higher in patients with co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 than in patients without co-expression (Student's t-test: P =  0.0005). Moreover, IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression was significantly associated with high CD3, CD4, and CD8 expression (Fisher's exact test: P =  0.0033, P =  0.0003, and P <  0.0001, respectively).

We performed a trial-based correlative analysis to evaluate conventional endpoints as surrogates for predicting OS in ICI-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. A systematic electronic literature search for randomized clinical trials using ICI monotherapies for NSCLC revealed 7 trials. The correlative analysis to  clarify the correlations among clinical outcomes used a weighted Spearman rank correlation coefficient (wS), weighted Pearson correlation coefficient (wP), and  weighted linear regression model (wL) in all patients and patients with high PD-L1 expression. The correlative analysis of the total population revealed that the odds  ratio of the ORR (OR-ORR) and the hazard ratio of OS (HR-OS) were strongly correlated with the hazard ratio of PFS (HR-PFS) (R for wP and wS, R2 for wL; -0.869, -0.968, 0.756 between OR-ORR and HR-PFS; 0.923, 0.959, 0.851 between HR-PFS and HR-OS). The strongest correlation was observed between one-year overall survival (1y-OS) and the HR-OS (R for wP and wS, R2 for wL; 0.985, 1.000, R2: 0.968). In those with high PD-L1 expression, the ORR and PFS were strongly associated with OS (R2: 0.842 between ORR and OS; 0.771 between PFS and OS). The OR-ORR and HR-PFS could serve as surrogate endpoints for predicting the HR-OS in randomized trials using ICIs for NSCLC, while the ORR and PFS could be useful endpoints for predicting OS in trials with patient selection  based on high PD-L1 expression."

The present report describes a 71-year-old man with clear cell renal cell carcinoma metastasis in the lung. Following the 14th course of nivolumab therapy, the patient complained of general malaise, loss of appetite and mild consciousness disturbance. Laboratory tests revealed a severely elevated eosinophil ratio (26.2%) and low sodium value (122 mmol/l). Endocrine system tests revealed that the patient's adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 4.5 pg/ml) and cortisol (0.1 µg/dl) levels were lower than normal, while those of other pituitary hormones were higher than normal. This case was therefore diagnosed as  isolated ACTH deficiency induced by nivolumab. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal pituitary glands. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy improved the clinical symptoms early and enabled the patient to restart nivolumab therapy. Isolated ACTH deficiency due to nivolumab, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, is a rare occurrence. This report may be useful for avoiding delays in  the diagnosis and treatment of this life-threatening irAE even if no pituitary abnormalities are identified via MRI."

Regarding infectious complications, it has emerged that these compounds do not intrinsically increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections, which mainly correlate with the co-administration of systemic immunosuppressive therapy (high-dose corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factors inhibitors) to cure immune-related adverse events (colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and pancreatitis), well-known complications of these targeted drugs. These observations lead experts' opinion to suggest primary anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis in patients undergoing CTLA-4 and PD-1/PDL1 agents who will receive prednisone 20 mg daily for ≥ 4 weeks. Few data on invasive fungal infections in this context are available. We report here a case of probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (p-IPA) complicating first-line immunotherapy with pembrolizumab for metastatic lung cancer that was further aggravated by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa superinfection of fungal cavities; the patient received concurrent systemic corticosteroid therapy as anti-edema treatment for cerebral metastases.  Reviewing literature about Aspergillus diseases in subjects receiving CTLA-4 and  PD-1 and PDL1-targeted agents, we found three cases of invasive aspergillosis and one case of exacerbation of chronic progressive pulmonary aspergillosis after nivolumab treatment; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of p-IPA complicating pembrolizumab immunotherapy. Briefly, in this new setting of biological/targeted drugs, waiting for growing clinical experience, we recommend  a high level of alertness in diagnosing any infectious complications."

Whilst the field is rapidly evolving and the  list of drugs receiving regulatory approval for the treatment of various cancers  is fast growing, the group of PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors is establishing a leading role amongst immunomodulatory agents. PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors act against pathways  involved in adaptive immune suppression resulting in immune checkpoint blockade.  Within the last four years two PD-1 and three PD-L1 inhibitors have been utilized in clinical practice against a variety of malignancies. Focus was initially placed on targeting cancers considered immunogenic such as melanoma, renal and lung cancers but subsequently the application expanded to include amongst others  Hodgkin Lymphoma, urothelial as well as head and neck cancer. This article provides a comprehensive review of the early and late phase trials that led to the regulatory approval of all five PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors in the corresponding cancer types. It presents available data on the combinations of PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors with other therapies (immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy), the toxicity profile of the PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors and ongoing trials testing the efficacy of these agents in cancer types beyond those that have been addressed already.

However, the underlying synergistic mechanisms remain uncertain.  The blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) can reflect the number of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells and  tumor-associated neutrophils. The immunosuppressive status of the tumor microenvironment could be monitored by the time-series patterns of NLR and ANC. The dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab treatment were retrospectively explored in 15 patients: 8 patients receiving subsequent salvage chemotherapy (2  groups: 3 non-responders and 5 responders), and 7 responders to nivolumab alone (2 groups: 4 partial response and 3 complete response). The dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab differed among these four groups (NLR P = 0.045, ANC P = 0.067). NLR and ANC during nivolumab treatment increased over time in non-responders to salvage chemotherapy, with an inverse relationship between drug response and NLR or ANC at four to six weeks among the four groups. We hypothesize that the early dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab may be associated with the late efficacy of subsequent salvage chemotherapy. Further studies involving a large cohort are needed to confirm these findings, which could provide insight into the role of myeloid immunosuppressor cells in combination PD-1 blockade and chemotherapy."

However, most of the current antiangiogenic agents cannot discriminate tumor angiogenesis from physiological angiogenesis. The aim of this  study was to investigate whether a photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent that targets  CD276, a receptor overexpressed in various tumor cells and tumor vasculature but  with limited expression in normal tissue vasculature, could improve the tumor inhibitory efficacy of a PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. A CD276-targeting agent (IRD-αCD276/Fab) was synthesized by conjugating the Fab fragment of an anti-CD276 antibody with a photosensitizer IRDye700. The in vivo tumor-targeting efficacy and therapeutic effects of IRD-αCD276/Fab with or without an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade were tested in subcutaneous and lung metastatic tumor models. PDT using  IRD-αCD276/Fab significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous 4T1 tumor and  inhibited its lung metastasis. Moreover, it triggered in vivo antitumor immunity  by increasing the activation and maturation of dendritic cells. Tumor PD-L1 levels were also markedly increased after PDT using IRD-αCD276/Fab, as evidenced  by noninvasive PD-L1-targeted small-animal PET imaging. In combination with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, IRD-αCD276/Fab PDT markedly suppressed the growth of tumors and prevented their metastasis to the lung by recruiting the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Our data provide evidence for the role of CD276-targeted PDT for local immune modulation, and its combination with PD-L1/PD-1 axis inhibition is a promising strategy for eliminating primary tumors as well as disseminated metastases, by generating local and systemic antitumor responses."

Tricky balance between effects on tumor cells and immune cells.","Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli. It has been reported to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon, skin, lung, gastric or bladder cancer. SFN is supposed to act primarily as an antioxidant due to the activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway. This enhances the activity of phase II detoxifying enzymes and the trapping of free radicals. Finally, SFN induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis of tumor cells. Here, we discuss effects of SFN on the immune defense system. In contrast to the situation in tumor cells, SFN acts pro-oxidatively in primary human T cells. It increases intracellular ROS levels and decreases GSH, resulting in inhibition of T cell activation and T cell effector functions. Regarding the use of SFN as an anticancer agent we conclude that SFN could act as a double-edged sword. On the one hand it reduces carcinogenesis, on the other hand it blocks the T cell-mediated immune response,  the latter being important for immune surveillance of tumors. Thus, SFN could also interfere with the successful application of immunotherapy by immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. CTLA-4 antibodies and PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) or CAR T cells. Therefore, a combination of SFN with T cell-mediated cancer immunotherapies does not seem advisable."

But all that glitters is not gold and there is an increasing number of reports of adverse effects while using immune-checkpoint inhibitors. While chemotherapy could weaken the immune system, this novel immunotherapy could hyper-activate it, resulting in a unique and distinct spectrum of adverse events, called immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). IRAEs, ranging from mild to potentially life-threatening events, can involve many systems, and their management is radically different from that of cytotoxic drugs: immunosuppressive treatments, such as corticoids, infliximab or mycophenolate mofetil, usually result in complete reversibility, but failing to do so can lead to severe toxicity or even death. Patient selection is an indirect way to reduce adverse events minimizing the number of subjects exposed to this drugs: unfortunately PDL-1, the actual predictive biomarker, would not allow clinicians select or exclude patients for treatment with checkpoint inhibitors."

PFS and OS most strongly influenced physicians' recommendations when considering young female patients who did not want children or young male patients. Infertility was more important to physicians' treatment decision than PFS when considering young women with unknown fertility preferences, whereas hospitalisations due to adverse events played the largest role in treatment decisions for older patients."

Given that the recognition by T cells of tumor antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules is essential for an antitumor immune response, we examined the  effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on MHC-I expression in NSCLC cell lines. Appropriate EGFR-TKIs increased MHC-I expression at the mRNA and cell surface protein levels in NSCLC cells positive for EGFR mutations including those with the T790M secondary mutation. Trametinib, an inhibitor of the extracellular  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase MEK, also increased MHC-I expression, whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor buparlisib did not, suggesting that the MEK-ERK pathway mediates the down-regulation of MHC-I expression in response to EGFR activation. Immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR-mutated NSCLC specimens obtained before and after EGFR-TKI treatment also revealed down-regulation of phosphorylated forms of EGFR and ERK in association with up-regulation of MHC-I, an increased number of infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and increased PD-1 ligand 1 expression after such treatment. Our results thus suggest that mutational activation of EGFR inhibits MHC-I expression through the  MEK-ERK pathway in NSCLC and thereby contributes to the poor response of such tumors to immunotherapy. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the relation between EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling in and the immune response to EGFR-mutated NSCLC. ."

Targeted therapies based  on molecular tumor features and programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) blockade immunotherapy have offered new therapeutic options for  patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-pathway promotes tumor growth and progression, including angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and inhibition of apoptosis, providing a strong rationale for targeting this pathway. EGFR expression is detected in up to 85% of NSCLC and has been demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis. Two approaches for blocking EGFR signaling are available: prevention of ligand binding to the extracellular domain with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase  activity with small molecules. There is a strong rationale to consider the tumor's level of EGFR expression as one of the most significant predictive biomarkers in this setting. In this paper we provide an update focusing on the current status of EGFR-directed mAbs use for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC, through a review of all clinical trials involving anti-EGFR mAbs  in combination with chemotherapy (CT) for advanced disease and with chemo-radiotherapy for stage III disease. Here we also discuss the current status of predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR mAbs when added to first-line CT in patients with advanced NSCLC. Finally, we focused on the relevance of EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)+ and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-Score ≥ 200 as predictive biomarkers for the selection of patients who would be most likely to derive a clinical benefit from treatment with CT in combination with anti-EGFR mAbs, with particular reference also to histology."

However, there were some differences in efficacy and response predictors for anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)  antibodies between squamous (SQ) and nonsquamous (non-SQ) NSCLC. The study aims to elucidate the possible difference in immune microenvironment between SQ-NSCLC  and non-SQ-NSCLC and their influence on the prognosis. A total of 197 patients with stages I to III NSCLC were included. cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression were examined in cancer nest and stroma on 85 SQ-NSCLC and 112 non-SQ-NSCLC samples using immunohistochemistry. More CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were detected in the cancer nests (cCD8) from patients with SQ-NSCLC than those with non-SQ-NSCLC (56% vs. 34%; P = .002). There were no significant differences between the SQ and non-SQ groups in terms of other TIL markers or PD-L1 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that the degree of cCD8+ TIL infiltration was an independent positive predictor for overall survival (OS) in the SQ-NSCLC group (P = .003) and in the non-SQ-NSCLC group (P = .024). In the univariate analysis, CD8+ TILs in the stroma, CD4+ TILs in the cancer nest and stroma, and FOXP3+ TILs in the cancer stroma associated with different prognoses for patients with either non-SQ-NSCLC or SQ-NSCLC. Using a 10% cutoff, PD-L1 expression was a poor prognostic factor in total NSCLC (P = .011), stage I (P = .037), SQ-NSCLC (P = .097), and non-SQ-NSCLC (P = .051). CONCLUSION: The different cCD8+ TIL profile and different prognostic value with certain TILs indicates that SQ-NSCLC and non-SQ-NSCLC are likely different cancer types with respect to their immune microenvironments."

We evaluated the correlation between immune-related adverse events (irAE) and treatment interruption due to irAE on clinical efficacy of PD-1 Ab in advanced NSCLC. Advanced NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 Ab between June 2015 to November 2017 at BC Cancer were identified. Demographic, tumor, treatment details, and frequency and grade (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) of irAE were abstracted from chart review. Kaplan-Meier curves of OS from initiation of PD-1 Ab were generated. Multivariable analysis with 6- and 12-week landmark analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazard regression models. In a cohort of 271 patients, irAEs were observed in 116 patients (42.8%). Nivolumab recipients developing colitis had lower OS compared to those who did not at the 6-week landmark (P = .010) and 12-week landmark (P = .072). For the entire cohort, 56 patients (20.7%) needed treatment interruption because  of an irAE. Treatment interruption correlated with lower OS at the 6-week landmark (P = .005) and 12-week landmark (P = .008). Six-week landmark multivariable analysis identified Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 3 or higher, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 2 or higher, presence of liver metastases, and irAE greater than grade 2 versus no irAE to be  associated with decreased OS (each P < .05). CONCLUSION: Treatment interruption due to irAE was associated with a lower median OS compared to continuous PD-1 Ab therapy. Shorter OS seen with severe irAE might reflect the need for improved physician education in irAE treatment algorithms."

A retrospective review of real-world clinical practice was conducted of all the patients with NSCLC receiving anti-PD-1 therapy at our institution between 2013 and 2016. All patients without adequate clinical or radiologic follow-up data in the electronic medical records were excluded. Imaging examinations for all patients deemed by their thoracic oncologists to have radiologic pseudoprogression or therapy-associated pneumonitis were reviewed by experienced thoracic radiologists. A total of 166 patients with NSCLC had available clinical and imaging data for retrospective review. Of these patients, 4 (2%) were considered to have  radiologic pseudoprogression, 3 of which manifested as increased tumor size and 1 of which manifested with new lesions. A total of 5 patients (3%) were clinically  deemed to have pneumonitis attributable to anti-PD-1 therapy, 4 of which had radiologic manifestations on computed tomography. CONCLUSION: Radiologic pseudoprogression and drug-induced pneumonitis are uncommon but important manifestations of anti-PD-1 therapy on thoracic imaging."

Potential risk factors are analyzed, and strategies for IRAE management are proposed. Forty consecutive patients treated with nivolumab for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were studied, paying particular attention to development of endocrine IRAEs (thyroid, hypophyseal, adrenal, or pancreatic) and clinical outcome. Thyroid function changes were found in 9 patients (22.5%), of which six  developed hypothyroidism and three had hyperthyroidism after a median of 3.8 and  2.3 cycles of nivolumab respectively. Only one patient had thyroid-related symptoms. Thyroid autoimmunity was negative in all cases. Hyperthyroid patients showed no uptake in iodine scintigraphy, and their hormone values returned to normal in less than six months. Nivolumab was discontinued for toxicity in one patient. One patient with hyperthyroidism also developed autoimmune diabetes, and one patient with hypothyroidism also had hypogonadism. After a median follow-up of 7.6 months, 25 patients (62.5%) showed response to nivolumab. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no differences between patients who developed thyroid changes and those who did not. Thyroid changes after treatment with nivolumab are common and warrant active laboratory monitoring. The underlying mechanisms and their relevance deserve further research."

Of these patients, 59 (58%) developed one or more irAEs, among which pruritus (n = 32 (54%)) and rash (n = 24 (41%)) had the highest rates. We did not find evidence for a single HLA gene being associated with all irAEs (all P > .05).

Nab-paclitaxel was developed to reduce the toxicities associated with solvent-bound paclitaxel (sb-paclitaxel). Areas covered: This review first focuses on the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of nab-paclitaxel in NSCLC at different settings. The approval of nab-paclitaxel in  combination with carboplatin at the front-line setting for advanced NSCLC was based on the key phase III study, which showed that nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin was associated with superior overall response rate and favorable toxicity profile compared to sb-paclitaxel/carboplatin. The review also addresses the nab-paclitaxel pharmacology, other combinations (e.g. immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), potential biomarkers (e.g. caveolin-1), and special subgroups (e.g. the elderly, squamous histology). Expert opinion: Existing data has established the role of nab-paclitaxel in the management of advanced NSCLC. Emerging evidence, such as preliminary results from Keynote-407 and IMpower 131 studies, indicates that novel combinations of nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors could further improve clinical benefits with manageable toxicity. Nevertheless, in order to better position nab-paclitaxel and to improve patient selection, future studies are warranted to further understand its mechanism of action, predictive biomarkers, and potential synergism with other agents."

Using dynamic fluorescence imaging to study the dynamic of T cells in tumors from patients with lung cancer, we have recently demonstrated that macrophages trap the T lymphocytes, which are not longer able to contact the tumor cells. In murine models of breast cancer, we could show that the depletion of macrophages allows T cells to interact with tumor cells, a process which enhances anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings illustrate the relevance of current clinical trials combining a strategy that deplete or modulate macrophages with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy."

It is unknown whether palliative RT leads to lymphopenia in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and whether this affects outcomes. As such, we sought to assess the impact of palliative RT on circulating lymphocyte count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio  in patients being treated with PD-1-directed ICI and associations with survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified patients from 5 radiation oncology centers,  treated with palliative RT and either pembrolizumab or nivolumab with non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Patients who received intervening cytotoxic chemotherapy were excluded. We recorded absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio before and after palliative RT and at the start of ICI. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. One hundred ten patients received 225 courses of palliative RT. Median change in ALC after RT was -161 cells/mL. Decreases in ALC were greater with RT to the spine, lung/mediastinum, and chest wall compared with the brain, extremity, or abdomen/pelvis (P = .002) and after courses >5 fractions (P = .003). Extracranial and >5-fraction RT was associated with increased odds of severe lymphopenia (ALC <500) at the end of RT (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; P = .001; and OR, 3.9; P = .001, respectively). Patients who developed RT-induced severe lymphopenia were more likely to have severe lymphopenia when ICI was initiated (OR, 6.4; P = .0001), particularly when RT was administered in the previous 3 months (OR, 189; P < .0001). Severe lymphopenia at onset of ICI therapy was associated with increased mortality on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.1; P = .03). Extracranial or prolonged courses of RT increase the risk of severe  lymphopenia, which is associated with poorer survival in patients treated with ICI."

This work aimed to determine the predictive ability of FUT4 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) after curative resection, as well as to explore the role of a possible FUT4 molecular mechanism on LUAD malignant behavior. A total of 273 LUAD patients after curative resection with complete clinicopathological and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort were collected. Correlation of FUT4 with overall survival (OS) was analyzed based on TCGA and further validated by online Kaplan-Meier Plotter database and IHC in 70 LUAD patients recruited in the First Hospital of China Medical University cohort. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and 1000 bootstrapping were performed to verify the predictive value of FUT4. Gene set enrichment assay (GSEA) was performed to investigate the biological characteristics. Correlation between PD-1 and FUT4 was analyzed based on TCGA cohort and validated by IHC on cohort from our hospital. Increased FUT4 expression led to reduced overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients based on TCGA (p = 0.006 and 0.001 for dichotomous and trichotomous modeling, respectively) and externally validated in KMPLOTTER (p = 0.01) and by IHC based on cohort from our hospital (p = 0.005 and p = 0.019 for dichotomous and trichotomous modeling, respectively). FUT4 overexpression was an independent  high risk factor for OS along with advanced pT stage and pTNM stage (p = 0.001, p = 0.037, and p < 0.001, respectively). GSEA revealed that FUT4 overexpression might correlate with shortened survival of LUAD patients by promoting cell proliferation via ERBB signaling, and suppressing immune response-related pathways. FUT4 expression positively correlated with PD-1 in TCGA (p = 0.026) and validated by IHC on cohort from our hospital (p = 0.029). Increased FUT4 expression led to reduced OS in operable LUAD. FUT4 showed significant correlation with immune response and PD-1 expression."

Although CTLA4 expression was found in multiple tumours including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cells, its function in tumour cells is unknown. Recently, PD-1 was found to be expressed in melanoma cells and to promote tumorigenesis. We found that CTLA4 was expressed in a subset of NSCLC cell lines and in a subgroup  of cancer cells within the lung cancer tissues. We further found that in NSCLC cells, anti-CTLA4 antibody can induce PD-L1 expression, which is mediated by CTLA4 and the EGFR pathway involving phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. In CTLA4 knockout cells, EGFR knockout cells or in the presence of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, anti-CTLA4 antibody was not able to induce PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. Moreover, anti-CTLA4 antibody promoted NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo in the absence of adaptive immunity. These results suggest that tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4 can regulate PD-L1 expression and cell proliferation, and that anti-CTLA4 antibody, by binding to the tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4, may result in the activation of the EGFR pathway in cancer  cells."

We suggest that anti-PD-1 agents not only induce the development of pulmonary TB, but also development of PR after anti-MTB treatment, through upregulation of the immune response. Furthermore, based on their radiological and immunological similarity, we speculate that the schema of development of PR closely resembles that of pseudoprogression in non-small cell lung cancer patients after anti-PD-1 treatment."

PD-L1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry was evaluated by using the Dako PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx kit on the Dako Link 48 auto-stainer (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated  on the basis of data from targeted genome sequencing. The T-effector and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene signature was determined from Affymetrix gene chip  data (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) from frozen specimens. The prevalence of PD-L1 expression was 9.8% at a tumor proportion score  cutoff of at least 50%. PD-L1 mRNA and programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 mRNA positively correlated with PD-L1 protein expression on tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 protein expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells was correlated with the T-effector and IFN-γ gene signature (p < 0.001), but not with TMB. For TCs, all of these biomarkers were independent of each other and neither PD-L1 protein expression, TMB, or T-effector and IFN-γ gene signatures were independently prognostic for patient outcomes. Evaluation of PD-L1 expression, TMB, and T-effector and IFN-γ gene signatures in the cohort with early-stage SqCLC found them to be independent of each other, and none was associated with overall survival. Our results also support the hypothesis that PD-L1 expression is regulated by an intrinsic mechanism on TCs and an adaptive mechanism on immune cells."

Systemic therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy should be provided to patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Applications of targeted therapy, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase  (ALK) inhibitors, in patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement has enabled dramatic improvements in efficacy and tolerability. Despite advances in research and a better understanding of the molecular pathways of NSCLC, few effective therapeutic options are available for most patients with  NSCLC without druggable targets, especially for patients with squamous cell NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 or anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have demonstrated durable response rates across a broad range of solid tumors, including NSCLC, which has revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors. Here, we review the current status and future approaches of immune checkpoint inhibitors that are being investigated for NSCLC with a focus on pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab."

These adverse events can involve all organs, including the haemopoietic system. Thus far, haematological irAEs (haem-irAEs) have not been extensively characterised. This study aims to provide  a comprehensive report of the haem-irAEs induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. In this descriptive observational study, we included consecutive patients aged at least 18 years with grade 2 or worse haem-irAEs induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy registered in three French pharmacovigilance databases: the Registre des Effets Indésirables Sévères des Anticorps Monoclonaux Immunomodulateurs en Cancérologie (REISAMIC; a prospective  registry of patients treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 at a single centre), the ImmunoTOX committee of Gustave Roussy (a national referral database of suspected irAEs in patients treated with immunotherapy), and the registry of the  Centre de Référence des Cytopénies Auto-Immunes de l'Adulte (CeReCAI; a national  database of autoimmune cytopenias). Cases were reviewed by a central committee; adverse events had to be classed as certainly or probably related to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, and their severity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). The primary endpoint was  clinical description of haem-irAEs, as reported in all databases, and their frequency, as reported in the prospective REISAMIC registry. FINDINGS: We screened 948 patients registered in the three databases from June 27, 2014, to June 29, 2018 (745 from REISAMIC, 190 from the ImmunoTOX committee,  and 13 from CeReCAI). 35 patients (21 men and 14 women) with haem-irAEs related to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 were included in the study. Of 745 patients in the REISAMIC registry treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, four had haem-irAEs, giving a frequency of 0·5%. Median age in the 35 patients was 65 years (IQR 51-75), and the most common tumour types were melanoma (15 [43%] patients), non-small-cell lung cancer (12 [34%] patients), and lymphoma (four [11%] patients). 20 (57%) patients received nivolumab, 14 (40%) received pembrolizumab, and one (3%) received atezolizumab. Among the 35 patients, neutropenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and immune thrombocytopenia were the most common types of haem-irAE (each in nine patients [26%]), followed by pancytopenia or aplastic anaemia (five patients [14%]), bicytopenia (one patients with thrombocytopenia plus anaemia and one patient with neutropenia plus anaemia [6%]), and pure red cell aplasia (one patient [3%]). The maximum grade of severity was grade 2 in three (9%) patients, grade 3 in five (14%) patients, and  grade 4 in 25 (71%) patients; two (6%) patients died from febrile neutropenia during haem-irAE related to anti-PD-1. Haem-irAEs resolved in 21 (60%) of the 35  patients. INTERPRETATION: Haem-irAEs induced by PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors are rare but potentially life-threatening events. The most common clinical presentations are neutropenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anaemia. Investigations into earlier detection and better management are warranted. FUNDING: Gustave Roussy and Gustave Roussy Immunotherapy Program."

Epub 2018 Nov 23.","Impact of cytotoxic chemotherapy on PD-L1 expression in patients with non-small cell lung cancer negative for EGFR mutation and ALK fusion.","Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are now an established therapeutic option for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has remained unclear, however, whether cytotoxic chemotherapy affects the immune microenvironment in NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK. We retrospectively evaluated changes in programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density in NSCLC patients who underwent rebiopsy at the site of recurrence after postoperative platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, or in those who underwent rebiopsy after one or more chemotherapeutic regimens at the advanced stage. The PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) and CD8+ TIL density were determined by immunohistochemistry. TMB was estimated by next-generation sequencing with a cancer gene panel (409 genes). Seventeen patients with NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK were enrolled.  Although PD-L1 TPS tended to be increased in rebiopsy samples compared with initial biopsy tissue, this difference was not significant (P =  0.113). Seven patients showed an increase in PD-L1 TPS, with this change being pronounced in four. Two cases in which PD-L1 TPS increased from 0 to 90% or from 0 to 95% after cytotoxic chemotherapy also showed a durable response to subsequent treatment with an ICI. No substantial correlation between PD-L1 TPS and TMB was apparent either before (R = 0.112) or after (R = 0.101) chemotherapy. A moderate correlation was detected between PD-L1 TPS and CD8+ TIL density before chemotherapy (R = 0.517) and a negligible correlation after (R = 0.0219). CONCLUSION: Cytotoxic chemotherapy may change the biological characteristics of tumors including PD-L1 expression level and TMB."

Flow Cytometry of peripheral blood (PB) CD3+, CD8+, CD4+, NK, Treg and MDSCs was prospectively performed in 31 consecutive advanced NSCLC patients at baseline (T0) and after 2 (T1) and 4 (T2) cycles of bi-weekly nivolumab. Functional molecules (PD-1, CD3ζ, Granzyme B, Perforin), cell proliferation (Ki67) and NK receptors (NKG2 A, NKG2D, NKp30) were also explored. The immunohistochemical evaluation of PD-L1 and TILs was restricted to available tumor biopsies. Tissue and circulating parameters were correlated to clinico-pathological features and treatment outcomes. KRAS mutations, active smoking, COPD and steroid treatment conditioned a different distribution of circulating phenotypes. At baseline, clinical benefit (CB, n = 19) group displayed higher number of phenotypically active NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells (p < 0.01) compared to non-responders (NR, n = 12). Prolonged survival outcomes (p < 0.01) were recorded in cases with high baseline circulating NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells. At tissue level, low PD-1 expression in CD8 + TILs was a positive prognostic feature (p < 0.001). Strikingly, high circulating NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells combined with low PD-1/CD8+ ratio in TILs characterized a privileged context able to provide a significantly prolonged (p < 0.01) progression-free survival (PFS). During PD-1 blockade, NKs progressively raised in CB while declined in NR (p < 0.05) and this phenomenon was counterbalanced by parallel changes in Treg. CONCLUSION: The functional pool of circulating NKs associated with a divergent PD-1 expression in blood and tissue CD8+ lymphocytes portrays an immune profile predictive of anti-PD1 treatment efficacy."

In this era of cancer immunotherapy, humanized mouse models which recapitulate human immune system, are needed for predicting immunotherapy response in patients. We established a Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which can be used as a preclinical testing platform for assessing efficacy of different immunotherapeutic agents. Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model was established by engrafting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into NOD/scid/IL-2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice. Cytokine array was performed to assess serological similarity between patient and the Hu-PBL-NSG mouse, and microscopic immune cell infiltration was observed in various organs mouse model. Human anti-PD-1 therapy was treated for assessing drug efficacy in patient-derived tumor. hCD3+hCD45+ T-cells and antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and MDSC) increased in the serum of Hu-PBL-NSG mouse 24 h after the  transfusion of human PBMCs, and CD3 + T cells were observed in lung, liver, kidney, spleen sections. Cytokine arrays of human and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse revealed high similarity of Th1, Th2, Th17-related cytokines. A tumor xenograft was engrafted from an EML4-ALK patient, and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse was sacrificed for histological analyses. hCD3+ T cells were infiltrated within the tumor, and CD11c + cells, which represent antigen-presenting capability, were seen in spleen, lung, liver and kidney. When anti-PD-1 Ab was treated intraperitoneally,  xenograft tumor showed significant reduction in volume after day 6, and increased expression of immune response-related genes on microarray analysis in the tumor.  Mostly IFN-gamma and its related gene sets were significantly changed (FDR < 0.25, GSEA). CONCLUSION: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which highly resembles human immune system was successfully established. This model could be a strong preclinical model for testing efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents, and also for pursuing novel immunotherapy treatment strategies in advanced NSCLC."

The identification of subclonal mutations using deep sequencing to evaluate the degree of molecular heterogeneity may improve IIIA-N2 classification. The aim of this prospective study was to assess mutational and immunohistochemical characteristics in primary tumours and  involved lymph nodes (LN) in operated patients. Four patients operated for primary lung carcinoma and unisite N2 mediastinal involvement were consecutively  selected. Samples (tumour and paired LN) were analysed for PD1, PD-L1 and CD8 immunostaining. Somatic mutation testing was performed by deep targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), with the AmpliSeq™ Colon and Lung Cancer Panel (LifeTechnology). A total of 9 primary lung cancer samples and 10 LN stations were analysed. For each cancer, we found 2 mutations, with allelic ratios from 3% to 72%. Mutational patterns were heterogeneous for 2 primary tumours. In 3 cases, mutations observed in the primary tumour were not found in LN metastases (ALK, FGFR3, MET). Inversely, in 1 case, a KRAS mutation was found in LN but not in the primary tumour. All primary tumours were found PD-L1 positive while CD8+ T cells  infiltrate varied. In the different examined LN samples, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ and PD1+ T cells infiltrate were not similar to the primary tumour. This preliminary prospective study shows the diversity of intra-tumour and LN mutations using routinely-used targeted NGS, concerning both mutated gene and allelic ratio. Further studies are needed to evaluate its prognostic impact."

However, immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-PD-1, have not been assessed in patients with subclinical disease with advanced NSCLC, and no useful clinical biomarkers have been associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) among  these patients treated with anti-PD-1. Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with subclinical disease with advanced NSCLC and with or without preexisting autoimmune markers, including rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antithyroglobulin, and antithyroid peroxidase; and to assess potential clinical biomarkers that may be meaningfully and conveniently associated with clinical benefit or with irAEs following anti-PD-1 treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: This medical records analysis retrospectively  evaluated 137 patients who received nivolumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy at Sendai Kousei Hospital in Japan between January 2016 and January 2018. Treatment  efficacy and irAEs were evaluated along with candidate factors that may be associated with irAEs. Exposures: Absence or presence of specific autoimmune markers and antibodies before treatment. Preexisting antibodies and autoimmune markers, progression-free survival (PFS), and irAEs. Results: Of 137 patients with advanced NSCLC, 105 were men, the median age was 68 (range, 36-88) years, 99 underwent nivolumab monotherapy, 38 underwent pembrolizumab monotherapy, and 134 had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. The median PFS was 6.5 (95% CI, 4.4-12.9) months among patients with examined preexisting antibodies and 3.5 (95% CI, 2.4-4.1) months among patients without, suggesting significantly better prognosis in the former. The hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the presence of the  examined preexisting antibodies was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.36-0.79; P = .002). The PFS was significantly longer among patients with any preexisting antibodies than among those without. The examined preexisting antibodies (48 patients [73%]) and  rheumatoid factor (26 patients [39%]) were more common among patients who developed irAEs. Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of the examined preexisting antibodies was independently associated with irAEs (odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.59-6.65; P = .001). Skin reactions were more frequent among patients with preexisting rheumatoid factor (47% vs 24%, P = .02), whereas  thyroid dysfunction was more frequent among patients with preexisting antithyroid antibodies (20% vs 1%, P < .001). The presence of the examined preexisting antibodies was associated with clinical benefit and with the development of irAEs in patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Thus, the presence of these autoimmune markers may help determine the risk-benefit ratio for individual patients with NSCLC, maximizing therapeutic benefits while minimizing  irAEs."

Our current study compared the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) between paired cytological and surgical samples. Materials and Methods: Formalin-fixed lung cancer tissue microarray and paired cell blocks and surgical specimens from the same patients with a confirmed diagnosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, n = 29) and adenocarcinoma (AC, n = 23) were sectioned for PD-L1 IHC. Results: PD-L1 was expressed on tumor cells in 16 of 29 (55%) SCC surgical specimens and 18 of 29 (62%) paired cytologic specimens with 83% matched immunostains. PD-L1 was expressed on tumor cells in 13 of 23 (57%) AC surgical specimens and in 17 of 23 (74%) paired cytologic specimens with 79% matched immunostains. The PD-L1 was expressed on inflammatory cells in 20 of 23 (87%) AC  surgical specimens and in 15 of 23 (65%) paired cytologic specimens with 70% matched immunostains.

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials that compared PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy in first line of treatment for advanced NSCLC. The outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and treatment-related adverse events (AEs). A fixed-effect or random-effects model was adopted depending on between-study heterogeneity. Six trials involving 3144 patients were included. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy was significantly associated with improvement of PFS (hazards ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% CI 0.57-0.67; P < .001), OS (HR, 0.68; 95% CI 0.53-0.87; P = .002) and ORR (relative ratio [RR], 1.56; 95% CI 1.29-1.89; P < .001), irrespective of PD-L1 expression level. The significant predictor(s) for treatment benefit with combination therapy versus chemotherapy alone were PD-L1 expression level for PFS (P < .001); types of checkpoint inhibitor for ORR (P < .001); histology (P = .025), age (P = .038), gender (P < .001), and types of checkpoint inhibitor (P < .001) for OS. In safety analyses, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor  plus chemotherapy had significantly higher incidence of adverse events (AEs) of grade 3 or higher (RR, 1.14; P = .007), AEs leading to treatment discontinuation  (RR, 1.29; P = .022), serious AEs (RR 1.70; P = .006), immune mediated AEs of any grade (RR, 2.37; P < .001), and immune mediated AEs of grade 3 or higher (RR, 3.71; P < .001).

In this context, immunotherapy is thought to have revolutionized the standard of care for cancer patients in the long term. For example, immunotherapy approaches such as immune checkpoint blockade are currently increasingly being used in cancer treatment, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and  there is hope from the first clinical trials that the appropriate integration of  immunotherapy into standard care will raise the success rates of cancer therapy to a new level. Nevertheless, successful cancer therapy remains a major challenge, particularly in tumors with either pronounced resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatment, a high risk of normal tissue complications, or both, as in lung cancer. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy have the capacity to evoke adverse effects in normal tissues when administered alone. However, therapy concepts are usually highly complex, and it is still not clear if combining immunotherapy with radio(chemo)therapy will increase the risk of normal tissue complications, in particular since normal tissue toxicity induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy can involve immunologic processes. Unfortunately, no reliable biomarkers are available so far that are suited to predict the unique normal tissue sensitivity of a given patient to a given treatment. Consequently, clinical trials combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy are attracting major attention, not only regarding efficacy, but also with regard to safety. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge of radiation-induced and immunotherapy-induced effects in tumor and normal tissue of the lung, and discuss the potential limitations of combined radio-immunotherapy in lung cancer with a focus on the suspected risk for enhanced acute and chronic  normal tissue toxicity."

Moreover, dLGG-20 and CP-2 treatment prolonged mouse mean survival time. dLGG-20 treatment significantly inhibited the expression levels of several  molecular markers, that is, PCNA, MMP2, COX-2, VEGF, vimentin, snail, TGF-β, β-catenin, TNF-α, PD-1 and PD-L1 in mouse lung tissues compared to tumor control  mice. Significant inhibition of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and promotion of CD8 + Tc cell recruitment in the lung microenvironment was observed  in dLGG-20-treated mice. A LC/MS-based comparative oxylipin metabolomics study showed that dLGG-20 treatment significantly induced (5.0- to 12.8-fold) the 12/15-LOX catalyzed oxylipin products in mouse serum including 17-HDHA from DHA,  15-HEPE from EPA, 8- and 12-HETEs from AA, and CYP450-derived 20-HETE from AA. CP-2 treatment increased 12/15-LOX derived 8-, 11- and 12-HETEs from AA, and CYP450 derived 11,12-EET from AA ad 9,10-DHOME from LA by 5.3- to 8.1-fold. Of note, dLGG and 17-HDHA were more effective than CP in preventing B16 melanoma cell-induced pulmonary vascular permeability in mice through inhibition of TNF-α  production, up-regulation of tight junction proteins claudin1 and ZO-2 and deregulation of Src activation.

However, all of the evidence regarding this effect to date comes from work with PD1/PDL1 inhibitors. Here we explored whether this effect also occurs with other forms of immune therapy, specifically interleukin-2 (IL-2). We retrospectively assessed outcomes in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) who had previously received radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) within 18 months before the intrapleural infusion of IL-2 or cisplatin. Radiotherapy sites included lungs, thoracic lymph nodes, and intracranial. All patients received intrapleural infusion of IL-2 or cisplatin, and most had had several cycles of standard chemotherapy for NSCLC. We identified 3,747 patients with MPE (median age 64 years [range 29-88)) treated at one of several institutions from August 2009 through February 2015; 642 patients had been treated with IL-2 and 1102 with cisplatin and had survived for at least 6 months  afterward. Among those who received IL-2, 288 had no radiotherapy, 324 had extracranial (i.e., thoracic) radiotherapy, and 36 had intracranial radiotherapy. The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 38 months. Patients who had  received extracranial radiotherapy followed by IL-2 had significantly longer PFS  than patients who had not received extracranial radiotherapy (i.e., either no radiotherapy or intracranial radiotherapy). Patients who had received intracranial or extracranial radiotherapy followed by IL-2 had significantly longer OS than did other patients. No survival advantage was noted for prior radiotherapy among patients who received intrapleural cisplatin. We speculate that previous radiotherapy could enhance the efficacy of subsequent intrapleural  infusion of IL-2, a radio-memory effect that could be beneficial in future studies."

But they are also associated with distinctive set of toxic effects, which are recognized as immune-related adverse events. Among those immune-related adverse events, pneumonitis is rare, but it is often clinically serious and potentially life-threatening. Although many clinical trial results of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had been reported incidence of pneumonitis, the knowledge based on the individual cohort data from each clinical trial is limited. So we conducted a meta-analysis of trials of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with advanced cancer and compared relative risk and incidence among different tumor types and therapeutic regimens. Such an analysis may provide important knowledge  of this rare but clinically significant and potentially serious immune-related adverse event. Methods: Electronic databases were used to search eligible literatures, include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing immune checkpoint inhibitors vs. standard therapies. All-grade (1-4) or high-grade (3-4) pneumonitis events were extracted. The summary relative risk, summary incidence,  and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: The incidence of all-grade and high-grade pneumonitis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was significantly higher compared with other tumor types, such as Melanoma, urothelial carcinoma (UC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (3.1% vs. 2.0%; p = 0.02, 1.4% vs. 0.6%; p = 0.03). The risk of all-grade pneumonitis was obtained from all patients in both experimental arm and control arm. Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 did significantly increase the risk of all-grade and high-grade pneumonitis compared  with controls (fixed effects, RR: 4.70; 95% CI: 2.81-7.85; p < 0.00001, RR: 3.33; 95% CI: 1.68-6.59; p = 0.0006). The incidence of immune checkpoint inhibitors related pneumonitis was higher in NSCLC than other tumor types. Patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor in experiment arms are more likely to experience any grade pneumonitis than control arms. These findings suggest that clinician need to draw more attention on this rare but serious adverse event."

Contributing to the worse prognosis in TNBC is the higher rates of relapse and rapid progression after relapse. Advances in targeted therapeutics and conventional chemotherapy for TNBC have been stymied due to the lack of specific targets. Moreover, the responses to chemotherapy in TNBC lack durability, partially accounting for the higher rates of relapse. Immunotherapy, notably immune-checkpoint blockade, has shown to improve survival and maintain robust antitumor responses in both hematologic and  solid malignancies. Unlike lung cancer, melanoma, and bladder cancer, most breast cancers are not inherently immunogenic and typically have low T cell infiltration. However, among breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is characterized by greater tumor immune infiltrate and higher degree of stromal and intratumoral tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a predictive marker for responses to immunotherapy. Moreover, in TNBC, the high number of stromal TILs is predictive of more favorable survival outcomes and response to chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is being extensively explored in TNBC and clinical trials are showing some promising results. This article focuses on the rationale for immunotherapy in TNBC, to explore and discuss preclinical data, results from early clinical trials, and to summarize some ongoing trials. We will also discuss the potential  application of immunotherapy in TNBC from a clinician's perspective."

The main objective of this study was to determine the molecular profile of CRC with BM. Methods: We included 82 CRC patients with BM. KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and mismatch repair (MMR) status were investigated on primary tumors (n = 82) and BM (n = 38). ALK, ROS1, cMET, HER-2, PD-1, PD-L1, CD3 and CD8 status were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and when recommended, by fluorescence in situ  hybridization. Results: In primary tumors, KRAS, NRAS and BRAF mutations were observed in 56%, 6%, and 6% of cases, respectively. No ROS1, ALK and cMET rearrangement was detected. Only one tumor presented HER-2 amplification. Molecular profiles were mostly concordant between BM and paired primary tumors, except for 9% of discordances for RAS mutation. CD3, CD8, PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions presented some discordance between primary tumors and BM. In multivariate analysis, multiple BM, lung metastases and PD-L1+ tumor were predictive of poor overall survival. CRCs with BM are associated with high frequency of RAS mutations and significant discordance for RAS mutational status between BM and paired primary tumors. Multiple BM, lung metastases and PD-L1+ have been identified as prognostic factors and can guide therapeutic decisions for CRC patients with BM."

PD-L1 interacts with programmed death-1 (PD-1) on T cells to trigger an inhibitory signal that suppresses anti-tumor T cell responses as an important mechanism of tumor escape from anti-tumor immune response. Recent development of PD-1/PD-L1 blockades has provided novel immunotherapy strategies for cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although the therapy is quite effective for some patients with NSCLC, others are resistant to the treatment, so that regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 in  lung cancer cells need to be understood in detail. Here we analyzed effect of interferon-β (IFN-β) that can be produced in cancer microenvironment on PD-L1 expression in lung tumor cells. An addition of IFN-β elevated PD-L1 expression in mouse and human lung cancer cell lines in culture. This phenomenon was totally dependent on JAK signaling molecules, while IRF9 deficiency in murine lung cancer cells partially attenuated the IFN-β-induced increase in PD-L1. mTOR may not be significantly involved in the regulation of PD-L1, whereas PI3-K pathway played differential roles on PD-L1 mRNA and cell-surface PD-L1 expression, in the cells  treated with IFN-β. These results strongly suggest that the type I IFN receptor signal elicits an increase in PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells through IRF9-dependent and independent pathways."

Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key mediator of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, and plays important roles in promoting cancer development, drug resistance and metastasis in human NSCLC and MPM. YAP has been  suggested as a new therapeutic target in NSCLC and MPM. The role of YAP in regulating tumor immunity such as PD-L1 expression has just begun to be explored, and the correlation between YAP-induced tumorigenesis and host anti-tumor immune  responses is not well known. Here, we review recent studies investigating the correlation between YAP and PD-L1 and demonstrating the mechanism by which YAP regulates PD-L1 expression in human NSCLC and MPM.

Combining checkpoint inhibition with cytotoxic chemotherapy may have a synergistic effect and improve  efficacy. We conducted this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who had not previously received treatment. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive carboplatin and etoposide with either atezolizumab or placebo for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a maintenance phase during which they received either atezolizumab or placebo (according to the previous random assignment) until they  had unacceptable toxic effects, disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or no additional clinical benefit. The two primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 201 patients were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group, and 202 patients to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the median overall survival was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab group and 10.3 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.91; P=0.007).

Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a mediator of the PD-1  receptor, plays an inhibitory role in cancer immune responses. PD-L1 upregulation can impede infiltrating T-cell functions in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a lung cancer subtype. However, associations between the expression of PD-L1 and infiltration of B cells (a major immunoregulatory cell) remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of infiltrating B cells in LUAD progression and its correlation with PD-L1 expression. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD data set was used to explore associations among B-cell infiltration, PD-L1 expression, clinical outcome, and gene landscape. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to explore putative signaling pathways and candidate genes. The drug enrichment analysis was used to identify candidate genes and the related drugs. We found that high B-cell infiltration was correlated with better prognoses; however, PD-L1 may interfere with the survival advantage in patients with high B-cell infiltration. The gene landscape was characterized comprehensively, with distinct PD-L1 levels in cell populations with high B-cell infiltration. We obtained five upregulated signaling pathways from the gene landscape: apoptosis,  tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α signaling via nuclear factor (NF)-κB, apical surface, interferon-α response, and KRAS signaling. Moreover, four candidate genes and their related target drugs were also identified, namely interleukin-2β  receptor (IL2RB), IL-2γ receptor (IL2RG), Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8), and TNF. These findings suggest that tumor-infiltrating B cells could act as a clinical factor in anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy for LUAD."

The clinical outcomes were overall survival (OS),  progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and adverse event  (AE). For overall patients, pembrolizumab had significantly superior OS (hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval, 0.67, 0.47-0.94; P = 0.02) and numerically better PFS (HR, 0.79, 0.60-1.04; P = 0.10) than atezolizumab, while they had similar ORR, all cause AE and grade 3-5 AE. For PD-L1 high patients, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab showed similar OS and PFS. However, for PD-L1 low/negative patients, pembrolizumab had superior OS (HR, 0.43, 0.24-0.76; P <  0.01/ HR, 0.74, 0.40-1.38; P = 0.35) and better PFS (HR, 0.80, 0.51-1.26; P = 0.33/ HR, 0.46, 0.28-0.75; P <0.01) than atezolizumab.

Data for HRs, 95% CIs for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs) were extracted and pooled. Results: A total of five randomized controlled trials including 2,910 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled HRs (95% CI) were 0.71 (0.63-0.79, P<0.0001) for OS and 0.86 (0.73-1.02) for PFS. In the subgroup analysis, the pooled HR (95% CI) for PFS was 0.82 (0.75-0.91, P<0.0001) in patients with high PDL1 expression, but no significant difference was seen in patients with low expression (0.97 [0.76-1.24], P=0.82).

Programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitors in metastatic gastroesophageal cancer have demonstrated response rates of approximately 25% in  programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1+) tumors. Unfortunately, the majority of patients do not respond. Therefore, a rationale strategy of combining immunotherapeutic agents with chemoradiation in earlier stage esophageal cancer may prevent metastatic disease in patients. To determine the effects of chemoradiation on resected esophageal adenocarcinomas, we examined the immune microenvironment pre- and post-chemoradiation using immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and functional analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Additionally, to assess the duration and dependency of radiation-induced PD-L1 upregulation, a surgical rat reflux model of esophageal adenocarcinoma is used. First, tumor-bearing animals were dosed with single-fraction 13Gy or 16Gy radiation to determine safety, dose correlation, and PD-L1 upregulation using qRT-PCR post-radiation. Next, longitudinal PD-L1 expression levels within individual animals were determined using serial endoscopic biopsies at baseline, 1, 5, and 9 weeks post 16Gy radiation. The majority of cancers displayed enhanced interferon γ and activated CD8+ T lymphocytes at the tumor stroma interface. These tumors also demonstrated  enhanced upregulation of PD-L1 and multiple other immune checkpoints including TIM3, GITR, IDO1, LAG3, OX40, and KIR. The animal model results indicated PD-L1 upregulation is dose-dependent and transiently elevated post radiation exposure. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the evolving immune landscape after chemoradiation and have significant implications for neoadjuvant trial designs that will combine radiotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors."

Interaction between programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1, plays important roles in tumor immunology. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells have characteristically high PD-1 expression; thus, in the present study, we investigated the role of circulating Tfh cells and their correlation with disease-free survival after tumor resection in NSCLC. We found significantly higher number of Tfh cells but lower serum interleukin (IL)-21 levels in NSCLC patients, especially in those with advanced stage (III and IV), indicating that the function of Tfh cells to produce IL-21 was impaired. Further analysis showed  that the increase in Tfh cells was attributable to an expansion of the PD-1+ -Tfh2 and PD-1+ -Tfh17 subtypes. Functional analysis showed that Tfh cells from NSCLC patients induced the differentiation of regulatory B cells and CD14+ human  leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR- cells. Interestingly, the number of Tfh1 subtypes in  NSCLC patients was negatively correlated with disease-free survival after tumor resection. In short, the high number and abnormal function of Tfh cells could cause further immunosuppression and lead to tumor development in NSCLC. Rescuing  Tfh functions therefore represents a potential therapeutic strategy in NSCLC."

Although patients with high PD-L1 expression have improved outcomes with anti-PD-1/PD-L1-directed therapies, use as a predictive biomarker is complicated  by robust responses in some patients with low-level expression. Furthermore, reported PD-L1 levels in lung cancers vary widely, and discrepancies exist with different antibodies. PD-L1 expression was thus compared by immunohistochemistry  (IHC) versus RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) in 112 lung cancers by tissue microarray: 51 adenocarcinoma, 42 squamous cell carcinoma, 9 adenosquamous carcinoma, 5 carcinoid, 3 undifferentiated large cell carcinoma, 1 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and 1 small cell carcinoma. At least 1% tumor cell staining was considered positive in each modality. A positive concordance of only 60% (67/112) was found between IHC and ISH. Fifty percent (56/112) were positive  by IHC and 50% (56/112) by ISH; however, 20% (22/112) were ISH positive but IHC negative. Conversely, 21% (23/112) were IHC positive but ISH negative. There was  no significant stratification of PD-L1 positivity by histologic subtype. A trend  of more PD-L1-positive stage I cancers identified by ISH versus IHC was observed  but was not statistically significant (50% [27/54] by IHC and 64% [35/55] by ISH, P = .18). No significant difference in survival was identified, with an average of 5.3 months in IHC versus 5.2 months in ISH-positive cases.

However, changes in PD-L1 expression of tumor cells during clinical courses have  not been fully evaluated. We evaluated changes in PD-L1 expression for non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received anticancer treatments during clinical courses. In 76 NSCLC patients, PD-L1 expression was evaluated before and after anticancer treatment by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using an anti-PD-L1 antibody. We defined two cut-off points of PD-L1 expression (1 and 50%) and three corresponding IHC groups (A: 0%, B: 1-49%, and C: ≥50%). IHC group B and C were considered to be positive expression, and we defined the difference of IHC group  between pre- and post-treatment as 'major change' in PD-L1 expression. Before anticancer treatment, PD-L1 expression was observed in 38/76 (50%) patients, and was significantly less common in patients harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) than in those without (P = 0.039). After anticancer treatment, PD-L1 expression was observed in 36/76 (47%) patients. Major increases in PD-L1 expression were seen in 11 (14%), and major decreases in 18 (24%) patients. Among 13 patients harboring EGFR mutations  treated with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), five (38%) showed major increases. CONCLUSION: Major changes of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells were observed in 38% of NSCLC patients who received anticancer treatments. And, treatments with EGFR-TKI may increase PD-L1 expression in NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations."

PD-1 is the major inhibitory receptor regulating T-cell exhaustion, and T-cells with high PD-1 expression lose their ability to eliminate cancer. PD-1 pathway blockade by pembrolizumab reinvigorates exhausted T-cells and restores their antitumor immune responses. However, reinvigorated T-cells also evoke immune-related adverse effects (irAEs), which stem from the restored activity. Currently, the pathogenic mechanisms of irAEs have not been sufficiently determined. We experienced a patient with NSCLC  with high PD-L1 expression and cervical lymph node metastases, who demonstrated a good clinical response to first line pembrolizumab but suffered from a severe cutaneous adverse event. Both of his skin lesions and cervical metastases showed  extensive CD8(+) PD-1(+) T-cell infiltration in immunofluorescence analysis. This finding suggests a possible contribution of reinvigorated CD8(+) PD-1(+) T-cells  in anti-PD-1 therapy-induced skin rash. Intriguingly, CD8(+) T-cells in the skin  rash showed higher Ki-67 expression, a proliferation marker, than those in the cervical lymph node lesion. This is the first report of an association between proliferative CD8(+) PD-1(+) T-cells and irAEs."

Given that the majority of current PD-L1 testing in US clinical practice is performed at commercial reference laboratories, we aimed to evaluate the concordance of the 28-8 and 22C3 assays in a real-world setting. Matched PD-L1 IHC 28-8 and 22C3 results from routine assessment were obtained from 1930 patients, including 412 confirmed to have lung cancer, submitted from hospitals in over 38 US states/territories. Biopsies were stained, reviewed and scored by trained/certified pathologists at a single cancer reference laboratory between 2015 and 2017. Rate of concordance between assay findings was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis; overall per cent agreement (OPA), positive per cent agreement and negative per cent agreement; and Cohen's kappa. PD-L1 IHC 28-8 and 22C3 displayed strong correlation across all samples  and in samples with a confirmed lung cancer diagnosis irrespective of biopsy site. The OPA was 97%-98% for all samples, depending on the expression level defining PD-L1 positivity. In the Bland-Altman analysis, the mean difference in percentage of tumour cells positively stained for PD-L1 between the paired assay  findings was -0.80% for all samples and -0.93% in samples with a confirmed lung cancer diagnosis. These data, in conjunction with recent findings, support the analytical concordance of the PD-L1 IHC 28-8 and 22C3 assays for assessing per cent tumour-cell membrane PD-L1 expression."

T cells play a major role in tumor-associated immune response. This study aimed to investigate PD-L1 expression alone and combined with CD8 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) density in relation to clinicopathologic parameters and survival in NSCLC patients. Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate PD-L1 expression and  CD8 TILs density in 55 NSCLC patients. PD-L1 immunopositivity was detected in 36  (65.5%) of NSCLC cases. PD-L1 expression was significantly related to high tumor  grade (p value = 0.038) and low CD8 TILs density (p value = 0.004), whereas no significant relations were detected between PD-L1 expression and tumor stage (p value = 0.121), overall survival (OS) (p value = 0.428) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p value = 0.439). Among PD-L1/CD8 TILs density groups, PD-L1+/CD8Low group was significantly associated with high tumor grade compared to PD-L1-/CD8high group (pairwise p = 0.016). PD-L1+/CD8Low group was significantly related to advanced tumor stage compared to PD-L1+/CD8high and PD-L1-/CD8Low groups (pairwise p = 0.001 and 0.013 respectively). PD-L1-/CD8high  group exhibited the best OS and PFS whereas PD-L1+/CD8low group had the poorest OS and PFS (p value = 0.032 and 0.001 respectively). Assessment of PD-L1 combined with CD8 TILs density, instead of PD-L1 alone, suggested important prognostic relevance in NSCLC patients."

In C3H mice, 5 × 106 LM8 (osteosarcoma cell line with a high metastatic  potential in the lungs originating from the C3H mouse) cells were transplanted subcutaneously. Thereafter, the mice were divided into 4 groups as follows: the control group received no intervention (CG, n = 5), the surgery group underwent subcutaneous tumor resection (tumor debulking surgery) 11 days after transplantation (SG, n = 10), the immunotherapy group received a cocktail consisting of 200 μg each of three antibodies (anti-Tim-3, anti-PD-L1, and anti-OX-86) intraperitoneally on posttransplantation days 11, 14, 18, and 21 (IG, n = 10), and the combination therapy group, tumor debulking surgery on day 11 and the cocktail intraperitoneally on days 11, 14, 18, and 21 (COMBG, n = 10). Survival curves were plotted by using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with those plotted using the log-rank test. Next, the lungs of mice in the 4 groups were pathologically evaluated. The COMBG showed significantly longer survival than the other three groups (P ≤ 0.002), whereas the SG and IG revealed no difference in survival rate compared to CG. Pathological evaluations revealed no lung metastasis 16 weeks after tumor transplantation in the survivors of COMBG. The results of this study suggest that tumor debulking surgery combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors could be a curative treatment for advanced pediatric solid tumors."

It has been reported that adoptive cell immunotherapy could prolong the overall survival (OS) of advanced cancer patients. The introduction of agents that induce immune checkpoint blockades has improved the efficacy of immune-mediated therapy  for metastatic cancers. However, the effects of combining a checkpoint inhibitor  with CIK cells or NK cells to target non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)remain unknown. Methods: The present study investigated the effects of combining CIK cells with a programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody). During the expansion cultivation, the addition of the PD-1 antibody promoted CIK-mediated cytotoxicity in H1975 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Co-cultivation of CIK cells with the PD-1 antibody for 6 days induced CD3+CD56+ T cell expansion, with increases in the levels of CD107a and interferon γ (IFN-γ). Results: When NK cells were co-cultured with 5 µg/mL of an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) mAb for 24 hours at an effector cell: target ratio of 10:1, it led to more potent cytotoxicity compared to other time points and concentrations. However, combining NK cells with the anti-PD-L1 mAb showed no significant advantages over treatment with NK cells alone. Our results suggest that combining CIK cells with PD-1 blockade before transfusion might improve the efficiency of CIK therapy for NSCLC patients. This effect does not seem to occur for NK cell therapy."

Therefore, our meta-analysis aimed to evaluate  the effectiveness and safety of combination therapy to promote its application. Methods: We searched electronic databases for studies that estimated the safety and efficacy of combined therapy. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control response (DCR) parameters were evaluated with odds ratio (OR) values of the combination arm over the non-combination arm. Hazard ratios (HR) and its 95%  confidence intervals (95% CI) were used to calculate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the combination and non-combination arms. All  treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and 3 to 5 TRAEs were expressed as relative risk (RR) values of the combination arm over the non-combination arm. Results: Ten eligible studies involving 4,887 patients were identified. The pooled ORs for ORR and DCR were 1.85 (95% CI: 1.30-2.63, P<0.01) and 1.14 (95% CI: 0.70-1.86, P<0.01), respectively. The pooled HRs for PFS and OS were 0.67 (95% CI: 0.58-0.79, P<0.001) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.65-0.88, P<0.001), respectively. In subgroup analysis, ORR and DCR were significantly improved in the programmed cell death-1/L1 (PD-1/L1) blockade for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) group (subgroup A), with a combined OR values of 2.36 (95% CI: 1.79-3.13, P<0.001) and  1.92 (95% CI: 1.10-3.35, P<0.001), respectively. However, no significant benefits were observed in the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blockade for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (subgroup B) and CTLA-4 blockade for NSCLC groups (subgroup C). In addition, a significant improvement in PFS was observed in subgroup A, subgroup B and subgroup C, with pooled HR values of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.52-0.63, P<0.001), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76-0.97, P<0.05) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.68-1.00, P<0.05), respectively. Only subgroup A exhibited an OS benefit, with a combined HR value of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.55-0.81, P<0.001). Moreover, as the expression of PD-L1 increased, the PFS and OS benefits were more significantly. Furthermore, patients without central nervous system (CNS) metastasis who were treated with PD-1/L1 inhibitors had a longer OS than patients with CNS metastasis (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0.80, P<0.001). Finally, combined therapy was associated  with 3 to 5 TRAEs (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.47; P<0.01). Patients treated with immunotherapy and chemotherapy in combination  exhibited superior in ORR, DCR, PFS and OS as well as slightly increased TRAE levels compared with those of patients treated with either monotherapy."

Currently, only formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples are acceptable for PD-L1 immunostaining with the anti-PD-L1 antibodies 22-C3 and SP263. We investigated retrospectively the accuracy of the anti PD-L1 antibodies  22-C3, 28-28, SP263 in 50 paired histological samples and cytological smears of NSCLC patients. Results The accuracy of the three antibodies for the detection of PD-L1 in histological samples was higher for the antibody SP263 (AUC/ROC = 1) compared to the clones 28-8 (AUC/ROC =,991) and 22-C3 (AUC/ROC =,942). The overall concordance between histological samples and cytological smears using the SP263 clone was moderate (kappa = 0,364). However when the cyto-histological concordance was calculated using just the <50% vs ≥50% cut-off the agreement (kappa = 0.626) was good. The accuracy of the antibody SP263 in cytological smears was good (AUC/ROC =,921). A fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis on  10 histological cases positive for PD-L1 at immunohistochemistry showed amplification of the CD274 gene only in one case. Immunocytochemical  staining for PD-L1 in diagnostic cytological smears of NSCLC is feasible and applicable at least using the >50% cancer cell cut-off. The three antibodies SP263, 22-C3 and 28-8 are all suitable for the diagnostic detection of PD-L1 on tissue sections with a superiority of the SP263 clone. The implementation of PD-L1 immunocytochemistry on cytological smears will likely expand the pool of NSCLC patients candidate to first-line immunotherapy."

The data regarding its effectiveness and safety in real life setting is lacking. 260 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC treated with  nivolumab at five Israeli cancer centers between January 2015 and March 2016 were evaluated for overall survival (OS) and toxicity. OS was analyzed by the Cox proportional-hazards regression model. Overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed in 49 patients using RECIST, v.1.1. Median age was 67y (41-99); males 68%; smokers 76%; ECOG PS ≥2 46%; non-squamous/squamous/other/NR 70%/23%/6%/1%; brain metastases 21%; liver metastases 21%; treatment line: 1st/2nd/3rd+-line/NR 6%/64%/26%/4%. With median survival follow-up of 18.5 months (range, 12.0-26.9), 155 (60%) patients died; median OS comprised 5.9 months (95% CI 4.7-7.4). In univariate and multivariate analysis, the only variable which significantly correlated with OS was ECOG PS. Median OS of patients with ECOG PS 0/1 and ECOG PS ≥2 comprised 9.5 months (95% CI, 6.7-NR) and 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.6-4.5), respectively. For 49 patients evaluable for response (median follow-up of 8.4 months (range, 2-16.8), ORR was 35%, median PFS was 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.8-7.7), incidence of pseudo-progression was 9%. The nivolumab safety profile was in accordance with the literature data,  except for febrile neutropenia and pericarditis (observed in 1 case each). CONCLUSION: In real life setting, the effectiveness of nivolumab is reasonable yet less prominent than it has been demonstrated in clinical trials. ECOG PS ≥2 is associated with poor prognosis."

However, still many patients do not respond to these agents. After development of resistance to PD-1 blockade, further evaluation of chemotherapy regimen will be necessary. A 57-year old man had cough with minimal whitish expectoration. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed that he had an upper lobe mass of his left  lung and multiple lymphadenectasis, including mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes,  and also to the right intrapulmonary lymph nodes. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma after a biopsy was conducted on the upper lobe mass of his left lung. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received pemetrexed plus cisplatin (Pem-Cis) treatment for 6 cycles and sequential thoracic radiation as a therapeutic schedule. CT demonstrated a confirmed partial response after these treatments. Three months later, the tumors continued to grow. The patient received successive pemetrexed-based chemotherapy regimens; however, these regimens failed to stop tumor progression. The patient subsequently underwent 6 cycles of PD-1 mAb pembrolizumab treatment. Sensitivity of chemotherapy was restored, and the patient displayed a reduction in the size of enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes after 2 cycles of treatment with Pem-Cis, the initially used chemotherapy regimen. LESSONS: This outcome suggests that PD-1 blockade holds promise as a treatment strategy for reversion of chemotherapy resistance in refractory lung adenocarcinoma and warrants additional studies."

Moreover, all biopsy-based tests are subject to the errors and limitations of invasive tissue collection3-11. Preclinical studies of  positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging with antibodies to PD-L1 suggested that this imaging method might be an approach to selecting patients12,13. Such a  technique, however, requires substantial clinical development and validation. Here we present the initial results from a first-in-human study to assess the feasibility of imaging with zirconium-89-labeled atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), including biodistribution, and secondly test its potential to predict response to PD-L1 blockade (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT02453984 and NCT02478099). We imaged 22 patients across three tumor types before the start of atezolizumab therapy. The PET signal, a function of tracer exposure and target expression, was high in lymphoid tissues and at sites of inflammation. In tumors, uptake was generally high but heterogeneous, varying within and among lesions, patients, and tumor types. Intriguingly, clinical responses in our patients were better correlated with pretreatment PET signal than with immunohistochemistry- or RNA-sequencing-based predictive biomarkers, encouraging further development of molecular PET imaging for assessment of PD-L1 status and clinical response prediction."

The pharmacokinetic data were analyzed using Phoenix NLME software (Version 7.0, Certara, St. Louis, MO) based on a previously reported population pharmacokinetics (PPK) model of nivolumab. Nivolumab was selectively detected in human plasma and the linear range  was 5-200 mcg/mL (R = 0.99). The accuracy and intraday and interday imprecision were within ±15% of the quality control values of 5 (lower limit of quantification), 10 (low), 80 (medium), and 160 (high) mcg/mL. The nivolumab concentrations measured using LC-MS/MS were consistent with those of previously reported PPK models, and the pharmacokinetic parameters could be adequately predicted from a single trough concentration using a Bayesian approach.

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients with NSCLC administered nivolumab therapy at Toneyama National Hospital, Japan, from January 2016 to January 2018. Of the 87 patients administered nivolumab therapy, five experienced rapid progression during one cycle of nivolumab therapy. Four patients were treated with corticosteroids to overcome their symptomatic events. Nivolumab exhibited efficacy after temporal progression, so-called pseudoprogression, in three patients, and their symptoms and laboratory results improved. In the other patient, pleural and pericardial effusions increased after nivolumab therapy, and drainage was required, with no subsequent recurrence. The clinical courses of our case series indicate that alternative treatment, namely high-dose corticosteroids, antibiotics, and drainage, effectively treated the symptoms of rapid tumor progression. Of note, corticosteroids suppressed the temporary inflammatory reaction to nivolumab.

Nevertheless, it is essential that testing laboratories are able to fulfil licencing criteria by providing the  tests which have been validated as providing useful predictive information. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression assessment is now established in routine practice, although the situation regarding the selection of a particular assay remains complex, and testing protocols are likely to change in future. It is probable that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression assessment will be supplemented in the near future by tumour mutation burden (TMB), but this will require novel solutions to allow testing to be completed using small tissue samples and within narrow timeframes.

Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) became available for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although ICIs showed a survival advantage in comparison with chemotherapy in the second and first-line setting, overall response rate is only around 20% and a large proportion of patients will undergo  disease progression within the first weeks of treatment. For this reason, there is a need for biomarkers to predict the efficacy of ICIs in NSCLC and to identify patients who will benefit from ICIs. The first biomarker developed was programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. However, the predictive role of PD-L1 expression varied from one clinical trial to another, due to the multiple assays  used, with different antibodies, different platforms, and different thresholds. Moreover, PD-L1 expression is highly heterogeneous. For these reasons, PD-L1 expression alone is not a good biomarker to predict the efficacy of ICIs and there is a need for the identification of other biomarkers. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is defined as the number of mutations per DNA megabases. It was first assessed as a biomarker for ICI based on the observation of successful immune checkpoint inhibition in solid tumors with high TMB such as NSCLC, melanoma or bladder cancer. Pre-clinical data suggested that the association between TMB and ICIs efficacy could be explained by the creation of neoantigens induced by mutations acquisition, increasing tumor immunogenicity and response to ICIs. Preliminary observations of TMB role as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of ICIs in patients with advanced NSCLC led to the assessment of TMB clinical utility in phase III clinical trials. This review reports the clinical features and prognostic role of TMB in NSCLC. This review also focuses on TMB predictive role for the treatment of NSCLC patients with single-agent programmed  cell death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab or ICIs combination."

However, not all lung cancer patients receive the same benefit from this treatment, leading to limitations in the number of patients who can receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint  inhibitors because some secondary toxicity has been associated with immunotherapy, and because some patients would benefit more from chemotherapy. In this context, the selection of patients is currently based on PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), specifically on the percentage of PD-L1 positive tumor cells. To date, this is the only validated biomarker that is used as a companion diagnostic test for immunotherapy in non-small cell carcinoma lung (NSCLC) patients. However, this biomarker is not sufficiently robust and demonstrates many challenges. For example, some patients with more than 50% PD-L1 positive tumor cells are non-responders to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, while conversely, other patients with no PD-L1 positive tumor cells are good responders. The tumor mutation burden (TMB) or tumor mutation load (TML) emerged  recently as a new predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response in NSCLC. However, this biomarker needs to be validated for routine clinical use and shares similar constraints with the PD-L1 IHC biomarker. PD-L1 IHC and TMB are currently the two best predictive biomarkers that could soon be used to systematically inform treatment decisions in advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients. The aim of this review is to consider the possible integration of TMB testing in daily practice through a pros- and cons-debate, and to establish sample quality-dependent algorithms and the main current constraints for laboratories considering TMB assessments."

The gold standard treatment is complete surgical resection which can be followed by radio/chemotherapy in selected cases. Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition can be  considered in only a limited number of aggressive or metastatic tumors as EGFR, BRAF, or c-kit mutations are rare. However, previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in epithelial neoplasias, such as in programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressing nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. Because of their rare occurrence the data on PD-L1 distribution in thymic neoplasias are limited. PD-L1 and PD-1 expression in tumor cells and tumor infiltrating immune cells was determined in TETs according to criteria published  for lung carcinomas. Comparison with major clinical, pathologic, and biological features was also done. In total, 36 TETs (29 thymomas and 7 thymic carcinomas) were analyzed. PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining (Ventana PD-L1 clone SP142) was performed in all cases. The percentage of the positive tumor cells (TC value), the percentage of tumor area occupied by positive immune cells (IC value) was evaluated. Evaluation of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells showed a good reproducibility (κ-value: 0.840; Spearman r=0.966; P<0.0001). About 69% of thymomas (20/29) and 43% of thymic carcinomas (3/7) showed high positivity rate (TC≥50% or IC ≥10%), which may indicate therapeutic advantage similar to nonsmall cell lung cancers defined by the same conditions. PD-L1 expression is common in different epithelial tumors of the thymus, which suggests the potential effectiveness of drugs targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interactions in these neoplasms."

Therefore, understanding T cell composition and phenotype in human tumors is crucial. We analyzed by flow cytometry tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from two independent cohorts of patients with different cancer types, including RCC, lung, and colon cancer. In healthy donors, peripheral T cells are  usually either CD4+ or CD8+ with a small percentage of CD4+ CD8+ DP cells (<5%).  Compared to several other cancer types, including lung, and colorectal cancers, TILs from about a third of RCC patients showed an increased proportion of DP CD4+CD8+ T cells (>5%, reaching 30-50% of T cells in some patients). These DP T cells have an effector memory phenotype and express CD38, 4-1BB, and HLA-DR, suggesting antigen-driven expansion. In fact, TCR sequencing analysis revealed a  high degree of clonality in DP T cells. Additionally, there were high levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 expression on DP T cells, which correlated with higher expression  of PD-1 and TIM-3 in conventional single positive CD8 T cells from the same patients. These results suggest that DP T cells could be dysfunctional tumor-specific T cells with the potential to be reactivated by checkpoint inhibitors."

However, whether patients' immune cells co-exist in PDXs remains uncharacterized. We cultured small pieces of lung PDX tissue in media containing human interleukin-2 and characterized the proliferated lymphocytes by flow cytometric assays with antibodies specific for human immune cell surface markers. Presence of immune cells in PDXs was also determined by immunohistochemical staining. Human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were cultured from nine of 25 PDX samples (36%). The mean time of PDX growth in immunodeficient mice before  obtaining TILs in culture was 113 days (range 63-292 days). The TILs detected in  PDXs were predominantly human CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, or CD19+ B cells, depending on cases. DNA fingerprint analysis showed that the TILs originated from the same patients as the PDXs. Further analysis of two PDX-derived CD8+ T cells showed that they were PD-1-, CD45RO+, and either CD62L+ or CD62L-, suggesting they were likely memory T cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed that human T cells (CD8+ or CD4+), B cells (CD19+), and macrophages (CD68+) were present in stroma or intraepithelial cancer structures and that human PD-L1 was expressed in stromal cells. Moreover, the patient-derived immune cells in PDX can be passaged  to the F2 generation and may migrate to spleens of PDX-bearing mice. Patient-derived immune cells co-exist in early passages of PDXs in some lung cancer PDX models. The CD8+ cells from PDXs were likely memory T cells. These results suggest that PDXs can be used for evaluating the functionality of immune components in tumor microenvironments."

The quantification of PD-L1 expression currently includes the visual estimation by a pathologist of the percentage (tumor proportional scoring or TPS) of tumor cells showing PD-L1 staining. Known challenges like differences in positivity estimation around clinically relevant cut-offs and sub-optimal quality of samples makes visual scoring tedious and subjective, yielding a scoring variability between pathologists. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning solution that enables the first automated and objective scoring of PD-L1 expression in late stage NSCLC needle biopsies. To account for the low amount of tissue available in biopsy images and to restrict the amount of manual annotations necessary for training, we explore the use of semi-supervised approaches against standard fully supervised methods. We consolidate the manual annotations used for training as well the visual TPS scores used for quantitative evaluation with multiple pathologists. Concordance measures computed on a set of slides unseen during training provide evidence that our automatic scoring method matches visual scoring on the considered dataset while ensuring repeatability and objectivity."

To date, no blood biomarkers have been identified in NSCLC to predict clinical outcomes of treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies. PATIENT AND We performed an analysis of retrospectively registered data  of 157 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies at Mayo Clinic in Florida and Rochester. White blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), ANC to ALC (ANC: ALC) ratio, absolute eosinophil count, absolute monocyte count (AMC), platelet counts, and myeloid to lymphoid (M:L) ratio at baseline and throughout treatment were assessed. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were performed. We treated 146 patients with nivolumab and 11 with pembrolizumab between January 1, 2015 and April 15, 2017. At median follow-up of 20 months, median OS and PFS were 6.0 and 2.6 months, respectively. Higher baseline ANC, AMC, ANC: ALC ratio and M: L ratio correlated with worse clinical outcomes in patients who underwent anti-PD-1 treatment. A baseline ANC: ALC ratio of 5.9 or higher had a significantly increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] =1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.03; P = 0.004) and disease progression (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.17-2.34; P = 0.005) compared with patients with lower ratio. Similarly, a baseline M: L ratio of 11.3 or higher had significantly increased risk of death (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.54-4.05; P < 0.001), even after a multivariate analysis (HR,  2.31; P = 0.002), compared to those with lower ratio. Increased baseline ANC: ALC ratio and M: L ratio before initiation of anti-PD1 antibodies were associated with poor PFS and OS in advanced NSCLC patients. The potential predictive value of these readily available biomarkers might help with risk stratification and treatment strategies. These findings warrant further investigation in a larger, prospective study."

Methods: Tissue microarray cores of paraffin-embedded blocks from 135 cases with surgically resected tongue  SCC were immunohistochemically analysed for PD-L1 expression. Results: We observed a positive correlation between PD-L1 expression and tongue SCC pT1 and pT2 tumours, but a negative correlation with pT2, pT3 and pT4 tumours. We also observed a positive correlation with lymph node metastasis. However, no positive  correlation was demonstrated between PD-L1 expression and overall survival. PD-L1 tends to be overexpressed at the early stage of tongue SCC, showing a close correlation with initial development of tongue. However, PD-L1 expression may not affect prognosis."

In contrast, only very limited information is available about the efficacy of these therapies in non-melanoma skin cancers, especially in basal cell carcinoma. The latter malignancy is often  associated with both an impairment of the host immune response and a high mutation burden, suggesting that immune checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy  may be effective in the treatment of this tumor. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with a metastatic non-small-cell-lung-cancer. Following the lack of response to two lines of systemic chemotherapy, she was treated with the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab, obtaining a prolonged stable disease. Under nivolumab treatment, the patient developed a basal cell carcinoma of the nose. The latter was surgically resected. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue showed a PD-L1 expression  < 1% and lack of human leukocyte antigen class I subunit (i.e. heavy and light chain) expression on tumor cells. In addition, a limited number of T cells (CD3+) was present in the tumor microenvironment, with a higher number of regulatory T cells (Foxp3+) and macrophages (Cd11b+) as compared to a low infiltration of activated cytotoxic T cells (CD8+/ Granzyme B+). Two months following the surgical removal of the tumor, while still on nivolumab treatment, the patient relapsed with a basal cell carcinoma in the same anatomic site of the previous surgical excision. The tumor displayed the same pathological characteristics. CONCLUSION: Preclinical lines of evidence suggest a potential role of immune checkpoint inhibitors for basal cell carcinoma treatment. However, limited clinical data is available. In the patient we have described administration of the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab for the treatment of a responsive non-small cell carcinoma was associated with the development and relapse of a basal cell carcinoma tumor. This association is likely to reflect the resistance  of basal cell carcinoma cells to anti-PD-1 based immunotherapy because of a cold tumor microenvironment characterized by lack of human leukocyte antigen class I expression, low PD-L1 expression and high number of immune regulatory cells."

Recently, it has become evident that CD103+ TRM are not only important in combating secondary infections, but also for the elimination of tumor cells. In several solid cancers, intratumoral CD103+CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), with TRM properties, are a positive prognostic marker. To better understand the role of TRM in tumors, we performed a detailed characterization of CD8+ and CD4+ TIL phenotype and functional properties in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Frequencies of CD8+ and CD4+ T  cell infiltrates in tumors were comparable, but we observed a sharp contrast in TRM ratios compared to surrounding lung tissue. The majority of both CD4+ and CD8+ TILs expressed CD69 and a subset also expressed CD103, both hallmarks of TRM. While CD103+CD8+ T cells were enriched in tumors, CD103+CD4+ T cell frequencies were decreased compared to surrounding lung tissue. Furthermore, CD103+CD4+ and CD103+CD8+ TILs showed multiple characteristics of TRM, such as elevated expression of CXCR6 and CD49a, and decreased expression of T-bet and Eomes. In line with the immunomodulatory role of the tumor microenvironment, CD8+ and CD4+ TILs expressed high levels of inhibitory receptors 2B4, CTLA-4, and PD-1, with the highest levels found on CD103+ TILs. Strikingly, CD103+CD4+ TILs were the most potent producers of TNF-α and IFN-γ, while other TIL subsets lacked such cytokine production. Whereas, CD103+CD4+PD-1low TILs produced the most effector cytokines, CD103+CD4+PD-1++ and CD69+CD4+PD-1++ TILs produced CXCL13. Furthermore, a large proportion of TILs expressed co-stimulatory receptors CD27 and CD28, unlike lung TRM, suggesting a less differentiated phenotype. Agonistic  triggering of these receptors improved cytokine production of CD103+CD4+ and CD69+CD8+ TILs. Our findings thus provide a rationale to target CD103+CD4+ TILs and add co-stimulation to current therapies to improve the efficacy of immunotherapies and cancer vaccines."

The majority of patients either do not respond or develop resistance to monotherapy over time. Here, we investigated the efficacy of OX40 (CD134) stimulation as an alternative immunotherapeutic approach in combination with radiotherapy (XRT) in a murine model of anti-PD1-resistant lung tumors.Experimental Design: We established a bilateral tumor model in 129Sv/Ev mice using an anti-PD1-resistant lung tumor cell line. Primary tumors were treated with intratumoral injection of an OX40 agonist antibody, given as adjuvant therapy after XRT (36 Gy in three 12-Gy fractions), whereas secondary tumors were left untreated to investigate abscopal outcomes.Results: The combination of XRT followed by OX40 stimulation effectively inhibited local and systemic antitumor growth, limited lung metastases, and improved survival rates.  This treatment regimen augmented CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell expansion. XRT induced the  expression of OX40 on T cells in tumors and spleens and increased the percentages of splenic CD103+ dendritic cells.Our data extend the benefits of radiation to systemic disease control, especially when combined with anti-OX40 agonist to promote immunologically mediated abscopal effects.

However, factors that can robustly predict long-lasting responses are still needed.Experimental Design: We performed in-depth immune profiling of lung adenocarcinoma using an integrative analysis based on immunohistochemistry, flow-cytometry, and transcriptomic data. Tumor mutational status was investigated using next-generation sequencing. The response to PD-1 blockers was analyzed from a prospective cohort according to tumor mutational profiles and PD-L1 expression, and a public clinical database was used to validate the results obtained.Results: We showed that distinct combinations of STK11, EGFR, and TP53 mutations were major determinants of the tumor immune profile (TIP) and of the expression of PD-L1 by malignant cells. Indeed, the presence of TP53 mutations without co-occurring STK11 or EGFR alterations (TP53-mut/STK11-EGFR-WT), independently of KRAS mutations, identified the group of tumors with the highest CD8 T-cell density and PD-L1 expression. In this tumor subtype, pathways related to T-cell chemotaxis, immune cell cytotoxicity, and antigen processing were upregulated. Finally, a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS: HR = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.63, P < 0.001) was observed in anti-PD-1-treated patients harboring TP53-mut/STK11-EGFR-WT tumors.

The success of immune checkpoint blockade therapies is driven by immunogenicity of tumor cells, which is associated with mutation burden and neoantigen burden in cancers. Lymphocyte infiltration in cancer tissues and interferon-γ-induced PD-L1 expression in tumor microenvironments may serve as surrogate biomarkers for adaptive immune resistance and likelihood of responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. In contrast, weak immunogenicity of, and/or impaired antigen presentation in, tumor cells are primary causes of resistance to these therapies. Thus, approaches that increase immunogenicity of cancer cells and/or enhance immune cell recruitment to cancer sites will likely overcome resistance to immunotherapy."

Our aim was to study the distribution  of PD-L1 tumor expression by IHC assay type among patients with mNSCLC in US oncology practices. This retrospective observational study utilized de-identified, longitudinal data from a large US electronic medical record database. Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with histologically/cytologically confirmed initial diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent NSCLC from October 2015 through December 2017. We determined PD-L1 testing trends and distribution of PD-L1 tumor expression (percentage of tumor cells staining for PD-L1) by IHC assay type. The 12,574 eligible patients (mean age, 69 years) included 6,620 (53%) men and 86% with positive smoking history. Of 4,868 evaluable tests, 3,799 (78%), 195 (4%), 165 (3%), and 709 (15%) used the Agilent 22C3 pharmDx, Agilent 28-8 pharmDx, Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) Assay, and laboratory-developed tests (LDTs, including SP263), respectively. The percentages of tests scoring PD-L1 tumor expression of ≥50% were 33%, 32%, 10%, and 23%, respectively. Measured PD-L1 tumor expression varied across the four assay types (χ2 p < 0.001) and across three assay types excluding SP142 (p < 0.001), with no significant difference between 22C3 and 28-8 assays (p = 0.96). The PD-L1 testing rate increased from 18% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 71% in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the real-world clinical setting, we observed that measured PD-L1  tumor expression is concordant using the 22C3 and 28-8 assays; however, the SP142 assay and LDTs appear discordant and could underestimate high PD-L1 positivity. Further study is needed to evaluate the association between PD-L1 tumor expression and response to therapy."

We developed a novel model to better understand tumor progression and interaction with immune cells and the cellular components. We grew 393 P non-metastatic and 344SQ metastatic murine cells in an acellular metastatic lung  cancer model, where both cell lines formed circulating tumor cells (CTC) and metastatic lesions. When the CTC from this model were placed in the tail vein of  nu/nu mice, both cell lines formed metastatic lesions. However, in syngeneic immune-competent mice, the CTC from the non-metastatic cell line did not metastasize while the CTC from the metastatic cell line metastasized. When we placed the activated immune cells in the cellular lung model, it decreased CTC and metastatic lesion formation for the non-metastatic cell line while it had no  impact on metastatic cell line. The metastatic cell line had a significant increase in expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL-1) compared to the non-metastatic cell line in the model. Overall, the immune cells showed an impact on viability of CTC for cell lines with a decreased expression of PDL-1 that leads to decreased metastatic lesion formation. Further studies are needed to understand the subtype of immune cells and mechanism of decreased CTC viability and metastasis inhibition."

Methods: This was a multi-center retrospective study, collecting totally 57 advanced lung adenocarcinoma biopsy specimens from four centers from August 2017 to December 2017.The mean age of 57 patients was 59 (range 34-81) years, and 29 cases were male, 28 cases were female. Four PD-L1 immunohistochemical stains were done for each case, including 22C3 (Dako), 28-8 (Abcam), SP263 (Ventana), and SP142 (Ventana). Among them, 22C3 staining was done using Dako autostainer, and for the other three antibodies, Ventana Ultraview detection system and autostainer was used. The immunohistochemical slides were read by two trained histopathologists in a double-blinded way, and the percentage of PD-L1 positive tumor cells was assessed as <1%, 1%-24%, 25%-49% and more than  50%. Results: The Dako 22C3 was used as the standard. There were eight cases in which the PD-L1 staining was more than 50% (14.0%, 8/57). The staining consistency of tumor cells was higher in 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 (ρ=0.729-0.809). The two scoring doctors had a high degree of concordance in PD-L1 positive tumor  cells (ρ=0.707-0.896), and this was most noticeable in 22C3 and SP263. 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 show high consistency in tumor cell staining. The study can provide an effective basis for screening for potential patient population that may benefit from immunotherapy."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive cancers associated with high morbidity and mortality. Based on available data, it's obvious that ICB has limited success in  PDACs, which can be explained by the low immunogenicity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of these tumors. In this review article, we focus on PD-L1 expression and microsatellite instability (MSI) in PDAC, and their roles as prognostic and predictive markers. We also discuss data supporting combination therapies to augment cancer immunity cycle. Combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents with other modalities such as vaccines, chemotherapy, and radiation could potentially  overcome resistance patterns and increase immune responsiveness in PDAC."

We assessed the effect of platinum-based chemotherapy on tumor PD-L1 expression and  its clinical implications. Materials and Methods: We used immunohistochemistry to retrospectively evaluate the percentage of tumor cells with membranous PD-L1 staining (tumor proportion score) in paired tumor specimens obtained before and after platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in 86 patients with NSCLC. We analyzed the correlation between the change in PD-L1 tumor proportion score and clinicopathologic characteristics, response to NACT, and survival. Results: The PD-L1 tumor proportion score increased in a significant proportion of patients with NSCLC after platinum-based NACT (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.002). That pattern was consistent across clinically defined subgroups except  for patients with partial response to NACT. Tumors from 26 patients (30.2%) were  PD-L1‒negative before NACT but PD-L1-positive after NACT, whereas the reverse pattern occurred in six patients (7%) (McNemar's test, p<0.001). Increase in PD-L1 tumor proportion score was significantly associated with lack of response to NACT (Fisher exact test, p=0.015). There was a tendency, albeit not statistically significant, for patients with an increase in PD-L1 tumor proportion score to have shorter survival. Tumor PD-L1 expression increased after platinum-based NACT in a significant proportion of patients with NSCLC. Increase in tumor PD-L1 expression may predict poor clinical outcome."

However, cancer cells, as a strategy to survive and expand, can hijack these molecules and mechanisms to suppress T cell-mediated immune responses. Therefore, an idea of blocking the checkpoint molecules to enhance the anti-tumor activities of the host immune system has been developed and applied to the cancer therapy after discovery of the inhibitory T cell co-receptor, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and further enhanced on the identification of PD-1 and its ligands. Since 2010, several checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by FDA and many more are in clinical trials. In the treatment of advanced cancers, these inhibitors significantly increased response rates and survival benefits. However, accompanied with the striking results, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that broadly occurred in many organs were observed and reported, some of which were fatal. Herein, we first review the recent progressions in the research of the immune checkpoint molecules and the application of their blocking antibodies in cancer treatment, and then discuss the cardiac toxicity induced by the therapy and the strategy to monitor, manage this adverse event when it occurs."

Eligibility for treatment with Pembrolizumab  is based on demonstration of PD-L1 expression on tumoral cells using the approved companion test 22C3 PharmDx (Dako). Access to the drug depends on a tumor proportion score (TPS) expressing the PD-L1 protein above predetermined cutoffs.  The scoring interpretation guide requires a minimum of 100 viable cells to be considered adequate for evaluation. Recent studies have questioned the adequacy of the sampling process when small biopsies are utilized. To further explore this concern, the viable tumor area of 426 consecutive NSCLC biopsies and surgical excisions submitted for PD-L1 assessment was measured and recorded with corresponding PD-L1 expression. About 14.6% of all biopsies measured <2 mm creating 2 groups (<2 mm and ≥2 mm) whose PD-L1 categories distribution [negative (<1%), low expressor (≥1% and <50%), and positive (≥50%)] were compared. Results  were significantly different between both groups (χ test; P=0.0012). To help understand this difference, 1,407,000 in silico simulated biopsies of various sizes were performed on 201 numerical tumors created from digitalized full sections and analyzed. Not only the same results shown in actual biopsies were reproduced, but the model calculated that up to 35% of very small biopsies were misclassified including a mixture of false negative and false positive results. The percentage decreased to 10% with a threshold of 5 mm. In era of precision medicine, appropriate sampling is more than ever critical to achieve accurate assessment of the NSCLC PD-L1.

Tumors can express PD-L1 and evade the immune system. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma, expression of PD-1 in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlates with PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (TCs). However, this relationship has not been thoroughly explored in early disease. OBJECTIVE.—: To investigate the correlation of PD-1 and PD-L1 in non-small cell lung carcinoma tumor samples, with emphasis on stage I disease. DESIGN.—: Whole tissue sections from non-small cell lung carcinoma tumors were retrospectively evaluated by immunohistochemistry for PD-1 and PD-L1 expression.  The scoring was based on the percentage of cells positive for PD-1 in TILs and PD-L1 in TCs and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs). RESULTS.—: Expression of PD-1 in TILs was observed in 147 of 161 non-small cell lung carcinoma cases (91%). The majority of cases negative for PD-1 also lacked PD-L1 in TCs. The 68 cases with highest PD-1 expression in TILs included 33 (49%) with expression of PD-L1 in TCs and ICs. Strong correlations were observed in patients with elevated PD-1 expression in TILs and PD-L1 in TCs ( P = .01) and ICs ( P = .003). Expression of PD-1 also correlated with increased PD-L1 in TCs and ICs when the 2 were grouped together ( P < .001). Finally, stage I patients with negative PD-1 and PD-L1 expression showed trends toward increased disease-specific survival. CONCLUSIONS.—: Expression of PD-1 in TILs correlates with PD-L1 expression in both TCs and ICs. Furthermore, negative expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 suggest trends toward disease-specific survival, even in early disease stages."

Several trials on nivolumab for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have been performed worldwide, and the identification of markers specific to ESCC is urgently needed. We conducted a clinical trial on nivolumab for advanced ESCC (JapicCTI-No.142422) and investigated markers using peripheral  blood collected from 20 patients enrolled in our institute, including 1 with a complete response (CR), 5 with a partial response (PR), 6 with a stable disease (SD), and 8 with a progressive disease (PD) as clinical responses. The expression of surface molecules and cytokine production by T cells were analyzed using flow  cytometry, and clinicopathological factors and general blood parameters were examined. Albumin, neutrophils, %Tim3, %OX40, %CD103, %CD45RA-CD27-, and IL-1b after the first cycle of nivolumab treatment, but not at baseline, distinguished  CR/PR from SD/PD patients. When markers to distinguish longer survivors with nivolumab therapy were analyzed, changes in these levels between baseline and after the first cycle of nivolumab treatment, but not levels at each period, were indicative, similar to the tumor burden. Among them, elevations in %Tim-3+CD4 had a marked impact on survival rates. In conclusion, dynamic elevations in %Tim-3 in T cells in the early period of nivolumab therapy have potential as a marker for the clinical responses and prognosis of advanced ESCC patients."

However, little is known about the safety of this combination, even though the preclinical model suggested a possible synergic effect. We analyzed NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy and nivolumab according to former's timing. We retrospectively reviewed records of a large series of metastatic NSCLC patients from three French centers, irradiated during the 6 months preceding, concomitantly, or 3 months after nivolumab administration to assess nivolumab tolerance and outcomes.

Recently, more immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were demonstrated in patients with lung cancer who were vaccinated with the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine during anti-programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy. Confirmation of these findings is essential before recommendations on influenza vaccination may be revoked. In this cohort study in patients with lung cancer receiving nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks during two influenza seasons (2015/16-2016/17), irAEs have  been monitored. Incidence, timing and severity of irAEs were compared between vaccinated patients and non-vaccinated patients. FINDINGS: In a compassionate use programme, 127 patients with lung cancer had been treated with at least one dose of nivolumab during two national influenza vaccination campaigns from September until December of 2015 and 2016. Forty-two patients had received the influenza vaccine, and 85 patients were not vaccinated. Median follow-up period was 118 days (interquartile range 106-119). Mean age was  64 years (range 46-83). In vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients, the incidence  of irAEs was 26% and 22%, respectively, rate ratio 1.20 (95% confidence interval  [CI] 0.51-2.65). The incidence of serious irAEs was 7% and 4%, respectively, rate ratio 2.07 (95% CI 0.28-15.43). Influenza vaccination while receiving nivolumab did not result in significant differences in the rates of discontinuation, death, clinical deterioration or tumour response between the groups. INTERPRETATION: Influenza vaccination in patients with lung cancer receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy does not induce irAEs in our cohort. With this result, influenza vaccination should not be deterred from this group of patients."

Two inhibitory molecules, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), got high attention, as inhibition of  CTLA-4 or PD-1 signaling provides the first immune therapy that significantly improves the survival of patients with metastatic solid cancers. Inhibition of CTLA-4 or PD-1 was first studied in and approved for patients with metastatic melanoma. Blocking immune checkpoints is also efficient in non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cell cancers, hypermutated gastrointestinal cancers, and others. Immune responses, whether directed against infections or against tumors, are divided into 2 phases: an initiation phase and an activation phase, where the immune system recognizes a danger signal and becomes activated by innate signals  to fight the danger. This reaction is fundamental for the control of infections and cancer, but needs to be turned off once the danger is controlled, because persistence of this activation ultimately causes severe tissue damage. Therefore, each activation of the immune system is followed by a termination phase, where endogenous immune suppressor molecules arrest immune responses to prevent harmful damage. In the case of cancer immune therapies, therapeutic approaches classically enhanced the initiation and activation of immune responses to increase the emergence and the efficacy of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against  cancers. In sharp contrast, immune checkpoint blockade focuses on the termination of immune responses by inhibiting immune suppressor molecules. It thus prevents the termination of immune responses or even awakes those CTLs that became exhausted during an immune response. Therefore, blocking negatively regulating immune checkpoints restores the capacity of exhausted CTL to kill the cancer they infiltrate. In addition, they drive surviving cancer cells into a still poorly defined state of dormancy. As the therapy also awakes self-reactive CTL, one downside of the therapy is the induction of organ-specific autoimmune diseases. The second downside is the exorbitant drug price that withdraws patients in need  from a therapy that was developed by academic research, which impairs further academic treatment development and financially charges the public health system."

Thus, new targets acting on T cells are needed.

Here, we show an upregulation of Siglecs, including Siglec-9, on tumor-infiltrating T cells from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal, and ovarian cancer patients. Siglec-9-expressing T cells coexpressed several inhibitory receptors, including PD-1. Targeting of the sialoglycan-SAMP/Siglec pathway in vitro and in vivo resulted in increased anticancer immunity. T cell expression of Siglec-9 in NSCLC patients correlated with reduced survival, and Siglec-9 polymorphisms showed association with the risk of developing lung and colorectal cancer. Our data identify the sialoglycan-SAMP/Siglec pathway as a potential target for improving T cell activation for immunotherapy."

Nivolumab prevents programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) binding, resulting in blockage of the inhibitory signal and thus facilitating an immunologic antitumor response. Nivolumab has been shown to be effective in thoracic malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here is a case of 52-year male patient with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma progressing after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. We started nivolumab q2 weeks therapy. Firstly, his dyspnea relieved, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels regressed, and then their levels remained constant at a stable level. Radiologically stable response was seen. Progression was seen after about one and half year. Patient died in a short time after progression. In conclusion, this observation provides  a strong indication of the potential value of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the management of metastatic lung cancers."

We retrospectively evaluated patients who received EGFR-TKIs for advanced NSCLC at the Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute between April 2016 and September 2017 and were not enrolled in clinical studies. The patients' EGFR and  PD-L1 statuses were simultaneously evaluated. Among the 101 eligible patients, strong PD-L1 expression significantly decreased objective response rate, compared with weak or negative PD-L1 expression (35.7% versus 63.2% versus 67.3%, p = 0.002), and shortened progression-free survival (3.8 versus 6.0 versus 9.5 months, p < 0.001), regardless of EGFR mutation type (19del or L858R). Furthermore, positive PD-L1 expression was predominantly observed among patients with de novo resistance rather than acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs (66.7% versus 30.2%, p = 0.009). Notably, we found a high proportion of PD-L1 and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) dual-positive cases among patients with de novo resistance (46.7%, 7 of 15). Finally, one patient with de novo resistance to EGFR-TKIs and PD-L1 and CD8  dual positivity experienced a favorable response to anti-programmed death 1 therapy. This study revealed the adverse effects of PD-L1 expression on EGFR-TKI efficacy, especially in NSCLC patients with de novo resistance. The findings indicate the reshaping of an inflamed immune phenotype characterized by  PD-L1 and CD8 dual positivity and suggest potential therapeutic sensitivity to programmed death 1 blockade."

The rate and outcome of HPD in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are unknown. Objectives: To investigate whether HPD is observed in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared with single-agent chemotherapy  and whether there is an association between treatment and HPD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this multicenter retrospective study that included patients treated between August 4, 2011, and April 5, 2017, the setting  was pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC who received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (8 institutions) or single-agent chemotherapy (4 institutions) in France. Measurable disease defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) on at least 2 computed tomographic scans before treatment and 1 computed tomographic scan during treatment was required. Interventions: The tumor growth rate (TGR) before and during treatment and variation per month (ΔTGR) were calculated. Hyperprogressive disease was defined  as disease progression at the first evaluation with ΔTGR exceeding 50%. The primary end point was assessment of the HPD rate  in patients treated with IO or chemotherapy. Results: Among 406 eligible patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (63.8% male), 46.3% (n = 188) were 65 years or older, 72.4% (n = 294) had nonsquamous histology, and 92.9% (n = 377) received a PD-1 inhibitor as monotherapy in second-line therapy or later. The median follow-up was 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.1-13.8 months), and the median overall survival (OS) was 13.4 months (95% CI,  10.2-17.0 months). Fifty-six patients (13.8%) were classified as having HPD. Pseudoprogression was observed in 4.7% (n = 19) of the population. Hyperprogressive disease was significantly associated with more than 2 metastatic sites before PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared with non-HPD (62.5% [35 of 56] vs 42.6% [149 of 350]; P = .006). Patients experiencing HPD within the first 6 weeks of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment had significantly lower OS compared with patients with progressive disease (median OS, 3.4 months [95% CI, 2.8-7.5 months] vs 6.2 months [95% CI, 5.3-7.9 months]; hazard ratio, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.29-3.69]; P = .003). Among 59 eligible patients treated with chemotherapy, 3 (5.1%) were classified as having HPD. Our study suggests that HPD is more common with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared with chemotherapy in pretreated patients with NSCLC and is also associated with high metastatic burden and poor prognosis in patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Additional studies are needed to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in HPD."

In this trial we investigated the efficacy and safety of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with NSCLC who had already received platinum-based therapy. JAVELIN Lung 200 was a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial at 173 hospitals and cancer treatment centres in 31 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had stage IIIB or IV or recurrent NSCLC  and disease progression after treatment with a platinum-containing doublet, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1, an estimated life expectancy of more than 12 weeks, and adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice-response system with a stratified permuted block method with variable block length, to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥1% vs <1% of tumour cells), which was measured with the 73-10 assay, and histology (squamous vs non-squamous). The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed when roughly 337 events (deaths) had occurred in the PD-L1-positive population. Efficacy was analysed in all PD-L1-positive patients (ie, PD-L1 expression in ≥1% of tumour cells) randomly assigned to study treatment (the primary analysis population) and then in all randomly assigned patients through a hierarchical testing procedure. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02395172. Enrolment is complete, but the trial is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between March 24, 2015, and Jan 23, 2017, 792 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive avelumab (n=396) or docetaxel (n=396). 264 participants in the avelumab group and 265 in the docetaxel group had PD-L1-positive tumours. In patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, median overall survival did not differ significantly between the avelumab and docetaxel groups (11·4 months [95% CI 9·4-13·9] vs 10·3 months [8·5-13·0]; hazard ratio 0·90 [96%  CI 0·72-1·12]; one-sided p=0·16). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 251 (64%) of 393 avelumab-treated patients and 313 (86%) of 365 docetaxel-treated patients, including grade 3-5 events in 39 (10%) and 180 (49%) patients, respectively. The most common grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events were infusion-related reaction (six patients [2%]) and increased lipase (four [1%]) in the avelumab group and neutropenia (51 [14%]), febrile neutropenia (37 [10%]), and decreased neutrophil counts (36 [10%]) in the docetaxel group. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 34 (9%) patients in the avelumab group and 75 (21%) in the docetaxel group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four (1%) participants in the avelumab group, two due to interstitial lung disease, one due to acute kidney injury, and one due to a combination of autoimmune myocarditis, acute cardiac failure, and respiratory failure. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 14 (4%) patients in the docetaxel group, three due to pneumonia, and one each due to febrile neutropenia, septic shock, febrile neutropenia with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, cardiovascular  insufficiency, renal impairment, leucopenia with mucosal inflammation and pyrexia, infection, neutropenic infection, dehydration, and unknown causes. INTERPRETATION: Compared with docetaxel, avelumab did not improve overall survival in patients with platinum-treated PD-L1-positive NSCLC, but had a favourable safety profile.

However, few reports exist with integrated analysis, to interpret the underlying  mechanism of poor response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. We have retrospectively analyzed the tumor microenvironment (TME) based on tumor PD-L1 expression and CD8+ T cells infiltration in patients with EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements, and the prognostic value of TME subtypes on overall survival (OS). Tumor samples from 715 patients with lung cancer were retrospectively collected at Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute. Tumoral PD-L1 expression (N = 715) and CD8+ T cells infiltration (N = 658) was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), based on which TME was categorized into four different subtypes: PD-L1+/CD8+, PD-L1-/CD8+, PD-L1+/CD8-, PD-L1-/CD8-. Proportion of four TME subtypes was determined, and overall survival with PD-L1 expression and TME was analyzed. In patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, proportion of PD-L1+/CD8+ tumors was the lowest (5.0%, 17/342), and that of PD-L1-/CD8- tumors  was the highest (63.5%, 217/342). In patients with wild-type EGFR and ALK, 14.2%  (45/316) tumors were PD-L1+/CD8+ and 50.3% (159/316) tumors were PD-L1-/CD8- (P < 0.001). Median OS of EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged lung cancer was 78.6 months in PD-L1 positive group and 93.4 months in PD-L1 negative group (HR 0.47,  95%CI 0.23-0.76, P = 0.005). PD-L1+/CD8+ group exhibited the shortest OS, with 44.3 months, but is likely to respond to CPIs. The PD-L1-/CD8+ group exhibited the longest OS but is unlikely to respond to CPIs. CONCLUSION: Patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements exhibited lower PD-L1 and CD8 co-expression level in TME, which could be responsible for poor response to CPIs. PD-L1 and CD8 co-expression in EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged lung cancer is a biomarker for poor prognosis with shorter OS."

However, the relationship between pulmonary fibrosis/emphysema and the incidence  of anti-PD-1-related pneumonitis is unclear. We retrospectively reviewed data from 123 patients who were diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer and treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) at the Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Japan, between December 17, 2015, and November 30, 2017. Patients who previously  received thoracic radiotherapy to the primary lesion, mediastinum, spinal, or rib metastases were excluded from the analysis. Fibrosis score (0-5) and emphysema score (0-4) on baseline chest computed tomography (CT) were determined by two diagnostic radiologists. Eighteen patients (14.6%) experienced anti-PD-1-related pneumonitis, of  which four (3.3%) were grade ≥3. The median onset time of pneumonitis after starting anti-PD-1 therapy was 60 days (range, 6-634 days). According to the analysis of fibrosis score, pneumonitis occurred in 13 (35.1%) of the 37 patients with a fibrosis score ≥1 and in 5 (5.8%) of 86 patients with a fibrosis score of  0. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that fibrosis score ≥1 was the only risk factor for anti-PD-1-related pneumonitis (p = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis significantly increases the risk of anti-PD-1-related pneumonitis. Further studies are needed to identify predictive factors of anti-PD-1-related pneumonitis in patients with fibrotic changes on CT findings."

HVEM expressed on tumor cell membranes activates immune cell signaling pathways leading to either inhibition of activity (B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator, BTLA) or activation of immune activity (LIGHT). The aim  of this study is to investigate the prevalence of HVEM expression and its association with PDL1 expression in NSCLC. A TMA of 527 resected NSCLC samples and 56 NSCLC cell lines were evaluated for HVEM and PD-L1 expression. The IHC assay for HVEM was optimized on  the Dako Link48 autostainer using a polyclonal antibody from R&D Systems(AF356).  PD-L1 IHC was performed on the Dako Link48 autostainer using the PD-L1 28-8 pharmDx kit. Scoring HVEM employed the H-score system while for PD-L1 the tumor proportion score (TPS) was used. HVEM expression in the NSCLC resected samples and cell lines revealed a  positive H-score more than 1 was 18.6% (77/415) and 48.2% (27/56) respectively. HVEM expression was significantly higher in patients with lymph node N2 metastasis (25.5% vs 7.9% vs 17.5%, p = 0.046) when comparing with N1 or no lymph node metastasis, and was marginally significantly higher in patients with stage III/IV disease (24.5% vs 16.4%, p = 0.059). Subgroup analysis showed that HVEM (median 45 vs 36 months, p = 0.706) and PD-L1 expression (median 45 vs 48 months, p = 0.178) status was not predictive of overall survival. HVEM was found to have  a significant negative correlation with PD-L1 expression (r=-0.274, p < 0.001) in patients with NSCLC and also a weak negative correlation in NSCLC cell lines (r=-0.162, p = 0.352). CONCLUSION: HVEM was found to be overexpressed in NSCLC patients of N2 lymph node metastasis or later stage and has a negative co-relationship with PD-L1 expression. HVEM was not prognostic for NSCLC patients."

We thus examined two xenograft models used for this purpose, with the aim of optimizing them. One method involves the use of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cell line-derived xenografts (PBMCs-CDX model). For this model, we implanted human lung cancer cells into NOD-scid-IL2Rg-/- (NSI) mice, followed by injection of human PBMCs. The second method involves the use of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and CDX (HSPCs-CDX model). For this model, we first reconstituted the human immune system by transferring human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs-derived humanized model) and then transplanted human lung cancer cells. We found that the PBMCs-CDX model was more accurate in evaluating PD-L1/PD-1 targeted immunotherapies. In addition, it took only four weeks with the PBMCs-CDX model for efficacy evaluation, compared to 10-14 weeks with the HSPCs-CDX model.  We then further established PBMCs-derived patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models, including an auto-PBMCs-PDX model using cancer and T cells from the same  tumor, and applied them to assess the antitumor efficacies of anti-PD-L1 antibodies. We demonstrated that this PBMCs-derived PDX model was an invaluable tool to study the efficacies of PD-L1/PD-1 targeted cancer immunotherapies. Overall, we found our PBMCs-derived models to be excellent preclinical models for studying immune checkpoint inhibitors."

Although PD-1 antibody has been reported effective in some malignant tumor, it can also induce significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such  as autoimmune diabetes. A 67-year-old male patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLS) presented with polydipsia, polyuria, weakness, and weight loss after use  of anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody therapy. Hyperglycemia, high serum ketone, low bicarbonate and high anion gap were compatible with the criteria of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DIAGNOSES: Autoimmune diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The presence of low serum titers of c-peptide, high blood glucose together with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) that occurs shortly after the use of pembrolizumab strongly supported the diagnosis of anti-PD-1 induced autoimmune diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: The patient stopped using pembrolizumab while continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) was started at the same time. The insulin infusion was switched to multiple daily injection (MDI) after he was discharged from hospital. The patient is now a well-controlled insulin-dependent patient with palliative care of NSCLS. LESSONS: Autoimmune diabetes induced by anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy is a rare, but life threatening immune-related side effect. Physicians should closely monitor diabetes-related indexes of patients who have been undergoing the treatment of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy."

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an alternative locoregional therapy for patients with inoperable NSCLC. We report the role of RFA in a patient with metastasis from advanced stage NSCLC that was managed with checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, this combination of RFA with subsequent immunotherapy can control NSCLC better than RFA or immunotherapy on their own. We report here a 61-year-old Chinese male who presented with postoperative recurrence squamous cell lung cancer following the left upper lobectomy and 4 cycles of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy 6 months back. DIAGNOSIS: A newly occurring lesion was detected in the left lower lung. Based on computed tomography (CT) and percutaneous lung biopsy enhancement, the patient was diagnosed with stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: The patient refused systemic chemotherapy. And there was no basis  for using tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RFA was performed for 3 times at the left lower lung lesion, which was under control. Afterward, an enlargement of the lesion at left lower lung with involvement to chest wall, and new nodules in both lungs were revealed. After that, the patient received intravenous PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors Atezolizumab. Follow-up restaging CT scan showed disease progression in both lungs. However, by treated 4 months later, partial response was observed at the left lower lung lesion, and stable response was observed at the right upper lung lesion. The patient displayed a remarkable response to Atezolizumab in one lesion at left lower lung, where he received previous locoregional therapy of RFA. As a comparison, another lesion at right upper lung without RFA history showed little response to Atezolizumab. LESSONS: Our case suggests a significantly synergistic effect of sequential association of RFA and subsequent immunotherapy. Integrating locoregional therapy such as RFA into anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent regimens may help to release tumor-associated antigen and mediate T-cell immune enhancement, and on the long run improve the ongoing efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. The combination of locoregional therapy and immunotherapy represents a potential new treatment option in the management of metastatic NSCLC."

The PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx kit is FDA-approved as a complementary diagnostic and CE-marked as an in vitro diagnostic device for nivolumab therapy in melanoma and specific lung cancer subtypes (and for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck/urothelial  carcinoma in Europe only). Kit availability is limited outside the United States, and its use requires the Dako Autostainer Link 48 platform, which is unavailable  in many laboratories. Validated laboratory-developed tests based on 28-8 concentrated antibody outside the kit are needed. This study compared the results from PD-L1 expression level analysis across four immunohistochemistry platforms (Dako Autostainer Link 48, Dako Omnis, Leica Bond-III, and Ventana BenchMark ULTRA) with the 28-8 pharmDx kit in lung cancer (multiple histologies), melanoma, and head and neck cancer (multiple histologies). Samples were prepared per protocol for each platform and stained using PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx kit on Dako Autostainer Link 48, and per protocol for each platform. The control samples (tonsil and placenta tissue; cell lines with prespecified PD-L1 expression levels) were tested to evaluate the specificity and the sensitivity of test assays. An agreement level of 0.90 with the pharmDx kit was set for each platform. Inter- and intra-assay reliability were assessed. Evaluable samples were lung cancer = 29; melanoma = 31; head and neck cancer = 30. Mean agreement was calculated for PD-L1 expression levels of ≥1%, ≥5%, ≥10%, and ≥50%. Mean overall agreement for all indications was 0.87-0.99. Inter- and intra-assay of scoring/classification repeatability was 100%. Analysis of PD-L1 expression levels using laboratory-developed immunohistochemistry assays with 28-8 antibody  may be permissible if the platform is validated using reference samples with defined expression levels."

In multivariable models that adjusted for age, stage,  and number of prior anticancer therapies, we found no significant race-based disparities in anti-PD1 treatment. However, among patients with NSCLC, males had  significantly higher odds of receiving anti-PD1 treatment compared with females (odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.24, p = .02). This finding suggests that as anti-PD1 agents enter the market to transform patient care, it will be critical to monitor for disparities in the use of these drugs."

Cervical cancer is  the fourth most frequent cancer in women worldwide and represents 7.9% of all female cancers with a higher burden of the disease and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Cervical cancer is largely a preventable disease, since  the introduction of screening tests, the recognition of the human papillomavirus  (HPV) as an etiological agent, and the subsequent development of primary prophylaxis against high risk HPV subtypes. Treatment for relapsed/advanced disease has improved over the last 5 years, since the introduction of antiangiogenic therapy. However, despite advances, the median overall survival for advanced cervical cancer is 16.8 months and the 5-year overall survival for all stages is 68%.

Cases of interstitial pneumonitis induced by anti PD-1 have been widely  described, but there are fewer data with anti PD-L1. Avelumab is a new immunotherapy of the anti PD-L1 class. CASE REPORT: A 66-year-old woman, ex-smoker, had been treated with avelumab and axitinib since November 2016 for renal cell cancer. Interstitial pneumonitis was  discovered accidentally 4 months after the beginning of the treatment, with ground glass opacities, intra-lobular crosslinking and adenopathy of the 4R zone  on the CT scan. An exhaustive assessment did not reveal any respiratory function  defect or an infectious or immunological cause. The radiological abnormalities regressed spontaneously after cessation of treatment confirming the diagnosis of  drug-induced pneumonitis. CONCLUSION: Avelumab can induce interstitial lung disease. The mechanism is uncertain and requires further studies. Monitoring of respiratory function and CT scanning are necessary for its early management."

Durvalumab is an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 on T-cells, countering the tumor's immune-evading tactics. Phase I/II studies demonstrated durable responses and manageable tolerability in heavily pre-treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This phase II study is designed to administrate three durvalumab IV infusions (10mg/kg at day 1, 15, 29) before surgery, to patients with pathologically confirmed NSCLC, clinical stage IB (>4cm) or stage II, ≥18 years of age, WHO performans status 0-1, without selection on PD-L1 expression. Preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy are not permitted. The primary objective is feasibility of complete surgical resection. Major pathological response on surgical tissue, defined as 10% or less remaining tumor cells, will be a secondary objective. Additional secondary objectives include tolerance, adverse effects, delay between start of treatment and surgery, response rate (RECIST 1.1), metabolic response rate, postoperative adverse events, disease-free survival and overall survival. A rate of complete resection<85% (P0) is considered unacceptable. P1 hypothesis is of 95%, and with a study power of 90% and an alpha risk of 5% (two-steps Fleming's procedure), 81 patients are required.

Although PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are more effective than standard chemotherapy in lung cancer, clinicians are afraid to actively use them  because of hyperprogression and pseudoprogression. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with tumor response and serious outcomes. We retrospectively collected the medical records of 51 patients with advanced NSCLC who received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors between January 2016 and February 2018. The mean patient age was 63.9 years, and 72.5% (37/51) were male. Most (92.2%, 47/51) had received previous systemic treatment. The overall response rate was 21.6% (11/51). The response rate was significantly lower in patients with pleural or pericardial metastasis than in patients without pleural or pericardial metastasis (4.3% vs. 35.7%; P = 0.007). Patients with pleural or pericardial metastasis had a significantly higher rate of adverse events of any grade (91.3% vs. 50.0%; P = 0.002) and grade 3-5 adverse events (52.2% vs. 25.0%; P = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Pleural or pericardial metastasis is a significant factor affecting the efficacy and rate of adverse events in advanced NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Clinicians should pay attention to the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer patients with pleural or pericardial metastasis."

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is persistent or recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage as a result of drugs, autoimmune diseases, or infections. DAH with pseudoprogression during nivolumab administration has rarely been reported. Herein, we describe our experience with one such case. A 41-year-old woman exhibited bloody sputum and ground glass opacities in the lungs along with tumor growth during nivolumab therapy for multiple lung metastases of  malignant melanoma. We diagnosed DAH with pseudoprogression as a result of nivolumab and administered steroid therapy. The DAH subsequently improved and the tumor shrank. This case illustrates that nivolumab can cause DAH with pseudoprogression, which can be controlled by steroid therapy. Thus, if bloody sputum and ground glass opacities in the lungs are observed with tumor growth during nivolumab administration, steroid therapy should be considered to control  DAH with pseudoprogression."

This study comprised 137 patients with NSCLC. Tumors were stained with 22C3 or 28-8 antibodies. There was a significant correlation between the immunoreactivity rate of tumor tissues obtained using 22C3 and 28-8 clones. No statistical difference in immunoreactivity between archival and recent samples stained either with 22C3 or  28-8 antibodies was observed. The immunoreactivity rate achieved with 22C3 or 28-8 antibodies significantly correlated with tumor histological type and size, but not with specimen storage time, age, gender, smoking history, clinical stage, or lymph node metastasis.

Nivolumab, an inhibitor of PD-1/PD-L1, is reported to have potential efficacy for the treatment NSCLC. Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with advanced NSCLC. Methods: Online electronic databases were searched in June 2017, including: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials were included that compared nivolumab to chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with regard to oncological outcome profiles. Review Manager Version 5.3 software was used. Results: Three studies were included in this analysis, comprising 1,395 patients  with NSCLC, of whom 698 received nivolumab and 697 received chemotherapy without  nivolumab. The pooled hazard ratios for overall survival (OS) and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.57-1.03; P=0.08) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.64-1.20; P=0.41), respectively. The pooled odds ratio for overall response rate was 1.40 (95% CI: 0.66-2.96; P=0.39), indicating that no benefit with nivolumab was found for OS, PFS, or overall response rate. However, the odds ratio for treatment-related adverse events, grades 3 or 4, between the patients who received nivolumab and chemotherapy was 0.13 (95% CI: 0.09-0.17; P<0.00001).  For patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, no difference was observed in PFS (95% CI: 0.70-1.00; P=0.05) and OS benefit (95% CI: 0.34-1.15; P=0.13) between the groups. These data demonstrate no clinical survival benefit with nivolumab for NSCLC patients, even in a subpopulation of patients with levels of PD-L1>5%.  However, nivolumab had a more favorable safety profile than chemotherapy. Future  investigations are needed to determine whether the efficacy of nivolumab can be improved."

We found that the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor was associated with a 31% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR]=0.69; 95% CI 0.64-0.74; P<0.00001) for patients with melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In subgroup analyses, all the patients with PD-L1-positive tumors had overall survival (OS) benefits from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors regardless of PD-L1 expression  level, and a dose-effect relationship between the expression of PD-L1 and OS benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors was observed. There was an OS improvement for  patients with a smoking history (P<0.00001), but no OS benefit was observed for nonsmokers (P=0.28). In addition, first-line therapy had better OS than second-line or later treatment (P=0.02). No significant improvement of OS was observed (P=0.70) in patients aged ≥75 years. The relative treatment efficacy was similar according to sex (male vs female, P=0.60), performance status (0 vs ≥1, P=0.68), tumor histology (squamous NSCLC vs non-squamous NSCLC vs melanoma vs urothelial carcinoma vs head and neck carcinoma vs renal cell carcinoma, P=0.64), and treatment type (PD-1 inhibitor vs PD-L1 inhibitor, P=0.36). In conclusion, PD-L1-positive tumors, smoking history, and first-line treatment were potential factors for the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Patients with higher PD-L1 expression might achieve greater OS benefits. In addition, sex, performance status, tumor histology, and treatment type could not predict the efficacy of this therapy. In contrast, patients aged >75 years and nonsmokers might not get OS benefits from this treatment. These results may improve treatment strategies and patient selection for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors."

The three major MpM histological variants, epithelioid (E-MpMs), biphasic, and sarcomatoid MpMs (S-MpMs), are characterised by an increased aggressiveness and enhanced levels of EZH2 expression. To investigate the MpM immune contexture along the spectrum of MpM histotypes, an extended in situ analysis was performed on a series of 14 cases. Tumour-infiltrating immune cells and their functionality were assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and flow cytometry analysis. MpMs are featured by a  complex immune landscape modulated along the spectrum of MpM variants. Tumour-infiltrating T cells and evidence for pre-existing antitumour immunity are mainly confined to E-MpMs. However, Th1-related immunological features are progressively impaired in the more aggressive forms of E-MpMs and completely lost in S-MpM. Concomitantly, E-MpMs show also signs of active immune suppression, such as the occurrence of Tregs and Bregs and the expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules PD1 and PDL1. This study enriches the rising rationale for immunotherapy in MpM and points to the E-MpMs as the most immune-sensitive MpM histotypes, but it also suggests that synergistic interventions aimed at modifying the tumour microenvironment (TME) should be considered to make immunotherapy beneficial for these patients."

We report two cases of potential transformation during treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. Case presentations: Case 1, a 65-year-old man was diagnosed with stage IVa lung adenocarcinoma on pleural fluid cytology. He received six cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed, then maintained on pemetrexed. He had disease progression after nine cycles of pemetrexed and was switched to nivolumab. He progressed after five cycles of nivolumab. Core biopsy of the lung mass revealed SCLC. Case 2, a 68-year-old man was diagnosed with two primary NSCLCs and underwent resection. He had recurrence after several months and was treated with four cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab on clinical trial, with partial response. He was continued on pembrolizumab and had disease progression after 30  cycles. Biopsy of the new lesions showed SCLC. Discussion: Histologic transformation from NSCLC to SCLC can be explained by the  presence of a common cell precursor. Proposed molecular mechanisms include loss of RB1, TP53 mutations, and MYC amplification. The distinction between transformation and mixed histology tumors is challenging, especially when pathologic material used for the initial diagnosis is limited. The possibility of a second metachronous primary lung cancer cannot be excluded in our cases. Histologic transformation with PD-1 inhibitors could be under-recognized. Disease progression should prompt re-biopsy to uncover new histology and change in treatment. Future studies are needed to elucidate mechanisms and predictors of transformation."

In all, 12 RCTs with 5,989 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Our results showed that ICI combination therapy was significantly associated with the improvement of overall  response rate (ORR) (RR =1.44 [95% CI 1.19, 1.74], P=0.0002), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR =0.67 [95% CI 0.59, 0.77], P<0.00001), and OS (HR =0.81 [95% CI 0.70, 0.95], P=0.008) in lung cancer. In subgroup analyses, combination ICI therapy significantly prolonged OS in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (HR =0.80 [95% CI 0.73, 0.88], P<0.00001) but not in SCLC (HR =0.94 [95% CI 0.82, 1.08], P=0.40) patients. Data suggested that PD-1 inhibitors had higher efficacy  and safety profiles than PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors in combination ICI therapy for lung cancer patients. Furthermore, tolerability analysis revealed higher incidences of grade ≥3 AEs, fatigue, and increased transaminases from combination ICI therapy. In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that combination ICI therapy should be considered in clinical practice and future study designs for NSCLC patients. However, the current data do not support the large-scale clinical application of combination ICI therapy in SCLC patients."

Pleomorphic RMS histology is almost exclusive to adult patients and often resistant to chemotherapy. We report the case of a 19-year-old patient who presented with a metastatic chemoresistant pleomorphic RMS. Considering the poor prognosis and the few systemic therapeutic options, we decided to carry out a whole exome sequencing (WES) of the tumour and germline DNA. WES identified a germline variation (c.1863_1864insT) in the MLH1 gene corresponding to a pathogenic mutation: (p. Leu622Serfs*10), whereas the family history did not fit with classical criteria for Lynch syndrome. Loss-of-heterozygosity at MLH1 locus was found in the tumour. Immunohistochemistry showed loss of MLH1 and PMS2 nuclear expression in the tumour cells. In view of the mismatch repair defects and a high programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression (60% of tumour cells expressed PD-L1), we administrated an anti-PD-1 antibody to the patient. He achieved a rapid complete  response of the lung metastases, which appears sustained after a 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: This observation of an RMS revealing an unexpected Lynch syndrome underlines the overlap between tumorous and germline molecular genetics and emphasises the major impact of cancer genomic medicine in clinical practice for guiding treatment decision."

However, at least two distinct patterns of PD-L1 expression have been observed with potential biological and clinical relevance in NSCLC: expression on TC or on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs). We investigated the molecular and cellular characteristics associated with PD-L1 expression in these distinct cell compartments in 4,549 cases of NSCLC. PD-L1 expression on IC was more prevalent and likely reflected IFN-γ-induced adaptive regulation accompanied by increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and effector T cells. High PD-L1 expression on TC, however, reflected an epigenetic dysregulation of the PD-L1 gene and was associated with a distinct histology described by poor immune infiltration, sclerotic/desmoplastic stroma, and mesenchymal molecular features. Importantly, durable clinical responses to atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) were observed in patients with tumors expressing high PD-L1 levels on either TC alone [40% objective response rate (ORR)] or IC alone (22% ORR). Thus, PD-L1 expression on TC or IC can independently attenuate anticancer immunity and emphasizes the functional importance of IC in regulating the antitumor T cell response."

It is expressed ubiquitously in a  latent form that must be activated to function. Determination of where and how latent TGF-β (L-TGF-β) is activated in the tumor microenvironment could facilitate cell- and mechanism-specific approaches to immunotherapeutically target TGF-β. Binding of L-TGF-β to integrin αvβ8 results in activation of TGF-β. We engineered and used αvβ8 antibodies optimized for blocking or detection, which - respectively - inhibit tumor growth in syngeneic tumor models or sensitively and specifically detect β8 in human tumors. Inhibition of αvβ8 potentiates cytotoxic T cell responses and recruitment of immune cells to tumor centers - effects that are independent of PD-1/PD-L1. β8 is expressed on the cell surface at high levels by tumor cells, not immune cells, while the reverse is true of L-TGF-β, suggesting that tumor cell αvβ8 serves as a platform for activating cell-surface L-TGF-β presented by immune cells. Transcriptome analysis of tumor-associated lymphoid cells reveals macrophages as a key cell type responsive to β8 inhibition with major increases in chemokine and tumor-eliminating genes. High β8 expression in tumor cells is seen in 20%-80% of various cancers, which rarely coincides with high PD-L1 expression. These data suggest tumor cell αvβ8 is a PD-1/PD-L1-independent immunotherapeutic target."

This study was undertaken to evaluate the preclinical efficacy of BMS-986012, a novel, nonfucosylated, fully human IgG1 antibody that binds specifically to FucGM1.Experimental Design: The antitumor activity of BMS-986012  was evaluated in in vitro assays using SCLC cells and in mouse xenograft and syngeneic tumor models, with and without chemotherapeutic agents and checkpoint inhibitors.Results: BMS-986012 showed a high binding affinity for FcγRIIIa (CD16), which resulted in enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against FucGM1-expressing tumor cell lines. BMS-986012-mediated tumor cell killing was also observed in complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) assays. In several mouse SCLC models, BMS-986012 demonstrated efficacy and was well tolerated. In the DMS79 xenograft model, tumor regression was achieved with BMS-986012 doses of 0.3 mg/kg and greater; antitumor activity was enhanced when BMS-986012 was combined with standard-of-care cisplatin or etoposide. In a syngeneic model, tumors derived from a genetically engineered model of SCLC were treated with BMS-986012 or anti-FucGM1 with a mouse IgG2a Fc and their responses evaluated; when BMS-986012  was combined with anti-PD-1 or anti-CD137 antibody, therapeutic responses significantly improved.Single-agent BMS-986012 demonstrated robust antitumor activity, with the addition of chemotherapeutic or immunomodulatory agents further inhibiting SCLC growth in the same models. These preclinical data  supported evaluation of BMS-986012 in a phase I clinical trial of patients with relapsed, refractory SCLC."

All fracture patients had vertebral compression, and two of the three had multiple fracture sites involved. Sites of  resorptive lesions included the shoulder, hand and clavicle. Biochemically, elevated or high-normal markers of bone resorption were seen in five of the six patients. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated in three of the four patients where checked. This case series represents the first description of potential skeletal adverse effects related to immune checkpoint inhibitors. These findings  are important for providers caring for patients who experience musculoskeletal symptoms and may merit additional evaluation."

However, PD-1 inhibitors can lead to immune-related adverse events , including pneumonitis, which is typically mild, but can be severe and potentially fatal. Pneumonitis often resolves with steroids, but some cases are steroid refractory,  leading to a relapsing and remitting course in milder cases or the need for salvage therapies in more severe cases. Here, we present two patients with NSCLC  who developed severe pneumonitis following therapy with nivolumab and pembrolizumab. While one patient improved with steroids and infliximab, the other patient failed to respond to steroids and subsequently died. These cases demonstrate the highly variable presentation and therapeutic responses seen in patients with pneumonitis following anti-PD-1 therapy and illustrate that severe  cases can often present refractory to steroid therapy."

However, no study has systematically evaluated the maximum duration that the antibody persists on T cells or the association between this duration and residual therapeutic efficacy or potential adverse events. To define the duration of binding and residual efficacy of nivolumab after discontinuation, we developed a simplified strategy for T cell monitoring and used it to analyze T cells from peripheral blood from 11 non-small cell lung  cancer patients previously treated with nivolumab. To determine the suitability of our method for other applications, we compared transcriptome profiles between  nivolumab-bound and nivolumab-unbound CD8 T cells. We also applied T cell monitoring in 2 nivolumab-treated patients who developed progressive lung tumors  during long-term follow-up. Prolonged nivolumab binding was detected more than 20 weeks after the last infusion, regardless of the total number of nivolumab infusions (2-15 doses) or type of subsequent treatment, in 9 of the 11 cases in which long-term monitoring was possible. Ki-67 positivity, a proliferation marker, in T cells decreased in patients with progressive disease. Transcriptome profiling identified the signals regulating activation of nivolumab-bound T cells, which may contribute to nivolumab resistance. In 2 patients who restarted nivolumab, T  cell proliferation markers exhibited the opposite trend and correlated with clinical response. Although only a few samples were analyzed, our strategy of monitoring both nivolumab binding and Ki-67 in T cells might help determine residual efficacy under various types of concurrent or subsequent treatment.

However, the duration for which ICIs should be continued remains a clinical problem. We examined the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors after the discontinuation of antibodies due to adverse events (AEs) in patients with NSCLC. This was a multicenter retrospective study that analyzed NSCLC patients who were  treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors by August 2016. The patients with NSCLC were 18 males and 1 female at a median 67 years  of age (range: 49-80 years). Eighteen of 19 patients were treated with nivolumab, one was with atezolizumab. Approximately half of AEs were interstitial pneumonia. Fourteen patients (73.7%) were treated with steroid therapy. The median number of treatment cycles was 7 (range, 1-70), and the median duration of treatment was 2.8 months (range, 1 day-32.9 months). The overall response rate with confirmation during treatment was 21.1%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.2-17.1 months) and 5.6 months (95% CI = 0-12.2 months) from the initiation and the discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, respectively. The median PFS after discontinuation according to the confirmed response during administration was not reached for partial response (PR) and 4.9 months (95% CI, 3.7-6.0) for stable disease (SD) patients (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The PFS of the PR patients was completely different from that of the  SD patients.

One of the main mechanisms for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)  to induce T cell tolerance is through secretion of reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which nitrates tyrosine residues in proteins involved in T cell function.  However, so far very few nitrated proteins have been identified. Here, using a transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer and a syngeneic cell line model of lung cancer, we applied a nitroproteomic approach based on chemical derivation of 3-nitrotyrosine and identified that lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), an initiating tyrosine kinase in the T cell receptor signaling cascade, is nitrated at Tyr394 by MDSCs. LCK nitration inhibits T cell activation, leading to reduced interleukin 2 (IL2) production and proliferation. In human T cells with defective endogenous LCK, wild type, but not nitrated LCK, rescues IL2 production. In the mouse model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by  prostate-specific deletion of Pten, p53, and Smad4, CRPC is resistant to an ICB therapy composed of antiprogrammed cell death 1 (PD1) and anticytotoxic-T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) antibodies. However, we showed that ICB elicits strong anti-CRPC efficacy when combined with an RNS neutralizing agent. Together, these data identify a previously unknown mechanism of T cell inactivation by MDSC-induced protein nitration and illuminate a clinical path hypothesis for combining ICB with RNS-reducing agents in the treatment of CRPC."

People have greatly anticipated the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1  monoclonal antibody in lung cancer treatment but anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment failed to positively affect these patients. The NCCN guidelines do not recommend immunotherapy to patients with NSCLC carrying EGFR mutation at present. However,  the reason why EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients show poor response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment is still unknown. Immune suppression and tolerance are  the main characteristics of tumor. The PD-1/PD-L1 co-inhibitory molecule is probably not the main escape route of this tumor type. The main characteristic of EGFR-mutant lung cancer is the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway. EGFR activation is likely responsible for the uninflamed tumor microenvironment of this type tumor and particiaptes in immunosuppression and immune escape. Accumulating evidence proved that activation of EGFR signaling pathway is essential to the generation of Treg and tolerogenic DCs. In this review, we summarize the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibiodies in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients; provide evidence to analyze the potential reason why these patients cannot benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, and explore the strategy that shoud be adopted in the future."

The chronic inflammation associated with COPD probably promotes the earliest stages of carcinogenesis. However, once tumors have progressed to malignancy, the impact of COPD on the tumor immune microenvironment remains poorly defined, and its effects on immune-checkpoint blockers' efficacy are still unknown. To study the impact of COPD on the immune contexture of non-small cell lung cancer. We performed in-depth immune profiling of lung tumors by immunohistochemistry and we determined its impact on patient survival (n = 435).  Tumor-infiltrating T lymphocyte (TIL) exhaustion by flow cytometry (n = 50) was also investigated. The effectiveness of an anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death-1) treatment (nivolumab) was evaluated in 39 patients with advanced-stage non-small  cell lung cancer. All data were analyzed according to patient COPD status. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN Remarkably, COPD severity is positively correlated with the coexpression of PD-1/TIM-3 (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule-3) by CD8 T cells. In agreement, we observed a loss of CD8 T cell-associated favorable clinical outcome in COPD+ patients. Interestingly, a negative prognostic value of PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) expression by tumor cells was observed only in highly CD8 T cell-infiltrated tumors of COPD+ patients. Finally, data obtained on 39 patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer treated by an anti-PD-1 antibody showed longer progression-free survival in COPD+ patients, and also that the association between the severity of smoking and the response to nivolumab was preferentially  observed in COPD+ patients. COPD is associated with an increased sensitivity of CD8 tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes to immune escape mechanisms developed by tumors, thus suggesting a higher sensitivity to PD-1 blockade in patients with COPD."

Durable responses to MET inhibitors are observed in patients with advanced MET exon 14-altered lung cancers in prospective trials. In contrast, the activity of immunotherapy, PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden (TMB) of these tumors and are not well characterized. Patients and methods: Patients with MET exon 14-altered lung cancers of any stage treated at two academic institutions were identified. A review of clinicopathologic and molecular features, and an analysis of response to single-agent or combination immune checkpoint inhibition were conducted. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry was carried out and TMB was calculated by estimation from targeted next-generation sequencing panels. Results: We identified 147 patients with MET exon 14-altered lung cancers. PD-L1  expression of 0%, 1%-49%, and ≥50% were 37%, 22%, and 41%, respectively, in 111 evaluable tumor samples. The median TMB of MET exon 14-altered lung cancers was lower than that of unselected non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in both independently evaluated cohorts: 3.8 versus 5.7 mutations/megabase (P < 0.001, n = 78 versus 1769, cohort A), and 7.3 versus 11.8 mutations/megabase (P < 0.001, n = 62 versus 1100, cohort B). There was no association between PD-L1 expression  and TMB (Spearman's rho=0.18, P = 0.069). In response-evaluable patients (n = 24), the objective response rate was 17% (95% CI 6% to 36%) and the median progression-free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI 1.7-2.7).

As predictive aspect of CD8 and PD-L1, we used 85 NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1. Two validation cohorts were used including 44 NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1 and an external cohort with different tumor types. In prognostic cohorts, high CD8A expression was associated with longer OS (p = 0.02), while high CD274 mRNA was associated with poor prognosis (p = 0.05). In predictive cohort, high CD8 expression and CD8A mRNA were associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.0002). There was no significant association between PD-L1 expression and PFS while high CD274 mRNA was associated with longer PFS (p = 0.009). A combination of CD8A and CD274 was highly predictive of outcome. These results were confirmed in the validation cohorts. This two-genes signature demonstrated similar results compared to gold standard signatures. CONCLUSION: CD8 represents both a prognostic and predictive factor of outcomes, while PD-L1 share different prognostic and predictive roles."

Although recent advances in targeted therapy have shown great promise, effective  targeting of KRAS remains elusive, and concurrent alterations in tumor suppressors render KRAS-mutant tumors even more resistant to existing therapies.  Contributing to the refractoriness of KRAS-mutant tumors are immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as increased presence of suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) in tumors and elevated expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating T cells. Treatment with BET bromodomain inhibitors is beneficial for hematologic malignancies, and they have Treg-disruptive effects in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model. Targeting PD-1-inhibitory signals through PD-1 antibody blockade also has substantial therapeutic impact in lung cancer, although these outcomes are limited to a minority of patients. We hypothesized that the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 would synergize with PD-1 blockade to promote a robust antitumor response in lung cancer. In the present study, using Kras+/LSL-G12D ; Trp53L/L (KP) mouse models of NSCLC, we identified  cooperative effects between JQ1 and PD-1 antibody. The numbers of tumor-infiltrating Tregs were reduced and activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells, which had a T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine profile, was enhanced, underlying their improved effector function. Furthermore, lung tumor-bearing mice treated with this combination showed robust and long-lasting antitumor responses  compared with either agent alone, culminating in substantial improvement in the overall survival of treated mice. Thus, combining BET bromodomain inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade offers a promising therapeutic approach for solid malignancies such as lung adenocarcinoma."

Two modalities in particular, bi-specific antibodies for T-cell  redirection and activation (BiTe) and immune-mobilizing monoclonal T-cell receptors against cancer (ImmTAC), are being evaluated in efficacy studies as 'off-the-shelf' reagents. Optimal therapy will require an understanding and means to address regulatory mechanisms of limiting efficacy. In light of this, we evaluated the impact of induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells on the efficacy of tumour cell killing redirected by ImmTAC and demonstrated down-regulation of T-cell proliferation and expression of CD25, CD107a, Granzyme B and Perforin by ImmTAC-redirected T cells. Significant recovery of ImmTAC potency, however, could be achieved when combined with an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, we found that among lung cancer patients failing to respond to ImmTAC therapy, there was a significantly higher fraction of Treg cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of lung cancer patients than in healthy donors. These results provide in vitro evidence for an iTreg cell-mediated immunosuppression of ImmTAC-redirected T-cell responses. Whilst immune checkpoint blockade can reverse the Treg cell suppression, it forms a rational basis for a combination of the blockade with ImmTAC in clinical trials."

In the present study, we evaluated a novel triple combination therapy consisting of local radiotherapy, intratumoral CpG, and systemic PD-1 blockade in lung cancer models. The efficacy of a novel triple therapy was examined by recording tumor volume and survival time. The immunologic effects of this novel triple therapy were evaluated by the frequency and percentage of immune cells and cytokines using flow cytometry. This triple combination proved more effective than its subcomponents and its positive antitumor effects included reducing tumor growth and improving host  survival. The antitumor effect was not only observed in directly irradiated tumors but also in at distant tumor sites in a CD8+ T-cell-dependent fashion. Phenotypic analyses of CD8+ T cells revealed that the triple combination therapy  increased the percentage of effector memory T cells in the spleen. Furthermore, the combination therapy significantly increased the frequency of IFN-γ and TNF-α-positive-CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and mature-activated dendritic cells (DCs) within treated tumors, indicating that the antitumor effects likely depend on the activation of a DC subset specialized in antigen crosspriming to induce cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTLs). In addition, the triple therapy reduced immunosuppressive factors, like regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the spleen and tumor microenvironment while inducing the robust systemic antitumor effect. Finally, the triple treatment was, indeed, well tolerated and had a little effect on the hemogram and lung. These results suggest that this triple therapy promotes a local antitumor immune response with systemic consequences. The efficacy and limited toxicity of this strategy are attractive for clinical translation."

We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to state the safety profile of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in NSCLC, and identify the exact incidence and relative risk (RR) of both summary and detailed AEs. Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane library databases) and major conference proceedings were systematically searched  for all clinical trials in lung cancer using PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with chemotherapy in NSCLC patients reporting all-grade (1-4) or high-grade (3-4) AEs [toxic symptoms, hematologic toxicities, and immune-related  AEs (irAEs)], treatment discontinuation due to toxicities, or toxic deaths. The pooled incidence, RR, and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of toxicity  outcomes were calculated. A total of 4413 patients from 8 RCTs (3 with nivolumab; 2 with atezolizumab, and 3 with pembrolizuma) were included. In terms of summary toxic events, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had a significantly lower risk of any all-grade AEs (66.20 vs. 86.08%; RR 0.77) and high-grade AEs (14.26 vs. 43.53%; RR 0.32), treatment discontinuation (5.94 vs. 13.92%; RR 0.44), and toxic deaths (0.48 vs.  1.12%; RR 0.45) than chemotherapy. With regard to detailed toxic events, the risk of toxic symptoms (including all-grade fatigue, nausea, constipation, diarrhea and peripheral sensory neuropathy; high-grade fatigue, anorexia, diarrhea and peripheral sensory neuropathy) and hematologic toxicities (including all-grade and high-grade neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors was significantly lower than from chemotherapy. However, there was a small but significantly increased risk of irAEs, including all-grade rash, pruritus, colitis, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, ALT/AST elevations and pneumonitis, as well as high-grade pneumonitis. CONCLUSION: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are generally safer and better tolerated than chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC with regard to summary toxic events, detailed toxic symptoms and hematologic toxicities. However, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors can generate a unique spectrum of irAEs, and several of them can be severe and even life-threatening. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of these AEs, as they may have a potentially negative impact on the patients' quality of life and survival outcome."

By high-dimensional single  cell analysis of millions of CD8+ T cells from 53 individuals with lung cancer, we defined those subsets that are enriched in tumors compared with cancer-free tissues and blood. Besides exhausted and activated cells, we identified CXCR5+ TIM-3- CD8+ T cells with a partial exhausted phenotype, while retaining gene networks responsible for stem-like plasticity and cytotoxicity, as revealed by single cell sequencing of the whole transcriptome. Ex vivo, CXCR5+ TIM-3- CD8+ T  cells displayed enhanced self-renewal and multipotency compared with more differentiated subsets and were largely polyfunctional. Analysis of inhibitory and costimulatory receptors revealed PD-1, TIGIT, and CD27 as possible targets of immunotherapy. We thus demonstrate a hierarchy of differentiation in the context  of T cell exhaustion in human cancer similar to that of chronically infected mice, which is further shown to disappear with disease progression."

A high TMB (TMB-H) tumor is defined as one with high somatic mutational rates, which correlates with clinical responses to certain treatments such as immunotherapies. We determined TMB in lung adenocarcinoma and clarified the characteristics of patients with TMB-H in relation to common driver mutations and smoking history. Genomic aberrations and TMB were determined in Japanese patients with lung adenocarcinoma (n = 100) using next-generation sequencing of 415 known cancer genes. TMB-H was defined as > 20 mutations per megabase (Mb) of  sequenced DNA. The median TMB was 13.5 (5-33) mutations/Mb. Ten of 100 (10%) patients showed TMB-H, and the others showed low TMB (TMB-L). Only two of 10 (20%) patients with TMB-H had one of the common driver mutations (ALK and ERBB2 mutation), whereas 57 of 90 (63%) patients with TMB-L had one of the driver mutations, including ALK, EGFR, ERBB2, ROS, RET, and MET (P < 0.05). Notably, no  EGFR mutation was observed in patients with TMB-H. Eight of 10 (80%) patients with TMB-H had recent smoking history, whereas only 17 of 90 (19%) patients with  TMB-L had recent smoking history (P < 0.001). We found that TMB-H is associated with smoking history, whereas TMB-L is associated with the common driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma, which may impact treatment strategies for these patients."

However, a substantial percentage of patients do not respond to this treatment. We examined the use of DNA methylation profiles to determine the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in patients recruited with current stage IV NSCLC. In this multicentre study, we recruited adult patients from 15 hospitals in France, Spain, and Italy who had histologically proven stage IV NSCLC and had  been exposed to PD-1 blockade during the course of the disease. The study structure comprised a discovery cohort to assess the correlation between epigenetic features and clinical benefit with PD-1 blockade and two validation cohorts to assess the validity of our assumptions. We first established an epigenomic profile based on a microarray DNA methylation signature (EPIMMUNE) in  a discovery set of tumour samples from patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The EPIMMUNE signature was validated in an independent set of patients. A derived DNA methylation marker was validated by a single-methylation  assay in a validation cohort of patients. The main study outcomes were progression-free survival and overall survival. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate progression-free and overall survival, and calculated the differences between the groups with the log-rank test. We constructed a multivariate Cox model to identify the variables independently associated with progression-free and overall survival. FINDINGS: Between June 23, 2014, and May 18, 2017, we obtained samples from 142 patients: 34 in the discovery cohort, 47 in the EPIMMUNE validation cohort, and 61 in the derived methylation marker cohort (the T-cell differentiation factor forkhead box P1 [FOXP1]). The EPIMMUNE signature in patients with stage IV NSCLC  treated with anti-PD-1 agents was associated with improved progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0·010, 95% CI 3·29 × 10-4-0·0282; p=0·0067) and overall survival (0·080, 0·017-0·373; p=0·0012). The EPIMMUNE-positive signature  was not associated with PD-L1 expression, the presence of CD8+ cells, or mutational load. EPIMMUNE-negative tumours were enriched in tumour-associated macrophages and neutrophils, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and senescent endothelial cells. The EPIMMUNE-positive signature was associated with improved progression-free survival in the EPIMMUNE validation cohort (0·330, 0·149-0·727;  p=0·0064). The unmethylated status of FOXP1 was associated with improved progression-free survival (0·415, 0·209-0·802; p=0·0063) and overall survival (0·409, 0·220-0·780; p=0·0094) in the FOXP1 validation cohort. The EPIMMUNE signature and unmethylated FOXP1 were not associated with clinical benefit in lung tumours that did not receive immunotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that the epigenetic milieu of NSCLC tumours indicates which patients are most likely to benefit from nivolumab or pembrolizumab treatments. The methylation status of FOXP1 could be associated with validated predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1 staining and mutational load to better select patients who will experience clinical benefit with PD-1 blockade, and its predictive value should be evaluated in prospective studies.

We assessed cost-effectiveness of anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC. We retrieved survival, progression, and safety data comparing first-line pembrolizumab to platinum-doublets for advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50%, non-mutated EGFR, and non-translocated ALK, from KEYNOTE-024. Published United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) costs informed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Our analysis was based on a Bayesian Markov model of disease with full lifetime horizon. We estimated costs in USD and summarized effectiveness as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Patients treated with pembrolizumab accumulated 1.80 QALYs (95% CrI 1.56-1.89), for moderate dependency between outcomes, compared to 1.06 QALYs (0.94-1.13) with chemotherapy. From a British National Health System (NHS) perspective, the ICER was $52k ($43k-$69k) per end-of-life (EoL) adjusted QALY gained, above the 42k USD threshold, while from a US cost perspective, the ICER was $49k ($40k-67k) per EoL adjusted QALY, below the hypothetical 100k USD threshold. Evidence suggests first-line pembrolizumab for NSCLC may be cost-effective in the US but not the UK, in spite of very similar ICER values in  both countries."

However, identification of patients who are likely to respond to nivolumab remains difficult at present. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 87 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC seen in clinical practice who received nivolumab monotherapy at the National Cancer Center Hospital in Japan between January 2016 and July 2016 (discovery cohort). In addition, we also collected the clinical data of 75 patients who were administered nivolumab monotherapy between August 2016 and March 2017 (validation cohort). For this study, we focused on the changes in the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) observed after nivolumab monotherapy. In the discovery cohort, increase (≥10%) of the LMR at 4 weeks after the start of nivolumab monotherapy relative to the pretreatment LMR was positively correlated with an objective response (objective response rate (ORR); 39.4% vs 11.8%, p = 0.0065). When this cutoff value of ≥10% was used, increase of the LMR  was significantly associated with a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS [mPFS]; 7.3 months vs 2.5 months, p = 0.0049) and overall survival (OS) (median survival time; 15.6 months vs 8.9 months, p = 0.014). In the validation cohort also, increase of the LMR was significantly associated with higher ORR (50.0% vs 20.0%, p = 0.015) and prolonged PFS (mPFS; not reached vs 3.1 months, p = 0.0092). On the other hand, no such correlation was observed among patients treated with docetaxel. CONCLUSION: A rapid increase of the LMR was significantly associated with the effects of nivolumab monotherapy in our study cohort. Therefore, early change of  the LMR may be used as a novel effective surrogate marker to decide on continuation of anti-PD-1 therapy."

Consecutive patients with NSCLC and RTDs (non-EGFR/ALK, n-82) were selected from the Davidoff Cancer Center database. ORR, PFS, OS with ICPi, OS since advanced disease diagnosis, TMB, MSI, and PD-L1 expression were analyzed; uni- and multivariate PFS and OS analyses were done. OS with ICPi was compared between the RTD cohort and the non-selected NSCLC cohort (n-278). Of 50 tumors tested, 32%, 38%, and 30% were associated with ≥50%, 1-49%  and <1% PD-L1 expression, respectively. Median TMB (n-48) comprised 4 muts/Mb (0-57); TMB ≥ 10 muts/Mb was seen in 19% of tumors. Both TMB and PD-L1 expression varied across different RTDs. All the 47 tumors were MSI stable. ORR with ICPi (n-44) was 16%, median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.6-5.0), median OS was 16.2 months (95% CI, 8.4-NR). No correlation was seen between OS with ICPi and PD-L1 expression (p > 0.4), TMB (p > 0.8), or RTD type (p > 0.3). In the multivariate analysis, ECOG PS (p-0.005), targeted agents exposure (p-0.005), and ICPi exposure (p-0.04) were the only variables which correlated with OS since advanced disease diagnosis. Median OS since advanced disease diagnosis comprised 32 months (95% CI, 19.9-44.9) and 13 months (95% CI, 6.6-15.9) for patients who were and were not exposed to ICPi, respectively (log-rank test-6.3; p-0.01). In the inter-cohort comparison, for patients matched for ECOG PS (0/1), median OS with ICPi comprised 17.5 months (95% CI, 8.1-NR) and 8.6 months (95% CI, 6.7-NR) for RTD and non-selected patients, respectively (log-rank test-2.4, p-0.1). CONCLUSION: In NSCLC with RTD, ICPi have favorable efficacy and independent impact on OS. NSCLC with RTD is associated with MSI stable status and variable levels of PD-L1 expression and TMB; their predictive value remains to be determined."

It is also administered to individuals with disease progression during or after platinum-based chemotherapy, without a need to determine the level of PD-L1 expression in the tumor. The present study aimed  to evaluate the survival and efficacy of Nivolumab treatment. A retrospective analysis was performed at a thoracic oncology service in a tertiary referral center (Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center), on patients with NSCLC (squamous and non-squamous). All patients were treated with Nivolumab 3 mg/kg, administered intravenously every 2 weeks as part of a compassionate use program. The survival  data was analyzed after 22 months. The overall survival (OS) was 34.9%, while the progression free survival (PFS) was 19.3%. The median PFS from the first dose of  Nivolumab to treatment discontinuation was 4 months. A response assessment was performed in the 62 patients who received at least four cycles of Nivolumab, out  of the 77 patient cohort. There was a complete response in 1 patient, a partial response in 11 patients, stable disease in 25 patients and progressive disease in 25 patients. The observed response rate of Nivolumab as a service treatment in unselected patients with unknown PD-L1 status NSCLC was 19%. The disease control  rate was 60%. In the present study Nivolumab was given to a cohort of patients representing those seen in daily clinical practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Survival and efficacy results strongly support the continued use of Nivolumab as a treatment for NSCLC."

Here, we studied the ability of transplanted human  cancer cells to form primary tumors and metastasize in humanized immune system (HIS) mice created by transfer of CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells. All tested transplanted cancer cell lines developed primary tumors that progressed nearly synchronously. Spontaneous lung and liver metastases developed from both orthotopic and ectopic transplanted cancer cells, and the ability to spread inversely correlated with the extent of CD8+ infiltration in the primary tumor. Further analysis revealed that interactions between the cancer model and the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes created tumor microenvironments (TMEs) resembling  clinical cancers. Some models were largely immune cell-excluding, while others appeared to develop adaptive resistance to immune-mediated destruction by increased expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) and recruitment of human regulatory T cells. Our data suggest that HIS mice may provide a promising in vivo tumor model for evaluating immune modulatory anticancer therapies. Moreover, our study identified different tumor models resembling specific types of human TMEs, rendering each beneficial for addressing disease-specific issues."

PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has emerged as the most commonly used clinical biomarker of response and overall tumor mutational burden (TMB) is being explored as a clinical biomarker. However, both are hampered by being imperfect predictors of response and both can be dynamic during the course of illness. In this review, we will discuss the development of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker as well as the ongoing emergence of other genomic and proteomic markers that can help refine our use of immunotherapies to maximize benefit in the most patients."

This retrospective case series was designed to investigate objective response and survival rates of salvage chemotherapy following nivolumab and explore the immunohistochemical profiles of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. The medical records of 37 patients administered nivolumab were retrospectively reviewed. Overall response rate and progression-free survival were compared among three groups: salvage chemotherapy following nivolumab, nivolumab therapy alone, and chemotherapy preceding nivolumab. Eight cases met the study criteria. Salvage chemotherapy following nivolumab improved the overall response rate to 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.4-90.6%; P = 0.004) and median progression-free survival to six months (95% CI 4.6-7.4; P = 0.016), compared to nivolumab alone and preceding chemotherapy. The response to salvage chemotherapy was not associated with tumor  PD-L1 expression. A partial response was achieved in four cases with ≤ 5% and ≤ 2.9 cells/mm2 of PD-1+ immune cells, whereas stable disease and progressive disease were observed in three cases with ≥ 30% and ≥ 12.7 cells/mm2 . Responders had fewer PD-1+ immune cells than non-responders (percentage P = 0.028; density P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Salvage chemotherapy following nivolumab improved anti-tumor activity regardless of tumor PD-L1 status, but nivolumab following chemotherapy did not. The presence of few PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells may serve as a potential predictor of response to salvage chemotherapy. Further studies involving a large cohort are needed to clarify how nivolumab re-sensitizes the tumor immune microenvironment to chemotherapy."

Effective immune responses to these infections require precise immune regulation to preserve lung function after viral clearance. One component of airway pathophysiology and lung injury associated with acute respiratory virus infection is effector T cells, yet these are the primary cells required for viral clearance. Accordingly, multiple immune mechanisms exist to regulate effector T cells, limiting immunopathology while permitting clearance of infection. Much has been learned in recent years about regulation of T cell function during chronic infection and cancer, and it is now clear that many of these mechanisms also control inflammation in acute lung infection. In this review, we focus on regulatory T cells, inhibitory receptors, and other cells and molecules that regulate cell-mediated immunity in the context of acute respiratory virus infection."

Increasing knowledge regarding the presence of a CNS lymphatic system and the physical and biochemical alteration of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by the tumor microenvironment suggests immune cell trafficking in and out of the CNS is possible. Emerging clinical data suggest immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can stimulate T cells peripherally to in turn have anti-tumor effects in the CNS. For example, anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monotherapy with pembrolizumab has shown intracranial response rates of 20-30% in patients with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab [anti-PD-1 and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)] showed  an intracranial response rate of 55% in patients with melanoma brain metastases.  More data are needed to confirm these response rates and to determine mechanisms  of efficacy and resistance. While local therapies such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), and surgery remain current mainstays, ICIS offer potential decreased neurotoxicity.

Herein, we report the unusual case of inflammatory arthritis induced  by anti-PD-1 agent pembrolizumab. Case report: A 55-years old male was treated with pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks for a metastatic hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Following two cycles of immunotherapy, and while complete response of lung metastases was achieved, the patient presented with stiffness, swelling and pain of the right knee. Clinical examination and synovial fluid analysis revealed a seronegative inflammatory arthritis. Pembrolizumab therapy was interrupted and low-dose prednisone was administered with remarkable  clinical improvement. Pembrolizumab was reintroduced, but after the fifth cycle,  the patient developed inflammatory polyarthritis involving both knees and interphalangeal joints of both hands resulting in severe clinical deterioration.  At that time, treatment with pembrolizumab was permanently discontinued. High-dose prednisone and methotrexate treatment led to remission of clinical symptoms. Pembrolizumab-induced inflammatory arthritis is an unusual  rheumatic immune-related adverse event that physicians are likely to encounter as ICI use expands. Multidisciplinary management and rheumatology consultation are necessary to provide immediate treatment and avoid permanent joint damage."

However, recent studies reveal important roles of lncRNAs in regulating cancer-related pathways.  Human antisense lncRNA-NKX2-1-AS1 partially overlaps the NKX2-1/TTF1 gene within  chromosomal region 14q13.3. Amplification of this region and/or differential expression of genes therein are associated with cancer progression. Herein we show higher levels of NKX2-AS1 and NKX2-1 in lung adenocarcinomas relative to non-tumor controls but no correlation between NKX2-1-AS1 and NKX2-1 levels across specimens, or with amplification of the 14q13.3 region, suggesting that NKX2-1-AS1 and NKX2-1 are independently regulated. Loss-and-gain of function experiments showed that NKX2-1-AS1 does not regulate NKX2-1 expression, or nearby genes, but controls genes in trans. Genes up-regulated by NKX2-1-AS1-knockdown belong to cell adhesion and PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint pathways. NKX2-1-AS1 negatively regulates endogenous CD274/PD-L1, a known target of NKX2-1, and the transcriptional activity of -1kb-CD274 promoter-reporter construct. Furthermore,  NKX2-1-AS1 interferes with NKX2-1 protein binding to the CD274-promoter, likely by NKX2-1 protein-NKX2-1-AS1 interactions. Finally, NKX2-1-AS1 negatively regulates cell migration and wound healing, but not proliferation or apoptosis. These findings support potential roles of NKX2-1-AS1 in limiting motility and immune system evasion of lung carcinoma cells, highlighting a novel mechanism that may influence tumorigenic capabilities of lung epithelial cells."

Drugs that  target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib, icotinib, and osimertinib) are among the most commonly used targeted therapies. Afatinib is an irreversible second-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), and the LUX-Lung 3 trial demonstrated the superiority of afatinib to cisplatin and pemetrexed in the frontline treatment of treatment-naïve patients with advanced EGFR mutation adenocarcinoma of the lung.  Although these drugs show significant therapeutic efficacy, most patients invariably experience disease progression resulting in death. Immunotherapy targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has now been approved for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. These can produce sustained clinical responses by reversing negative regulators of T-cell function; however, immunotherapy response rates remain low, and only a few patients ultimately benefit from this approach. Here, we discuss the potential of EGFR-TKIs for inducing antitumor immunity and the feasibility of their combination with immunotherapy (including PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) in NSCLC patients and the associated challenges for clinical application."

Methods: The methodology was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) and the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Results: Our research included five randomized-controlled trials involving 3,025  patients. We compared anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab) with docetaxel in pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 0.69 (95%CI: 0.63-0.75, P<0.0001, and Ph=0.67) and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.81-0.94, P=0.0004, and Ph=0.11), respectively. Meanwhile, the pooled risk ratio (RR) for objective response rate (ORR) was 1.53  (95% CI: 1.16-2.01, P=0.003, and Ph=0.03) in all patients. Subgroup analyses showed that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment significantly improved OS in patients with  PD-L1 expression at any level, even in patients with PD-L1<1%. The RR for occurrence of grades 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse effects was 0.23 (95% CI: 0.15-0.36, and P<0.001). OS, PFS, and ORR were significantly more improved for patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies than for those treated with docetaxel. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy resulted in longer OS than docetaxel, regardless of PD-L1 expression; however, higher PD-L1 levels were likely to correlate with better outcome. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies also had a better safety profile than docetaxel."

Although surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for patients with localized disease, disease recurrence is common and 5-year overall survival is poor (~ 65%). Both radiation therapy and conventional chemotherapy are used to reduce  local and distant recurrence. However, the utility of radiation therapy is often  limited by disease location (in the case of retroperitoneal sarcomas, for instance) while systemic therapy with conventional lines of chemotherapy offer limited efficacy and are often poorly tolerated and associated with significant toxicity. Within the past decade, major advances have been made in the treatment  of other malignancies including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung carcinoma with the advent of immune-checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4), pembrolizumab (anti-PD1), and nivolumab (anti-PD1). The  recently published SARC028 (NCT02301039), an open label, phase II, multicenter trial of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced bone and soft tissue sarcomas reported promising activity in select histologic subtypes of advanced STS, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. There is a clear need for novel and effective adjuncts in the treatment  of STS. We hypothesize that immune checkpoint blockade will be effective in patients with surgically resectable primary or locally recurrent dedifferentiated liposarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma when administered in the neoadjuvant setting. The primary aim of this phase II, single-center, open label, randomized non-comparative trial is to determine the pathologic response to neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy and combination nivolumab/ipilimumab in patients with resectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the retroperitoneum or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the trunk or extremity treated with concurrent standard of care neoadjuvant radiation therapy. DISCUSSION: This study will help define the role of single agent anti-PD1 and combination anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 therapy in patients with surgically resectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

We successfully treated our first patient with systemic and topical steroids, photoprotection and hydroxychloroquine.

Our second patient presented with a protracted course of a cutaneous eruption in spite of discontinuation of anti-PD-1 therapy and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and infliximab. This patient's SCLE resolved after the addition of topical steroids and photoprotection and discontinuation of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy. She and her oncology team decided to pursue non-PD-1 inhibitor treatment for lung cancer owing to a lack of tumour response. We add SCLE and dermatomyositis to the growing list of autoimmune complications of PD-1 blockade. Our cases raise a number of questions, particularly in relation to the viability of continuing anti-PD-1 therapy after developing SCLE and the role of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with PD-1 inhibitor-associated connective tissue disease."

Nivolumab, a human IgG4 programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, blocks T cells activation preventing signal and allows the immune system to clear cancer cells. Nivolumab was approved in the second-line therapy in squamous cell lung cancer by FDA, with less than 10% unusual skin reaction, like sensory neuropathy, peeling skin, erythema multiforme, vitiligo, and psoriasis. Radiotherapy could aggravate this skin reaction through inflammatory response and promotion of immunity. The combined treatment of anti-PD-1 and radiotherapy represented a new promising therapeutic approach in many studies, but the risk of side effects may be high. We reported a patient with advanced squamous cell lung cancer who suffered from serious skin immune-related adverse events when he was treated with nivolumab and radiotherapy. The immune overreaction of the treatment of anti-PD-1 treatment and radiotherapy might cause these serious skin adverse events.

To address this obstacle, we investigated combinations of anti-GITR, anti-PD1 and radiation therapy (XRT) in our previously developed anti-PD1 resistant 344SQ non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma preclinical tumor model. We hypothesized that targeting multiple mechanisms of immune evasion with this triple therapy would lead to an enhanced tumor-specific immune response and improve survival more so than any mono- or dual therapy. In a two tumor 344SQR murine model, treatment with anti-GITR, anti-PD1, and XRT led to significantly improved survival and an abscopal response, with half of the mice becoming tumor free. These mice showed durable response and increased CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory on tumor rechallenge. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressed the highest level of GITR at the tumor site  and anti-GITR therapy drastically diminished Tregs at the tumor site. Anti-tumor  effects were largely dependent on CD4+ T cells and partially dependent on CD8+ T  cells. Anti-GITR IgG2a demonstrated superior efficacy to anti-GITR IgG1 in driving antitumor effects. Collectively, these results suggest that combinatorial strategies targeting multiple points of tumor immune evasion may lead to a robust and lasting antitumor response."

The eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is responsible for the integrated stress response (ISR) of unfolded protein response (UPR) which can affect immune cell function in tumor microenvironment.

The protein levels of IRF1, eIF2α, and ATF4 were consistently correlated in the tumor tissues but to various extents in the normal ones. The protein level of PDL1 was not correlated  with those of STAT1 and STAT2 in all the tissues. The PDL1 expression in lung cancer may be independent of STAT1 and STAT2.

Here, we aimed to understand the contribution of the genetics of lung cancer to the ability of tumor cells to escape immunosurveillance checkpoints.Experimental Design: More than 150 primary non-small cell lung cancers, including pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas, were tested for levels of the HLA-I complex, PD-L1, tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes, and alterations in main lung cancer genes. Correlations were validated in cancer cell lines using appropriate treatments to  activate or inhibit selected pathways. We also performed RNA sequencing to assess changes in gene expression after these treatments.Results:MET-oncogenic activation tended to associate with positive PD-L1 immunostaining, whereas STK11  mutations were correlated with negative immunostaining. In MET-altered cancer cells, MET triggered a transcriptional increase of PD-L1 that was independent of  the IFNγ-mediated JAK/STAT pathway. The activation of MET also upregulated other  immunosuppressive genes (PDCD1LG2 and SOCS1) and transcripts involved in angiogenesis (VEGFA and NRP1) and in cell proliferation. We also report recurrent inactivating mutations in JAK2 that co-occur with alterations in MET and STK11, which prevented the induction of immunoresponse-related genes following treatment with IFNγ.We show that MET activation promotes the expression of several negative checkpoint regulators of the immunoresponse, including PD-L1. In addition, we report inactivation of JAK2 in lung cancer cells that prevented the  response to IFNγ. These alterations are likely to facilitate tumor growth by enabling immune tolerance and may affect the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors."

REVIEW Studies of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (avelumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab) that had available hazard ratios for death based on PD-L1 positivity or negativity were included. The threshold for PD-L1 positivity or negativity was that PD-L1 stained cell accounted for 1% of tumour cells, or tumour and immune cells, assayed by immunohistochemistry staining methods. 4174 patients with advanced or metastatic cancers from eight randomised  controlled trials were included in this study. Compared with conventional agents, PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors were associated with significantly prolonged overall survival in both patients that were PD-L1 positive (n=2254, hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.74) and PD-L1 negative (1920, 0.80, 0.71 to 0.90).

The biological role of PD-L1 in ADC was explored using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Results: Positive PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was observed in 38.5% (40/104). High PD-L1 expression levels were significantly correlated with poor overall survival (P=0.008).

Results and In very lethal non-small cell lung cancer subtypes such  as the sarcomatoid variants, high tumor burden and deteriorated general conditions should not preclude, at least in some cases, the use of immunotherapy. Anti-PD1 may also have a reliable role in disease control in the brain.

To circumvent some of the limitations posed by the lack of appropriate animal models in preclinical studies of immunotherapies, partially human leukocyte antigen-matched TNBC PDX tumor lines from our collection, as well as human melanoma cell lines, were engrafted in humanized nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency IL2Rγnull (hNSG) mice obtained by intravenous injection of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells into nonlethally irradiated 3-4-week-old mice.  After both PDXs and melanoma cell xenografts reached ~ 150-200 mm3, animals were  treated with humanized anti-PD-1 antibody or anti-CTLA-4 and evaluated for tumor  growth, survival, and potential mechanism of action. Human CD45+, CD20+, CD3+, CD8+, CD56+, CD68+, and CD33+ cells were readily identified in blood, spleen, and bone marrow collected from hNSG, as well as human cytokines in blood and engrafted tumors. Engraftment of TNBC PDXs in hNSG was high (~ 85%), although they grew at a slightly slower pace and conserved their ability to generate lung metastasis. Human CD45+ cells were detectable in hNSG-harbored PDXs, and consistent with clinical observations, anti-PD-1 antibody therapy resulted in both a significant reduction in tumor growth and increased survival in some of the hNSG PDX tumor lines, whereas no such effects were observed in the corresponding non-hNSG models. This study provides evidence associated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy against TNBC tumors supporting the use of TNBC PDXs in humanized mice as a model  to overcome some of the technical difficulties associated with the preclinical investigation of immune-based therapies."

Based on previous immunotherapy knowledge, agents targeting immune checkpoints seem to be remarkably effective in a wide range of tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) provide longlasting responses in specific patients. Nevertheless,  with overall response rates ≤ 20%, combinational protocols for various patient subgroups are needed. A good partner treatment to immunotherapy could be chemotherapy, as it successfully modulates the immune response either by controlling or enhancing the antitumor immune activity. Primary research provides promising results in metastatic NSCLC patients using this approach, but further large-scale trials are needed. The implementation of immunotherapy in nonmetastatic cases is also appealing. We review the potential clinical benefits  of immunotherapy alone or in concert with chemotherapy in NSCLC."

Most cancer immunotherapeutic approaches seek to amplify cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific to malignant cells. A recently identified subpopulation of memory CD8+ T cells, named tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells, persists in peripheral tissues and does not recirculate. This T-cell subset is considered an independent memory  T-cell lineage with a specific profile of transcription factors, including Runx3+, Notch+, Hobit+, Blimp1+, BATF+, AHR+, EOMESneg and Tbetlow. It is defined by expression of CD103 (αE(CD103)β7) and CD49a (VLA-1 or α1β1) integrins and C-type lectin CD69, which are most likely involved in retention of TRM cells in non-lymphoid tissues, including solid tumors. CD103 binds to the epithelial cell  marker E-cadherin, thereby favoring the location and retention of TRM in epithelial tumor regions in close contact with malignant cells. The CD103-E-cadherin interaction is required for polarized exocytosis of lytic granules, in particular, when ICAM-1 expression on cancer cells is missing, leading to target cell death. TRM cells also express high levels of granzyme B, IFNγ and TNFα, supporting their cytotoxic features. Moreover, the local route of  immunization targeting tissue dendritic cells (DC), and the presence of environmental factors (i.e. TGF-β, IL-33 and IL-15), promote differentiation of this T-cell subtype. In both spontaneous tumor models and engrafted tumors, natural TRM cells or cancer-vaccine-induced TRM directly control tumor growth. In line with these results, TRM infiltration into various human cancers, including lung cancer, are correlated with better clinical outcome in both univariate and multivariate analyses independently of CD8+ T cells. TRM cells also predominantly express checkpoint receptors such as PD-1, CTLA-4 and Tim-3. Blockade of PD-1 with neutralizing antibodies on TRM cells isolated from human lung cancer promotes cytolytic activity toward autologous tumor cells. Thus, TRM cells appear to represent important components in tumor immune surveillance. Their induction by cancer vaccines or other immunotherapeutic approaches may be critical for the  success of these treatments. Several arguments, such as their close contact with  tumor cells, dominant expression of checkpoint receptors and their recognition of cancer cells, strongly suggest that they may be involved in the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in various cancers."

While many published articles and guidelines are focusing on the presentation and upfront treatment of pulmonary irAEs, the strategy in patients with late-onset pneumonia that are resistant to commonly used immunosuppressive drugs remains unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report the successful treatment of a mycophenolate-resistant organizing pneumonia (OP) with infliximab in a patient with metastatic melanoma after PD-1 blockade. The patient received two years of PD-1 targeted immunotherapy when he developed multiple nodular lung lesions mimicking a metastatic progression. However, wedge resection of these lesions showed defined areas of OP, which responded well to corticosteroids. Upon tapering, new foci of OP developed which were resistant to high-dose steroids and mycophenolate treatment. The TNFα antagonist infliximab led to a rapid and durable regression of the inflammatory lesions. CONCLUSION: This case describes a not well-studied situation, in which a mycophenolate-resistant PD-1 blocker-associated pneumonitis was successfully treated with a TNFα neutralizing antibody. The outcome of this case suggests that infliximab might be the preferable option compared to classical immunosuppressants in the case of steroid-resistant/-dependent late onset pulmonary irAEs."

TNBC has increased programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and its immunosuppressive nature makes it suitable for immune checkpoint blockade therapy. However, the response rate of TNBC to anti-PD-L1 or anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy remains unsatisfactory, as only 10-20% of TNBC patients have a partial response. Glycosylated PD-L1, the functional form of PD-L1, is required for PD-L1-PD-1 interaction. TNBC cells have significantly higher levels of glycosylated PD-L1 than non-TNBC cells do. In a screening of glucose analogs to block PD-L1 glycosylation, we found that 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) can act as a glucose analog to decrease PD-L1 glycosylation. Because PARP inhibition upregulates PD-L1, 2-DG reduced PARP inhibition-mediated expression of glycosylated PD-L1. The combination of PARP inhibition and 2-DG had potent anti-tumor activity. Together, our results provide a strong rationale for investigating the targeting of PD-L1 glycosylation in TNBC further."

B cells have been found in MPE; however, little is known about their roles there. In the present study, by using mouse MPE models, we noted that although the total B cells in MPE were decreased as compared with the corresponding blood and spleen, the percentage of  activated naïve B cells expressing higher levels of CD80, CD86, myosin heavy chain-II, CD44, CD69, and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) molecules were increased in wild-type mouse MPE. Compared with wild-type mice, decreased T helper (TH)1 cells and increased TH17 cells were present in B cell-deficient mouse MPE, which paralleled to the reduced MPE volume and longer survival time. Adoptive transfer of activated naïve B cells into B cell-deficient mice was able  to increase TH1 cells and decrease TH17 cells in MPE and shorten the survival of  mice bearing MPE. Furthermore, we demonstrated that activated naïve B cells inhibited TH17-cell expansion via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and promoted naïve CD4+  T-cell differentiation into TH1/TH17 cells through secreting IL-27/IL-6 independent of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Collectively, our data uncovered a mechanism by which naïve B cells promote MPE formation by regulating TH1/TH17 cell responses, making these B cells an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in the fight against cancer."

However, the coexpression of IDO-1 and PD-L1 has not been thoroughly investigated, and the potential for IDO-1 immunohistochemical expression as a therapeutic biomarker is unknown. One hundred two cases of NSCLC (51 adenocarcinomas, 9 adenosquamous carcinomas, and 42 squamous cell carcinomas) were evaluated for IDO-1 and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry. IDO-1 expression was identified in 43% of NSCLC (42% of adenocarcinomas, 44% of adenosquamous carcinomas, and 43% of squamous cell carcinomas). Coexpression with PD-L1 (≥1%) was common (27% overall; 27% of adenocarcinomas, 33% of adenosquamous carcinomas, and 26% of squamous cell carcinomas). A smaller population of tumors showed isolated PD-L1 (25% overall; 16% of adenocarcinomas, 44% of adenosquamous carcinomas, and 33% of squamous cell carcinomas) or IDO-1 expression (15% overall; 14% of adenocarcinomas, 11% of adenosquamous carcinomas, and 17% of squamous cell carcinomas). In summary, IDO-1 is commonly expressed by NSCLC, and its frequent coexpression with PD-L1 may account for the increased efficacy seen with dual blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 and IDO  in clinical studies. IDO-1 immunohistochemistry may be a useful biomarker for selection of patients who could benefit from dual-agent therapy and should be evaluated in prospective clinical trials using PD-1/PD-L1 and IDO inhibitors."

Given their mechanism of action, immune-related adverse events have been associated with their use. We present the first documented case of pembrolizumab-induced grade IV neutropenia. A 73-year-old women known for myositis, Crohn's disease, and hypothyroidism and diagnosed with PD-L1 positive stage IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma is treated with Pembrolizumab. She develops grade IV neutropenia 2 weeks after her second infusion. She is therefore hospitalized and treated initially with corticosteroids, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Given the persistent neutropenia, cyclosporine was added, but quickly stopped owing to fever. The patient recovered her neutrophils  6.5 weeks after her initial Pembrolizumab infusion and 12 days after admission. She has been subsequently successfully tapered off steroids with no recurrence after 3 months of follow-up. This is the first case of grade IV neutropenia secondary to Pembrolizumab. This case is of particular interest given the patient's pre-existing autoimmune history. Treatment of severe neutropenia due to other PD1 inhibitors has generally consisted of steroids, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, intravenous immunoglobulins, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A, and anti-thymocyte globulins - though the benefits of immunosuppression are not clear and may be harmful given the infectious risks.

Herein, we investigated clinical features of IDO1+/PDL1+ primary lung adenocarcinoma. IDO1 and PDL1 expression in 388 resected primary lung adenocarcinoma samples was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and the radiological features of patients with IDO1+/PDL1+ lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed. Of 388 specimens, 229 (59.0%) were IDO1+, 131 (33.8%) were PDL1+, and 109 (28.1%) were IDO1+/PDL1+ In multivariate analysis, vascular convergence and the absence of surrounding ground glass opacity were significantly associated with IDO1+/PDL1+ tumors. Fisher's exact test showed high consolidation/tumor ratio was also significantly associated with IDO1+/PDL1+ tumors. Moreover, maximum standardized uptake in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography/computed tomography was significantly higher in patients with IDO1+/PDL1+ tumors than in those with IDO1- or PDL1- tumors.

The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 is thought to play an important role in the regulation of the self-immune tolerance mechanism, so blocking these molecules may cause serious immune-related adverse events (IrAE), including fulminant insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes. Here, we describe a patient with fulminant type 1 diabetes induced by nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody. The patient, a 78-year-old man, was being treated with nivolumab as a third-line treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. After three cycles, he experienced an abrupt flare-up of the blood glucose within half a day. His blood glucose further increased without clinical symptoms until his hospital visit. Laboratory data showed the complete exhaustion of intrinsic insulin and the elevation of serum antibody titer to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Although the patient was previously diagnosed with non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes, his disease activity had been well controlled with oral medication and low-dose insulin therapy until just before the flare-up. Because of the laboratory findings and the extremely rapid onset of hyperglycemia, a diagnosis of fulminant, rather than the rapid onset, type 1 diabetes related to nivolumab therapy was strongly suspected. Our case study indicates that fulminant hyperglycemia can occur extremely rapidly. The blood glucose of patients receiving PD-1 antibody therapy  should be closely monitored."

This raises the question, which all mechanisms inhibit T cell function in the tumor environment, restricting the efficacy of these immunotherapeutic approaches. Serum activity of lactate dehydrogenase, likely reflecting the glycolytic activity of the tumor cells and thus acidity within the tumor microenvironment, turned out to be one of the strongest markers predicting  response to checkpoint inhibition.

IDO1 was overexpressed in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, and plasma Kyn levels were increased, in 344SQ_R vs. 344SQ_P.

As the most abundant immune cells in TME, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play nonredundant roles in restricting antitumor immunity. The leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (Lgr4, also known as Gpr48) has been associated with multiple physiologic and pathologic functions. Lgr4 and its ligands R-spondin 1-4 have been shown to promote the growth and metastasis of tumor cells. However, whether Lgr4 can promote tumor progression by regulating the function of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Lgr4 promotes macrophage M2 polarization through Rspo/Lgr4/Erk/Stat3 signaling. Notably, urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), and B16F10 melanoma tumors were all markedly reduced in Lgr4fl/flLyz2cre/+ mice, characterized by fewer protumoral M2 TAMs and increased CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration in the TME. Furthermore, LLC tumor growth was greatly depressed when Rspo/Lgr4/Erk/Stat3 signaling was blocked with either the LGR4 extracellular domain or an anti-Rspo1 antibody. Importantly, blocking Rspo-Lgr4 signaling overcame LLC resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy and improved the efficacy of PD-1 immunotherapy against B16F10 melanoma, indicating vital roles of Rspo-Lgr4 in host antitumor immunity and a potential therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy.Significance: This study identifies a novel receptor as a critical  switch in TAM polarization whose inhibition sensitizes checkpoint therapy-resistant lung cancer to anti-PD-1 therapy."

Here, we show that a TLR9  agonist delivered by inhalation is able to prime T-cell responses against poorly  immunogenic lung tumors and to complement the effects of PD-1 blockade. Inhaled TLR9 agonist causes profound remodeling in tumor-bearing lungs, leading to the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures adjacent to the tumors, CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumors, dendritic cell expansion, and antibody production.  Inhalation of TLR9 agonist also increased the pool of functional PD-1lowT-bethigh effector CD8+ T cells in tumor-bearing lungs. Effector CD8+ T cells generated by  inhaled TLR9 agonist treatment were licensed by PD-1 blockade to become highly functional CTLs, leading to a durable rejection of both lung tumors and tumor lesions outside the lungs. CD4+ T cells activated in response to inhaled TLR9 play a critical role in this process by controlling the proliferation, preventing exhaustion, and guiding the differentiation of optimally functional CTLs. This study characterizes a strategy to apply localized TLR9 stimulation to a tumor type not accessible for direct injection, a strategy that may expand the therapeutic potential of PD-1 blockade in non-small cell lung cancer.Significance: These findings demonstrate that local delivery of a toll-like receptor 9 agonist can change the immune content of an entire organ and enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition."

We investigated the significance of plasma sPD-L1 levels as a biomarker for anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, nivolumab therapy. The present prospective study included 39 NSCLC patients. The patients were treated with nivolumab at the dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and the effects of nivolumab on NSCLC were assessed according to the change in tumor size, time to treatment failure (TTF), and overall survival (OS). The baseline plasma sPD-L1 concentration was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve  was 0.761. The calculated optimal cutoff point for sPD-L1 in the plasma samples was 3.357 ng/mL. Of the 39 patients, 59% with low plasma sPD-L1 levels achieved a complete response or partial response and 25% of those with high plasma sPD-L1 levels did so. In addition, 22% of the patients with low plasma sPD-L1 levels developed progressive disease compared with 75% of those with high plasma sPD-L1  levels. The TTF and OS were significantly longer for those patients with low plasma sPD-L1 levels compared with the TTF and OS for those with high plasma sPD-L1 levels. CONCLUSION: The clinical benefit from nivolumab therapy was significantly associated with the baseline plasma sPD-L1 levels. Plasma sPD-L1 levels might represent a novel biomarker for the prediction of the efficacy of nivolumab therapy against NSCLC."

The data from patients with pathologic stage I or II NSCLC who had undergone surgery from January 2007 to January 2016 were analyzed. We identified 62 patients with pathologic stage I or II NSCLC and ILD. We compared these patients with 1:1-matched cohort. In both groups with and without ILD, approximately 60% were PD-L1+.

During chemotherapy, suppressive markers were down-regulated in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with partial remission or stable disease. Additionally, interferon-γ production was also augmented during this period. In vitro assay showed that docetaxel reduced the expression of PD-1 on T-cell subsets without altering cell death. Further tests in Jurkat T cells demonstrated that docetaxel activated signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling to suppress PD-1 expression, whereas STAT3 inhibition reversed the down-regulation of PD-1.

Baseline NLR ≤4 was associated with superior DCR (74% vs. 50%;  P = .025), treatment duration (P = .037), time to progression (P = .053), and overall survival (P = .019), with no differential association according to PD-L1  tumor expression. Lower NLR and ANC during treatment were also associated with response to treatment (P = .025 and P = .017, respectively), and treatment duration (P = .036 and P = .008). No association was found between baseline PLR and DCR, response, treatment duration, nor overall survival. CONCLUSION: Baseline NLR ≤4 and lower NLR and ANC during treatment might correlate with disease control and treatment response and should be explored further as potential predictors of treatment benefit in larger studies."

However, along with PDL1 and molecular features other clinical, radiological and laboratory factors can be considered for the selection of those patients who would not be the best candidate for immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs). We examined these factors, emerging from the results of currently available studies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aiming to provide a useful and manageable tool which can help Oncologists in their everyday clinical practice. A thorough patient evaluation and close clinical monitoring, due to limited, early or inconclusive currently available data, should be deserved for patients with a pre-existing symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, age >75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≥ 1, a time to progression (TTP) < three months and progressive disease (PD) as the best response to the previous treatment, hepatitis or HIV-infections, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), or on treatment with high-dose steroids, when the use of ICPIs is considered. Limited data are available to consider that ICPIs are safe in patients with interstitial  lung disease, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia and autommune diseases. Early evidence on steroids, vaccinations and antibiotics suggest their  possible interaction with ICPIs and need to be more investigated in clinical trials. Oncogene-addicted NSCLC harboring EGFR-mutations and low tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs) seems not to gain benefit from I-O."

The purpose of this article is to review the most innovative and clinically promising ICB-based combinations designed to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: First-line combinatorial treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab has recently shown to be superior to the standard of care in a subset of metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The  combination of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 blockade with antiangiogenics has demonstrated a consistent clinical efficacy, especially for the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab as first-line therapy in metastatic RCC. The sequential combination of definitive chemoradiotherapy followed by durvalumab maintenance in advanced, unresectable NSCLC became the new standard of care, while the addition of pembrolizumab to first-line chemotherapy  in metastatic NSCLC significantly improves overall survival. Despite promising results for the combination of ICBs with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B/MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitors or epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, especially in melanoma and NSCLC, safety concerns slowed down the development of such strategies. Immunotherapy-based combinations are becoming the standard of care for cancer treatment, in particularly for advanced melanoma, NSCLC and RCC."

Here, we report final analyses from the non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort of the first atezolizumab phase I study. Patients with NSCLC received atezolizumab 1-20 mg/kg or 1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression on tumour cells (TCs) and  tumour-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) was assessed (VENTANA SP142 immunohistochemistry assay). Exploratory subgroup analyses investigated responses by baseline PD-L1 expression and oncogenic mutational status. Eighty-nine patients, 98% of whom had received previous systemic therapy, were evaluable for safety and antitumour activity. Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with grade III/IV treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) observed in 10 patients (11%). All-grade TRAEs occurring in >10% of patients were fatigue, nausea and decreased appetite; grade III/IV TRAEs occurring in >2% of patients were fatigue, dyspnoea, hyponatremia and hypoxia. One patient died from treatment-unrelated pneumonia. Objective response rate (ORR) was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28%-72%), 33% (20%-48%), 29% (18%-41%) and 11% (1%-35%) for the TC3 or IC3, TC2/3 or IC2/3, TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 and TC0 and IC0 subgroups, respectively.

Little is known whether the uptake of 18F-FDG within cancer cells is linked to the expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), a  predictor of anti-PD-1 antibody. We conducted a clinicopathological study to assess the expression of PD-L1 and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with surgically resected pulmonary adenocarcinoma (AC) who received preoperative 18F-FDG PET. A total of 315 patients with lung AC who received 18F-FDG PET were enrolled in the study. Tumour specimens were stained by immunohistochemistry for glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), PD-L1, CD4 and CD8. We assessed whether the uptake of 18F-FDG was correlated with clinicopathological variables. PD-L1 was highly expressed in  60% of all patients with AC, and the expression level was significantly correlated with 18F-FDG uptake, glucose metabolism and hypoxia. PD-L1 and the maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) were identified as independent prognostic predictors by multivariate analysis. In particular, PD-L1 could be a significant marker for predicting worse outcomes in AC patients with high 18F-FDG uptake but not in those with low 18F-FDG uptake. According to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, the expression of PD-L1 was significantly correlated with SUVmax in patients with EGFR mutation, whereas, PD-L1 was a significant predictive negative factor in those with wild-type EGFR.  18F-FDG uptake was significantly correlated with PD-L1 expression, and the latter was closely linked to the presence of glucose metabolism and hypoxia in patients  with pulmonary AC."

PD-L1 expression in the tumor has been established as a biomarker of the effects of pembrolizumab; however, a number of PD-L1-negative patients have benefited from nivolumab or other immune checkpoint  inhibitors, suggesting that there might be additional relevant biomarkers. Notably, tumor mutation burden or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes might be useful  biomarkers for these patients; the gut microbiome has received similar attention. It has been reported that mouse models of melanoma with certain types of microbiomes benefit from the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Even in human cases, those with certain types of microbiomes tended to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment and exhibited elevated CD8-positive T cell counts. Additionally, when combined with antibiotics, the effect of the anti-PD-1 antibody was attenuated; conversely, mice that were treated with certain species  of bacteria experienced beneficial outcomes from anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. This suggested that manipulation of the gut microbiome might alter treatment effects. Here, we analyzed the microbiome of 12 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC who were treated with anti-PD-1 antibody. There was no major difference between before and after administration in microbiome of each case. Cluster analysis indicated no significant differences in oral microbiomes among the patients before the administration of the anti-PD-1 antibody. Comparative analysis of the patients' gut microbiomes is ongoing. We plan to continue further examination to reveal whether the intestinal environment influences the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients."

There are limited but emerging data on expression of these molecules in HIV-infected lung cancer patients. We reviewed archived lung cancer tissue samples from HIV-infected cases (n = 13) and HIV-uninfected controls (n = 13) from 2001-2015.  Cases and controls were matched by histology and stage. Immunostained tumor sections were analyzed for percent of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 and B7-H3, and percent of tumor infiltrating immune cells (TII) expressing PD-1 and PD-L1. Positive expression was defined as >5%. Statistical analysis was performed using  the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and the chi-square test. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was positive in 23% of cases and 46% of  controls. B7-H3 expression on tumor cells was positive in 92% of cases and 69% of controls. PD-1 expression on TII was positive in 69% of cases and 54% of controls. PD-L1 expression on TII was positive in 31% of cases and 69% of controls.

Appropriate biomarker selection is therefore essential for improving treatment efficacy. However, the establishment of PD-L1 assay in pathology laboratories is complicated by the presence of multiple testing platforms using different scoring systems. Here we assessed the PD-L1 expression in 713 consecutive non-small cell lung carcinomas by four commercially available PD-L1 immunohistochemical assays, namely, 22C3, 28-8, SP142 and SP263. The analytical performances of the four assays and diagnostic performances across clinically relevant cutoffs were evaluated. The prevalence of PD-L1 (22C3) expression was 21% with a ≥50% cutoff and 56% with a ≥1% cutoff. High PD-L1 expression (using a ≥50% cutoff) was significantly associated with male sex (P = 0.001), ever smoking history (P < 0.001), squamous  cell carcinoma (P = 0.001), large cell carcinoma (P < 0.001), lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (P = 0.006), sarcomatoid carcinoma (P < 0.001),  mutant KRAS (P = 0.005) and wild-type EGFR (P = 0.003). Elevated PD-L1 expression was also significantly associated with shorter survival in patients with adenocarcinoma (log-rank P = 0.026) and remained an independent prognostic factor by multivariable analysis. Among the four assays, 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 were highly concordant for tumor cell scoring. With a cutoff of ≥50% (i.e., the threshold for first-line patient selection), inter-rater agreement was high among the three assays with percentage agreement >97%. In conclusion, three PD-L1 assays showed good analytical performance and a high agreement with each other, but not all cases were correctly classified using the same clinical cutoff. Further studies comparing the predictive value of these assays are required to address the interchangeability of these assays for clinical use."

However, the optimal selection of eligible patients who will benefit most, is far from being clear and the best biomarker has not yet been established. PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in NSCLC patients has shown some value for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in some studies, but not in others, and  its use has been complicated by a number of factors which has prompted many researchers to establish better predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy of NSCLC. Most recently, two phase III first-line NSCLC studies have provided evidence that tumour mutational burden (TMB) correlates with the clinical response to the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (CheckMate-227; NCT02477826), whereas atezolizumab response was correlated with T effector gene signature expression (IMPower 150; NCT02366143). Both studies demonstrated a significant primary endpoint [progression-free survival (PFS)] benefit in the TMB group and in the group of patients expressing a T effector cell signature, respectively. However,  PFS benefit in both studies was seen regardless of the PD-L1 status of all patients suggesting that TMB and T effector cell signatures may be more robust to predict clinical response following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. The role of putative novel predictive biomarkers evaluated in the CheckMate-227 and the IMPower 150 trials may, if confirmed in future prospective studies, offer a new perspective for predicting immunotherapy treatment outcomes of NSCLC patients in the near future."

ATR is a DNA damage-signaling kinase activated at damaged replication forks, and ATR kinase inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging chemotherapies. We show here that the ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 combines with conformal radiation therapy to attenuate radiation-induced CD8+ T cell exhaustion and potentiate CD8+ T cell activity in mouse models of Kras-mutant cancer. Mechanistically, AZD6738 blocks radiation-induced PD-L1 upregulation on tumor cells and dramatically decreases the number of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Remarkably, AZD6738 combines with conformal radiation therapy to generate immunologic memory in complete responder mice. Our work raises the possibility that a single pharmacologic agent may enhance the cytotoxic effects of radiation while concurrently potentiating radiation-induced antitumor immune responses."

We have recently demonstrated that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells transduced with a PD1-CD28 fusion protein are protected from PD-1-mediated  inhibition. We have now investigated the potential of PD1-CD28 fusion protein-transduced CD4+ T cells alone or in combination with CD8+ T cells for immunotherapy of pancreatic cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Methods: OVA-specific CD4+ and CD8+ were retrovirally transduced with the PD1-CD28 fusion  protein. Cytokine release, proliferation, cytotoxic activity, and phenotype of transduced T cells were assessed in the context of Panc02-OVA (murine pancreatic  cancer model) and E.G7-PD-L1 (murine T cell lymphoma model) cells. Results: Stimulation of PD1-CD28 fusion protein-transduced CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 and  recombinant PD-L1 induced specific T cell activation, as measured by IFN-y release and T cell proliferation. Coculture with Panc02-OVA or E.G7-PD-L1 tumor cells also led to specific activation of CD4+ T cells. Cytokine release and T cell proliferation was most effective when tumor cells simultaneously encountered genetically engineered CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Synergy between both cell populations was also observed for specific tumor cell lysis. T cell cytotoxicity  was mediated via granzyme B release and mediated enhanced tumor control in vivo.  Transduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in co-culture with tumor cells developed a predominant central memory phenotype over time. Different ratios of CD4+ and CD8+ transduced T cells led to a significant increase of IFN-y and IL-2 secretion positively correlating with CD4+ T cell numbers used. Mechanistically, IL-2 and MHC-I were central to the synergistic activity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, since neutralization of IL-2 prevented the crosstalk between these cell populations. PD1-CD28 fusion protein-transduced CD4+ T cells significantly improved anti-tumoral effect of fusion protein-transduced CD8+ T cells. Thus, our results indicate that PD1-CD28 fusion protein-transduced CD4+ T cells have the potential to overcome the PD-1-PD-L1 immunosuppressive axis in pancreatic cancer  and non-Hodgkin lymphoma."

Surgery remains the most efficient treatment prior melanoma invasion and metastasis formation. However, therapy becomes a challenge  once the cancer cells colonized other tissues. At present, there are two main classes of therapies acting with a certain efficiency on metastatic melanoma: immune check point inhibitors (anti-PD1/PDL1) and targeted therapy such as Vemurafenib. Unfortunately, these therapies are not fully responsive, induce resistance and/or generate unwanted side effects. In this respect, it is important to continue to discover new cancer therapeutics. Here, we show that daphnane diterpenes type of compounds can prevent melanoma metastasis by inhibiting metastasis-associated matrix metalloproteinases expression without cytotoxicity. Evaluation of the anti-metastasis effect of daphnane diterpenes-rich Thymelaea hirsuta extract (TH) and its bioactive component gnidilatidin was carried out in vitro using B16 murine melanoma cells and in vivo using male C57BL/6 J mice. Global gene expression in B16 cells was done using DNA microarray, validated using real-time PCR, to further understand the effect of daphnane diterpenes, specifically daphnane diterpenoid gnidilatidin. Oral administration of daphnane diterpenes-rich Thymelaea hirsuta extract (TH) suppressed MMP2 and MMP9 expression, decreasing lung tumor in mice injected with B16 murine melanoma cells. Validation of these observations in vitro showed reduced B16 cells migration, adhesion, and invasion. Results of microarray analysis of B16 cells treated with daphnane diterpenoid gnidilatidin from TH revealed an upregulation of tumor suppressor Egr1 while inhibiting metastasis-associated genes Id2 and Sytl2 expression. A downregulation of the melanoma oncogene microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) was observed, and most likely caused by the inhibition of Id2, a gene that regulated  HLH transcription factors such as MITF and also reported to promote tumor cell migration and invasion. Daphnane diterpenes have inhibitory effect on the metastatic potential of B16 melanoma cells, and the results of this study provided evidence  for their potential for use in the prevention and inhibition of melanoma metastasis."

This report identifies an intrinsic mechanism by which programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) signaling imparted regulatory phenotype to Foxp3+ Th1 cells (denoted as Tbet+iTregPDL1 cells) and inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cells. Tbet+iTregPDL1 cells prevented inflammation in murine models of experimental colitis and experimental graft versus host disease (GvHD). Programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) binding to PD-1 imparted regulatory function to Tbet+iTregPDL1 cells and iTreg cells by specifically downregulating endo-lysosomal protease asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP). AEP regulated Foxp3 stability and blocking AEP imparted regulatory function in Tbet+iTreg cells. Also, Aep-/- iTreg cells significantly inhibited GvHD and maintained Foxp3 expression. PD-1-mediated Foxp3 maintenance in Tbet+ Th1 cells occurred both in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and during chronic viral infection. Collectively, this report has identified an intrinsic function for PD-1 in maintaining Foxp3 through proteolytic pathway."

This study comprised 127 patients with EC. Anti PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 antibodies were examined immunohistochemically on sections obtained from tissue microarray paraffin blocks. No staining with PD-1 in tumor cells was seen; however, we found positive staining in tumor cells at 36.2% with PD-L1 and 64.4% with PD-L2, and at 61.6% with PD-1, 36.2% with PD-L1,  and 93.2% with PD-L2 in immune cells. When comparing staining and clinicopathologic findings , most of the PD-L1 negative tumors (both in tumor and immune cells) were FIGO Stage I, which was significantly higher than stage II-III-IV tumors (P<0.05). There was a statistically significant association between the FIGO grade and the PD-L1 score in immune cells (P=0.009), and between staining of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and age (P=0.004, 0.013, and 0.043, respectively).

We describe the case of an 81-year-old male with cT1aN2M1b stage IV pleomorphic carcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung. After primary treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel, recurrence was observed in the left supraclavicular lymph node and left adrenal gland. We initiated the administration of nivolumab as a secondary treatment. Reduction was observed in the swelling of the left supraclavicular lymph node and left adrenal gland, but the tumor shadow in the right upper lobe appeared to increase. Bronchoscopy was performed, and the biopsy result showed granulomas; the findings resembled a sarcoid-like granulomatous reaction. The shadows eventually disappeared with nivolumab discontinuation; thus, we concluded that the sarcoid-like granulomatous reaction had resulted from nivolumab administration. Based on our observations, we suggest that when invasive shadows are observed after nivolumab administration, it is necessary to differentiate between disease progression and  interstitial pneumonia. Moreover, the decision to reinitiate nivolumab treatment  requires careful judgment in future instances of cancer recurrence."

Clinical success of therapies is not very promising due to - late diagnosis, limited therapeutic tools, relapse and the development of drug resistance. Recently, small ∼20-24 nucleotides molecules  called microRNAs (miRNAs) have come into the limelight as they play outstanding role in the process of tumorigenesis by regulating cell cycle, metastasis, angiogenesis, metabolism and apoptosis. miRNAs essentially regulate gene expression via post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. Nevertheless, few studies have conceded the role of miRNAs in activation of gene expression. A large body of data generated by numerous studies is suggestive of their tumor-suppressing, oncogenic, diagnostic and prognostic biomarker roles in lung cancer. They have also been implicated in regulating cancer cell metabolism and resistance or sensitivity towards chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Further, miRNAs have also been convoluted in regulation of immune checkpoints - Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1). These molecules play a significant role in tumor immune escape leading to the generation of a microenvironment favouring tumor growth and progression. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the expression of miRNA and understand its relevance in lung cancer and development of anti-cancer strategies (anti - miRs, miR mimics and micro RNA sponges). In view of the above, the role of miRNA in lung cancer has been dissected and the associated mechanisms and pathways are discussed in this review."

QIF is used to simultaneously measure the level  of CD3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in situ T-cell proliferation (Ki-67 in CD3) and effector capacity (Granzyme-B in CD3). Elevated mutational load, candidate class-I neoantigens or intratumoral CD3 signal are significantly  associated with favorable response to therapy. Additionally, a dormant TIL signature is associated with survival benefit in patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers characterized by elevated TILs with low activation and proliferation. We further demonstrate that dormant TILs can be reinvigorated upon PD-1 blockade in a patient-derived xenograft model."

However, only a small proportion of NSCLC patients responded to monotherapy of anti-PD-1/PDL1 agents; together, the development of resistance to  anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy that leads to failure of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy has significantly limited a broad applicability of the findings in clinical practices.

Unfortunately, only 25-30% of patients experience a durable benefit, while the vast majority demonstrate primary or acquired resistance. Recently, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity has been proposed as a possible mechanism of resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment leading to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Pre-treatment serum concentrations of tryptophan (trp) and kynurenine (kyn) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in NSCLC patients treated with second-line nivolumab. The IDO activity was expressed with kyn/trp ratio. The associations between kyn/trp ratio and early progression, performance status (PS), age, sex, brain metastases, pleural effusion, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were  analyzed using Spearman test and Mann-Whitney test. Twenty-six NSCLC patients were included in our study; 14 of them (54%) presented early progression (< 3 months) to nivolumab treatment. The median value of kyn/trp ratio was 0.06 µg/ml and the median value of quinolinic acid was 68.45 ng/ml. A significant correlation between early progression and higher kyn/trp ratio and quinolinic acid concentration was observed (p = 0.017 and p = 0.005, respectively). Patients presenting lower values of kyn/trp ratio and quinolinic acid levels showed longer PFS (median PFS not reached versus 3 months; HR: 0.3; p = 0.018) and OS (median OS not reached vs 3 months; HR: 0.18; p = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: IDO activity, expressed as kyn/trp ratio, is associated with response to immunotherapy; in particular, higher kyn/trp ratio could predict resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment. These preliminary results suggest the possibility of using anti-PD-1 plus IDO inhibitor in those patients with high level of kyn/trp ratio."

We found 18,175 expressed clonal somatic mutations, with an average of 124 per patient.

Factors that  influence clinical response to PD1-PDL1 inhibitors include tumor mutational burden, immune infiltration of the tumor, and local PDL1 expression. To identify  peripheral correlates of the anti-tumor immune response in the absence of checkpoint blockade, we performed a retrospective study of circulating T cell subpopulations and matched tumor gene expression in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Notably, both melanoma and NSCLC patients whose tumors exhibited increased inflammatory gene transcripts presented high CD4+ and  CD8+ central memory T cell (CM) to effector T cell (Eff) ratios in blood. Consequently, we evaluated CM/Eff T cell ratios in a second cohort of NSCLC. The  data showed that high CM/Eff T cell ratios correlated with increased tumor PDL1 expression. Furthermore, of the 22 patients within this NSCLC cohort who received nivolumab, those with high CM/Eff T cell ratios, had longer progression-free survival (PFS) (median survival: 91 vs. 215 days). These findings show that by providing a window into the state of the immune system, peripheral T cell subpopulations inform about the state of the anti-tumor immune response and identify potential blood biomarkers of clinical response to checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma and NSCLC."

Herein, we evaluated the functional characteristics of DC vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells with regard to immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastric cancer patients who were administered Wilms tumor protein-1 (WT1)-targeted DC vaccine. We observed the upregulation of the inhibitory molecule, TIGIT and the inhibitory T cell co-receptors PD1 and Tim3 in limiting WT1-specific CD8+ T cell growth and function in GC patients. TIGIT-expressing PD1+Tim3- CD8+ T cells were the largest subset, while TIGIT+PD1+Tim3+ was the most dysfunctional subset of WT1-specific CD8+ T cells in gastric cancer patients. Importantly, the co-inhibition of TIGIT, PD1, and Tim3 pathways enhanced the growth, proliferation, and cytokine production of WT1-specific CD8+  T cells. In conclusion, our data suggests that targeting TIGIT, PD1, and Tim3 pathways may be important in reversing immune escape in patients with advanced gastric cancer."

Resections showing major pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy, defined as ≤10% residual viable tumor (RVT), may predict improved long-term patient outcome. However, %RVT calculations were developed in  the context of chemotherapy (%cRVT). An immune-related %RVT (%irRVT) has yet to be developed. Patients and methods: The first trial of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, NCT02259621) was just reported. We analyzed hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides  from the post-treatment resection specimens of the 20 patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma who underwent definitive surgery. Pretreatment tumor biopsies and preresection radiographic 'tumor' measurements were also assessed. Results: We found that the regression bed (the area of immune-mediated tumor clearance) accounts for the previously noted discrepancy between CT imaging and pathologic assessment of residual tumor. The regression bed is characterized by (i) immune activation-dense tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with macrophages and tertiary lymphoid structures; (ii) massive tumor cell death-cholesterol clefts; and (iii) tissue repair-neovascularization and proliferative fibrosis (each feature enriched in major pathologic responders versus nonresponders, P < 0.05).  This distinct constellation of histologic findings was not identified in any pretreatment specimens. Histopathologic features of the regression bed were used  to develop 'Immune-Related Pathologic Response Criteria' (irPRC), and these criteria were shown to be reproducible amongst pathologists. Specifically, %irRVT had improved interobserver consistency compared with %cRVT [median per-case %RVT  variability 5% (0%-29%) versus 10% (0%-58%), P = 0.007] and a twofold decrease in median standard deviation across pathologists within a sample (4.6 versus 2.2, P = 0.002). irPRC may be used to standardize pathologic assessment of immunotherapeutic efficacy. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine irPRC reliability as a surrogate for recurrence-free and overall survival."

DESIGN: - This pilot study investigates the respective PD-L1 kit assay staining patterns and related scoring of tumor cells and immune cells on lung carcinoma and melanoma. Furthermore, the influence of the detection method (platform and related reagents) on PD-L1 antibody performance is studied. - The SP142 kit reveals more immune cell staining but less tumor cell staining than the other PD-L1 kits. Alternatively, the 22C3 and 28-8 kits show good tumor cell sensitivity, but less pronounced immune cell staining, even in tonsil. Tumor cell staining by the SP263 kit is comparable to that of 22C3 and 28-8 kits, while immune cell staining is better. Strikingly, the selection of the detection method has a major impact on the sensitivity of the assay for PD-L1 detection per cell type. Switching the detection method of the kits could largely circumvent the observed staining differences. - The diverse sensitivities caused by the choice of the detection method should be taken into consideration when selecting PD-L1 kits or developing PD-L1 IHC laboratory-developed tests. When using alternative kits or laboratory-developed tests, it is strongly recommended to reestablish their clinical utility per therapeutic agent or compare them with the original kit."

Twenty-six had compassionate access to nivolumab (24 lung, one renal, one gastroesophageal with  possible new lung primary). Median overall survival was 5.7 months. Eleven (23%)  achieved a partial response; none had complete response. Twenty (43%) had disease progression on first imaging; 16 (48%) of these continued treatment beyond radiological progression, with three achieving subsequent partial responses. Ten  (21%) were not re-staged mostly due to rapid deterioration or death. At 6 and 12  months, nine (20%) and two (4%) remained on treatment, respectively.

We show in an autochthonous mouse model of SCLC that combined anti-VEGF/anti-PD-L1-targeted therapy synergistically improves treatment outcome  compared with anti-PD-L1 and anti-VEGF monotherapy. Mice treated with anti-PD-L1  alone relapsed after 3 weeks and were associated with a tumor-associated PD-1/TIM-3 double-positive exhausted T-cell phenotype. This exhausted T-cell phenotype upon PD-L1 blockade was abrogated by the addition of anti-VEGF-targeted treatment. We confirmed a similar TIM-3-positive T-cell phenotype in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with SCLC with adaptive resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment. Mechanistically, we show that VEGFA enhances coexpression of the inhibitory receptor TIM-3 on T cells, indicating an immunosuppressive function of VEGF in patients with SCLC during anti-PD-1-targeted treatment. Our data strongly suggest that a combination of anti-VEGF and anti-PD-L1 therapies can be an effective treatment strategy in patients with SCLC.Significance: Combining VEGF and PD-L1 blockade could be of therapeutic benefit to patients with small cell lung cancer."

To examine the clinical benefits of these agents, preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted to identify definitive biomarkers associated with cancer status. Analysis of the blood and feces of tumor patients has attracted attention in recent studies attempting to identify non-invasive biomarkers such as cytokines, soluble PD-L1, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and gut microbiota. These factors are believed to interact with each other to produce synergistic effects and contribute to the formation of the tumor immune microenvironment through the seven steps of the cancer immunity cycle. The immunogram was first introduced as a novel indicator to define the immunity status of cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the  progress in the identification of predictive biomarkers as well as future prospects for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy."

Despite advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of nsclc, the survival rate for this malignancy is still poor. It is now understood that, to evade detection and immune clearance, nsclc tumours overexpress the immunosuppressive checkpoint protein programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with monoclonal antibodies has significantly changed the treatment landscape in nsclc during the last 5 years. Despite evidence of clinical response in some patients, only approximately 20% of patients obtain any durable benefit, and many of the patients who do respond ultimately relapse with drug-resistant disease. The identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from such therapy is therefore important. In the present review, we cover the basics of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and its clinical significance in nsclc, biomarkers that are predictive of treatment response, relevant clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade completed to date, and proposed mechanisms of acquired therapeutic resistance."

We review our provision of this service at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust and the role of rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE) with the increasing demand for molecular markers in this era of personalized medicine. A review of the changes in the Endoscopy clinic over the 7 years from the introduction of EBUS at the end of 2010 until 2017 was carried out. This included the availability of material obtained for diagnosis, accurate subtyping, and molecular testing. We also assessed the success of molecular genetics DNA techniques from EBUS material versus formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE). A total of 1218 EBUS cases with ROSE were reported between 2011 and 2017 Percentage diagnostic rates were calculated as 83, 82, 84, 92, 93, 94, and 92 for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Availability of material for immunocytochemistry ranged from 86 to 100% over the 7 years. Molecular testing was successfully performed for EGFR in 89-100% of requested cases and ALK testing in 87-100% of requested cases. EBUS sourced material gave on average twice the amount of DNA and fewer amplicon repeats per patient compared to FFPE material. CONCLUSION: ROSE at EBUS FNA provides access to suitable material for molecular testing with increased yields in the form of needle washings for EGFR with FFPE materials for ALK and PDL1 testing."

Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a high-affinity human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and CD80, blocking PD-L1, but not PD-L2. Areas covered: In advanced NSCLC patients, durvalumab has demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability, particularly with ≥25% PD-L1 tumor expression in the EGFR and ALK wild-type population. However, preliminary data have shown lower efficacy in EGFR mutant and ALK-positive patients. The results from the recent PACIFIC study in locally advanced patients have placed durvalumab as standard of care in consolidation after chemoradiation, leading to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Expert commentary: Early data suggest promising activity for durvalumab with the  CTLA-4 inhibitor tremelimumab, regardless of PD-L1 expression, and potentially in combination with other drugs such as platinum-doublet chemotherapy. However, treatment-related toxicity associated with the combinations is an important aspect of the benefit-risk evaluation in the decision-making process. Results of  ongoing phase III trials will provide illuminating data to confirm the place of durvalumab in the management of NSCLC patients."

Here, we constructed a MUC1 and survivin (MS) combination gene tumor vaccine expressing MS fused with soluble PD-1 (sPD1/MS). To investigate whether the sPD1/MS fusion vaccine could enhance tumor-specific immune responses, its immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity were examined after  intramuscular immunization in mice. Compared with the MS DNA vaccine, the specific cytolysis rate of the sPD1/MS fusion DNA vaccine was increased from 21.64% to 34.77%. Moreover, the sPD1/MS vaccine increased the tumor suppression rate from 17.18% to 30.96% and prolonged survival from 6.96% to 19.44% in a murine colorectal cancer model. Combining the sPD1/MS vaccine with oxaliplatin improved the tumor suppression rate to 74.71% in the murine colorectal cancer model. The sPD1/MS vaccine could also exert a good anti-tumor effect, increasing  the tumor infiltrated CD8+ T cells by 6.5-fold (from 0.10% to 0.65%) in the murine lung cancer model. In conclusion, the sPD1/MS vaccine showed good immunogenicity and anti-tumor effect by activating lymphocytes effectively."

However, the proposed genotype that sensitizes these patients to immunotherapy is not captured by MSI status alone. Estimation of tumor mutational burden (TMB) from comprehensive genomic profiling is validated against whole exome sequencing and linked to checkpoint response in metastatic melanoma, urothelial bladder cancer and non-small cell lung carcinoma. We sought to explore the subset of microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC patients with  high TMB, and identify the specific genomic signatures associated with this phenotype. Furthermore, we explore the ability to quantify TMB as a potential predictive biomarker of PD1/PD-L1 therapy in CRC. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections from 6,004 cases of CRC were sequenced with a CLIA-approved CGP assay. MSI and TMB statuses were computationally determined using validated methods. The cutoff for TMB-high was defined according to the lower bound value that satisfied the 90% probability interval based on the TMB distribution across all MSI-High patients. Results: MSS tumors were observed in 5,702 of 6,004 (95.0%) cases and MSI-H tumors were observed in 302 (5.0%) cases. All but one (99.7%) MSI-H cases were TMB-high (range, 6.3-746.9 mut/Mb) and 5,538 of 5,702 (97.0%) MSS cases were TMB-low (range, 0.0-10.8 mut/Mb). Consequently, 164 of 5,702 (2.9%) MSS cases were confirmed as TMB-high (range, 11.7-707.2 mut/Mb), representing an increase in the target population that may respond to checkpoint inhibitor therapy by 54%  (466 vs. 302, respectively). Response to PD-1 inhibitor is demonstrated in MSS/TMB-high cases. Concurrent TMB assessment accurately classifies MSI tumors as TMB-high and simultaneously identifies nearly 3% or CRC as MSS/TMB-high. This subgroup may expand the population of CRC who may benefit from immune checkpoint  inhibitor based therapeutic approaches."

However, little is known about how quickly anti-PD-1 agents agents reach eligible patients in practice or whether such patients differ from those studied in clinical trials that lead to FDA approval (pivotal clinical trials). Objectives: To assess the speed with which anti-PD-1 agents agents reached eligible patients in practice and to compare the ages of patients treated in clinical practice with the ages of those treated in pivotal clinical trials. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study, performed from January 1, 2011, through August 31, 2016, included patients from the Flatiron Health Network who were eligible for anti-PD-1 agents treatment of selected cancer types, which included melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Cumulative proportions of eligible patients receiving anti-PD-1 agents treatment and their age distributions. Results: The study identified 3089 patients who were eligible for anti-PD-1 agents treatment (median age, 66 [interquartile range, 56-75] years for patients  with melanoma, 66 [interquartile range, 58-72] years for patients with RCC, and 67 [interquartile range, 59-74] years for patients with NSCLC; 1742 male [56.4%]  and 1347 [43.6%] female; 2066 [66.9%] white). Of these patients, 2123 (68.7%) received anti-PD-1 agents treatment, including 439 eligible patients with melanoma (79.1%), 1417 eligible patients with NSCLC (65.6%), and 267 eligible patients with RCC (71.2%). Within 4 months after FDA approval, greater than 60% of eligible patients in each cohort had received anti-PD-1 agents treatment. Overall, similar proportions of older and younger patients received anti-PD-1 agents treatment during the first 9 months after FDA approval. However, there were significant differences in age between clinical trial participants and patients receiving anti-PD-1 agents treatment in clinical practice, with more patients being older than 65 years in clinical practice (range, 327 of 1365 [60.6%] to 46 of 72 [63.9%]) than in pivotal clinical trials (range, 38 of 120 [31.7%] to 223 of 544 [41.0%]; all P < .001). Anti-PD-1 agents rapidly reached patients in clinical  practice, and patients treated in clinical practice differed significantly from patients treated in pivotal clinical trials. Future actions are needed to ensure  that rapid adoption occurs on the basis of representative trial evidence."

A retrospective cohort of early-stage surgically-treated NSCLC patients  enrolled in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Staging Project was created, and tissue Microarrays (TMAs) were constructed with  tumor and non-tumor lung tissue. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) proteins (transketolase [TKT] and transketolase-like 1 [TKTL1]), inflammatory markers (cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], interleukin 1 beta [IL1β], nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells [NFκB]-p65 and antigen Ki-67), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) were measured by immunohistochemistry. NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were included in the study (n = 199). TKT and TKTL1 were significantly higher in ADC than in non-tumor tissue (p < 0.001). Higher values were also observed in NSCLC for all the inflammatory markers, with figures >30% above those of non-tumor tissue (p < 0.001). PDL1 analysis showed a higher percentage of positivity in ADC than in non-tumor tissue (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling confirmed that high IL1β level in tumor tissue was  independently associated with 3-year mortality in NSCLC [HR = 2.05, 95% CI (1.1-3.7), p = 0.019], a relationship driven by ADC subtype.

Recent studies suggest that p53 also participates in the regulation of cellular immune responses. Here, we have investigated the potential of p53 gene therapy to augment immune checkpoint inhibition by combining an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) antibody with SGT-53, our investigational nanomedicine carrying a plasmid encoding human wild-type p53. In three syngeneic mouse tumor models examined including a breast  cancer, a non-small cell lung carcinoma, and a glioblastoma, SGT-53 sensitized otherwise refractory tumors to anti-PD1 antibody. The involvement of p53 in enhancing anti-PD1 immunotherapy appears to be multifaceted, since SGT-53 treatment increased tumor immunogenicity, enhanced both innate and adaptive immune responses, and reduced tumor-induced immunosuppression in a 4T1 breast tumor model. In addition, SGT-53 alleviates a fatal xenogeneic hypersensitivity associated with the anti-PD1 antibody in this model. Our data suggest that restoring p53 function by SGT-53 is able to boost anti-tumor immunity to augment  anti-PD1 therapy by sensitizing tumors otherwise insensitive to anti-PD1 immunotherapy while reducing immune-related adverse events."

Recent studies have reported an important role of PD‑L1 in mediating immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, increasing research has indicated that the expression of PD‑L1 is related to the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, but the related mechanisms remain to be explored. In the present study, we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of PD‑L1 expression during the EMT process in NSCLC cells treated with transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). The phenotypic alteration associated with EMT was evaluated by western blotting and confirmed by a wound‑healing assay. The results revealed that EMT markedly promoted the expression of PD‑L1 in the A549 cell line, while having no obvious influence on the H1650 and H1975 cells. Furthermore, the AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002, the ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059 and the TAK1 pathway inhibitor 5Z‑7 inhibited the expression of PD‑L1 in A549 and H1650 cells, but not in H1975 cells, during the EMT process. Moreover, our study indicated that the AKT, ERK and TAK1 pathways regulated the expression of PD‑L1 by mediating transportation of the transcription factor Stat3 and the p65 subunit of NF‑κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, with such findings determined by western blotting and flow cytometric analyses. Furthermore, the expression of PD‑L1 was significantly increased following treatment with gefitinib in a tumor xenograft model. In summary, our results support the role of ERK, AKT and TAK1 in mediating the expression of PD‑L1 during the EMT process, and indicate a promising strategy of PD‑L1‑targeted therapy for the clinical treatment of NSCLC."

The objective of this study was to examine age-related differences in patient-reported symptoms and functional domains in patients with advanced lung cancer receiving immunotherapy drugs. Three randomized controlled trials of anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapy in patients with advanced non-small  cell lung cancer that included patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were identified.  Baseline PRO data were pooled for treatment arms from 2 trials that included the  same PRO tools. Age-related differences in baseline mean scores for each of the health-related quality of life functional and symptom scales were assessed for patients ≥70 years and <70 years. Mean change from Baseline at 3 months was also  calculated and plotted for each age group. The adequacy of PRO assessments was assessed by comparing clinician-reported AE data in the 3 trials to the item content of the PRO tools included. Across the 3 trials, 75 of patients were under 70 and 26% patients were  70 and older. Comparing baseline scores in the 2 trials with the same PRO tool, older adults reported small differences including lower physical functioning, less pain, insomnia and financial difficulties, and higher social functioning than younger patients at baseline. No large differences in the distributions of mean change from baseline in function or symptom were identified. Several common  clinician-reported symptomatic AEs were not assessed by the PRO strategy employed in the 3 trials. Three clinician-reported symptomatic AEs (rash, fever, and pruritus) that were commonly reported in the safety data (9%-19%) were not assessed using the PRO tools employed. CONCLUSION: While several small differences were seen, there did not appear to be large differences at baseline or in the distributions of change from baseline in  PRO functional domains between younger and older patients with lung cancer undergoing anti-programmed death receptor -1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapy. Relevant symptomatic side effects were not assessed by PRO measures in these trials, and this is a limitation of current PRO assessment strategies."

Retrospective analyses pooling data across 4 randomized clinical trials  comparing programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) to docetaxel for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with disease progression on or after a platinum-containing therapy were conducted. Demographics, efficacy, and safety data from these trials were pooled and aggregated based on age. The relative treatment effects on overall survival (OS)  across age groups were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. A meta-analysis  was performed comparing OS across age groups treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies compared with those treated with docetaxel, as a common control arm across trials. A Cox Proportional Hazards model, stratified by clinical trial, was used and a univariate and multivariate adjusted analysis of OS to further identify trends in efficacy across age groups. Among patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies enrolled across the 4 clinical trials, 42% were >65 years of age, 99% had ECOG performance status of 0-1, 75% had received 1 prior therapy, and 76% were diagnosed with Stage IV disease. In the pooled analysis of 2,824 patients across both arms, the  treatment effects in age-defined subgroups were similar, with a hazard ratios (HR), unadjusted or adjusted, for OS of 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.63, 0.80) in patients <65 years and 0.66 (0.57, 0.76) in patients ≥65 years of age. In patients ≥70 years, the HR for OS was 0.67 (0.55. 0.82) and in patients ≥ 75 years, the HR was 0.81 (0.58, 1.13). Estimated median OS in patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies versus docetaxel was 14.5 months versus 8.8 months in patients <65 years, 14.2 months versus 9 months in patients ≥65 years, 14.1 versus 9.2 months in patients ≥70 years, and 14.7 versus 9.5 months in the patients ≥75years. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events with PD-1/PD-L1  blocking antibodies were less frequent in patients ≥75 years (23%) compared to patients> 65 year ( 49%) and <65 years (47%), as were serious adverse events (30%, 32.5%, 15%); however, treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment (7%, 7%, and 5%) in those subgroups ≤65 years, >65 years, and >75 years, respectively, were similar. Patients 65 and older with advanced and metastatic NSCLC, including  those ≥75 years, seem to derive similar survival benefits from treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies as patients <65 years of age. Patients 75 and older enrolled on these trials appear to tolerate PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies  and have a lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events compared to the subgroup of patients <65 years of age."

However, these agents are associated with immune-related side effects, the most common of which are endocrinopathies, colitis, hepatitis, and interstitial pneumonitis. In contrast,  coronary toxicities are rarely reported and remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the case of a patient who developed an acute coronary syndrome when treated with nivolumab as second-line therapy for metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma. A review of the literature, the French pharmacovigilance registry, and the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database led to the identification of four cases of patients with coronary manifestations attributable to anti-PD1 immunotherapy (with no reported cases of patients undergoing anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy), which we describe herein. The potential mechanisms causing adverse coronary reactions to this type of therapy, which is used to treat lung cancer as well as other solid and hematological neoplastic diseases, are also discussed."

In previous studies, PD-1 was found only expressed on the surface of immune cells, such as T cells and B cells  while PD-1's ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 were found expressed in some tumor cells. However, recent studies revealed intrinsic expression of PD-1 in melanoma and some other cancers. In melanoma cells, PD-1 can be activated by its ligand PD-L1  expressed by tumor cells, modulating downstream mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and promoting tumor growth independent of adaptive immunity. In addition to melanoma, PD-1 was also detected in liver cancer cells as well as in  non-small lung cancer cells. Unlike its oncogenic functions in melanoma and hepatic carcinoma cells, PD-1 seemed to play a distinct role in lung cancer, as blockade of PD-1 instead promoted tumor cells proliferation. Tumor-intrinsic PD-1 expression seems to be widespread in many tumor types, according to our reanalysis on cancer transcriptomic and proteomic data. The multifaceted roles of PD-1 in tumor cells beyond immune checkpoint signaling may explain the differential therapeutic effects of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 drugs and provide crucial information when developing combinatorial approaches to enhance antitumor immunity."

Both antibodies targeting the checkpoint inhibitory molecules programmed death receptor 1 (PD1),  PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic lymphocyte activated antigen 4 (CTLA4), as well as bispecific antibodies targeting CD3 and CD19 are now part of the standard of care. In particular, antibodies to checkpoint molecules have gained broad approval in a number of solid tumor indications, such as melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer based on their unparalleled efficacy. In contrast, the efficacy  of bispecific antibody-derivatives is much more limited and evidence is emerging  that their activity is regulated through diverse checkpoint molecules. In either  case, both types of compounds have their limitations and most patients will not benefit from them in the long run. A major aspect under investigation is the lack of baseline antigen-specific T cells in certain patient groups, which is thought  to render responses to checkpoint inhibition less likely. On the other hand, bispecific antibodies are also restricted by induced T cell anergy. Based on these considerations, combination of bispecific antibody mediated on-target T cell activation and reversal of anergy bears high promise. Here, we will review current evidence for such combinatorial approaches, as well as ongoing clinical investigations in this area. We will also discuss potential evidence-driven future avenues for testing."

A potential role for PD-L1 testing in identifying patients that are more likely to respond to treatment is emerging. PD-L1 expression in clinical practice is determined by testing one tumor section  per patient. Therefore, it is critical to understand the impact of tissue sampling variability on patients' PD-L1 classification. Resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and urothelial carcinoma (UC) tissue samples (five samples per  tumor type) were obtained from commercial sources and two tumor blocks were taken from each. Three sections from each block (~ 100 μm apart) were stained using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay, and scored based on the percentage of PD-L1-staining tumor cells (TCs) or tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) present. Each section  was categorized as PD-L1 high or low/negative using a variety of cut-off values,  and intra-block and intra-case (between blocks of the same tumor) concordance (overall percentage agreement [OPA]) were evaluated. An additional 200 commercial NSCLC samples were also analyzed, and intra-block concordance determined by scoring two sections per sample (≥70 μm apart). Concordance in TC PD-L1 classification was high at all applied cut-offs. Intra-block and intra-case OPA for the 15 NSCLC, HNSCC or UC samples were 100% and 80-100%, respectively, across all cut-offs; intra-block OPA for the 200 NSCLC samples was 91.0-98.5% across all cut-offs. IC PD-L1 classification was less consistent; intra-block and intra-case OPA for the 15 NSCLC, HNSCC or UC samples  ranged between 70 and 100% and between 60 and 100%, respectively, with similar observations in the intra-block analysis of the 200 NSCLC samples. These results show the reproducibility of TC PD-L1 classification across the depth of the tumor using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay. Practically, this means that treatment decisions based on TC PD-L1 classification can be made  confidently, following analysis of one tumor section. Although more variable than TC staining, consistent IC PD-L1 classification was also observed within and between blocks and across cut-offs."

Various studies have been initiated to explore the effectiveness of atezolizumab among different patient cohorts and disease statuses, including as first-line therapy. The purpose of this paper is to identify and summarize the trials that use atezolizumab as a first-line agent in  chemotherapy-naïve patients with NSCLC. Methods: A database search was performed  on Pubmed, Embase, and Wiley Cochrane Library-Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify clinical trials using atezolizumab as first-line therapy in NSCLC. Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) were searched to identify relevant clinical trials. Conference abstracts from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Society for Medical Oncology, and the American Association for Cancer Research were hand-searched. Any trial in which atezolizumab was used as first-line therapy in chemotherapy-naive patients with NSCLC was included. Results: Fifteen  studies were ultimately included, all of which are current and ongoing. Of the 15 studies, 5 have reported results. When given in the first-line setting, atezolizumab had higher rates of objective response, progression-free survival, and overall survival, compared to the second and third-line settings. Among the 15 studies, atezolizumab is used as monotherapy (n = 5), in combination with chemotherapy (n = 6), in combination with targeted therapy such as bevacizumab (n = 1), as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy (n = 3), in combination with stereotactic body radiation therapy (n = 1), and in combination with or following chemoradiation (n = 1). Available evidence shows promising safety and efficacy with the use of atezolizumab as first-line therapy in NSCLC. Atezolizumab is currently being studied in a variety of treatment settings. If clinical benefits are shown, atezolizumab may deem to be a useful first-line agent in NSCLC."

With cure rates of up to 90%, HL is one of the most curable cancers worldwide. Approximately 10% of people with HL will be refractory to initial treatment or will relapse; this is more common in people with advanced stage or bulky disease. Standard of care for these people is high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), but only  55% of participants treated with high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT are free from treatment failure at three years, with an overall survival (OS) of about 80% at three years.Checkpoint inhibitors that target the interaction of the programmed death (PD)-1 immune checkpoint receptor, and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, have shown remarkable activity in a wide range of malignancies. Nivolumab is an anti-(PD)-1 monoclonal antibody and currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and, since 2016, for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) after treatment with ASCT and brentuximab vedotin. To assess the benefits and harms of nivolumab in adults with HL (irrespective of stage of disease). SEARCH We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, conference proceedings and six study registries from January 2000 to May 2018 for prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospectively planned trials evaluating nivolumab in adults with HL. We excluded trials in which less than 80% of participants had  HL, unless the trial authors provided the subgroup data for these participants in the publication or after we contacted the trial authors. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed potential risk of bias. We used the software RobotReviewer to extract data and compared results with our findings. As we did not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs, we did not meta-analyse data. MAIN Our search found 782 potentially relevant references. From these, we included three trials without a control group, with 283 participants. In addition, we identified 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are  randomised. Risk of bias of the three included studies was moderate to high. All  of the participants were in relapsed stage, most of them were heavily pretreated  and had received at least two previous treatments, most of them had also undergone ASCT. As we did not identify any RCTs, we could not use the software RobotReviewer to assess risk of bias. The software identified correctly that one  study was not an RCT and did not extract any trial data, but extracted characteristics of the other two studies (although also not RCTs) in a sufficient way.Two studies with 260 participants evaluated OS. After six months, OS was 100% in one study and median OS (the timepoint when only 50% of participants were alive) was not reached in the other trial after a median follow-up of 18 months (interquartile range (IQR) 15 to 22 months) (very low certainty evidence, due to  observational trial design, heterogenous patient population in terms of pretreatments and various follow-up times (downgrading by 1 point)). In one study, one out of three cohorts reported quality of life. It was unclear whether  there was an effect on quality of life as only a subset of participants filled out the follow-up questionnaire (very low certainty evidence). Three trials (283  participants) evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) (very low certainty evidence). Six-month PFS ranged between 60% and 86%, and median PFS ranged between 12 and 18 months. All three trials (283 participants) reported complete response rates, ranging from 12% to 29%, depending on inclusion criteria and participants' previous treatments (very low certainty evidence).One trial (243 participants) reported drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) only after  a median follow-up of 18 months (IQR 15 to 22 months); these were fatigue (23%),  diarrhoea (15%), infusion reactions (14%) and rash (12%). The other two trials (40 participants) reported 23% to 52% grade 3 or 4 AEs after six months' follow-up (very low certainty evidence). Only one trial (243 participants) reported drug-related serious AEs; 2% of participants developed infusion reactions and 1% pneumonitis (very low certainty evidence).None of the studies reported treatment-related mortality. AUTHORS' To date, data on OS, quality of life, PFS, response rate, or short- and long-term AEs are available from small uncontrolled trials only. The three trials included heavily pretreated participants, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. For these participants, median OS was not reached after follow-up times of at least 16 months (more than 50% of participants with a limited life expectancy were alive at this timepoint). Only one cohort out of three only reported quality of life, with limited follow-up data so that meaningful conclusions were not possible. Serious adverse events occurred rarely. Currently, data are too sparse to make a clear statement on nivolumab for people with relapsed or refractory HL except for heavily pretreated people, which had previously undergone regimens of BV or ASCT. When interpreting  these results, it is important to consider that proper RCTs should confirm these  findings.As there are 14 ongoing trials evaluating nivolumab, of which two are RCTs, it is possible that an update of this review will be published in the near  future and that this update will show different results to those reported here."

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the early immune responses to therapy remain poorly understood. Through an integrated analysis of  early-stage NSCLC patients and a Kras mutant mouse model, we show a prevalent programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis exemplified by increased intratumoral PD-1+ T cells and PD-L1 expression. Notably, tumor progression was associated with spatiotemporal modulation of the immune microenvironment with dominant immunosuppressive phenotypes at later phases of tumor growth. Importantly, PD-1 inhibition controlled tumor growth, improved overall survival, and reprogrammed tumor-associated lymphoid and myeloid cells. Depletion of T lymphocyte subsets demonstrated synergistic effects of those populations on PD-1 inhibition of tumor growth. Transcriptome analyses revealed T cell subset-specific alterations corresponding to degree of response to the treatment. These results provide insights into temporal evolution of the phenotypic effects of PD-1/PD-L1 activation and inhibition and motivate targeting of this axis early in lung cancer progression."

However, attempts to use the drug as a single agent have achieved only limited clinical success. To further enhance the clinical benefits  of monotherapy, combination therapies will likely be necessary. Cytokine-induced  killer (CIK) cells are a heterogeneous subset of ex vivo expanded T lymphocytes that have been shown to prolong the survival of cancer patients. We are conducting a study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor in combination with CIK cells in relapsed/refractory MRCC and NSCLC and to analyze potential biomarkers to predict which patients will benefit most from the combined therapy. Case presentation: The results of two patients treated in an ongoing clinical trial for MRCC and NSCLC are described here. The tumor biopsy from Patient 1 exhibited moderate CD3+ T cell infiltration, but no PD-1 or PD-L1 expression. The tumor cells from Patient 2 strongly expressed PD-L1, and there was extensive tumor infiltration by CD3+ T cells; however, no PD-1 staining was seen. Non-synonymous single nucleotide variant (nsSNVs), along with higher indel mutations, in Patient 1 and nsSNVs along with higher tumor mutation burden in Patient 2 correlate with tumor-infiltrating CD3+ lymphocyte density. Patient 1 achieved a complete response, and Patient 2 achieved a near-complete response. A PD-1 inhibitor in combination with CIK cells led to potent antitumor activity in MRCC and NSCLC; CD3+ T cell infiltration in baseline tumor  biopsies is a potential predictive biomarker. This approach is being further investigated in an ongoing phase I trial."

Once activated, ATR acts  via its downstream target to arrest the cell cycle, promote DNA repair, and enhance cell survival. Therefore, ATR has become an attractive therapeutic target in cancer therapy. Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated that ATR inhibitors can sensitize cancer cells to conventional DNA damaging agents. However, the potential effects of ATR inhibitors on immune response in the tumor  microenvironment, especially on the expression of immune checkpoint-related proteins, remain elusive. Here we show that DNA damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation and cisplatin, significantly induce cell surface PD-L1 expression in various cancer cell types. This effect is blocked by depletion or pharmacological inhibition of ATR, suggesting the essential role of ATR in DNA damage-induced PD-L1 expression. Mechanistically, we show that disruption of ATR destabilizes PD-L1 in a proteasome-dependent manner. Furthermore, clinical ATR kinase inhibitor downregulates PD-L1 expression to attenuate PD-L1/PD-1 interaction and  sensitize cancer cells to T cell killing. Collectively, our findings indicate that in addition to potentiating DNA damage, ATR inhibitor concurrently downregulates PD-L1 levels and enhances anti-tumor immune responses. Moreover, our data reveal a potential crosstalk between DNA damage response signaling and immune checkpoints, providing a rationale for the combination therapy of ATR inhibitor and immune checkpoint blockade."

In order to determine the subset of patients that can benefit most from these therapies, biomarkers such as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have been proposed. However, the predictive and prognostic role of the use of PD-L1 is controversial. Anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry may not represent the actual status of the tumour because of individual variability and tumour heterogeneity. Additionally, there may be analytical variability due to the use of different assays and antibodies to detect PD-L1. Moreover PD-L1 expression is also regulated by oncogenic drivers in NSCLC, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) fusion with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS).

We previously reported that STK11/LKB1 (KL) or TP53 (KP) comutations define distinct subgroups of KRAS-mutant LUAC. Here, we examine the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in these subgroups. Objective response rates to PD-1 blockade differed significantly among KL (7.4%), KP (35.7%), and K-only (28.6%) subgroups (P < 0.001) in the Stand Up To Cancer (SU2C) cohort (174 patients) with KRAS-mutant LUAC and in patients treated with nivolumab in the CheckMate-057 phase III trial  (0% vs. 57.1% vs. 18.2%; P = 0.047).

The impact of STK11/LKB1 alterations on clinical outcomes with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors extended to PD-L1-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

In this study, we report a progressive decrease of NFATc1 in lung tumor tissue and in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) of patients suffering from advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mice harboring conditionally inactivated NFATc1 in T cells (NFATc1ΔCD4)  showed increased lung tumor growth associated with impaired T-cell activation and function. Furthermore, in the absence of NFATc1, reduced IL2 influenced the development of memory CD8+ T cells. We found a reduction of effector memory and CD103+ tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells in the lung of tumor-bearing NFATc1ΔCD4 mice, underlining an impaired cytotoxic T-cell response and a reduced  TRM tissue-homing capacity. In CD4+ICOS+ T cells, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)  was induced in the draining lymph nodes of these mice and associated with lung tumor cell growth. Targeting PD-1 resulted in NFATc1 induction in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumor-bearing mice and was associated with increased antitumor cytotoxic functions. This study reveals a role of NFATc1 in the activation and cytotoxic functions of T cells, in the development of memory CD8+ T-cell subsets, and in the regulation of T-cell exhaustion. These data underline the indispensability of NFATc1 for successful antitumor immune responses in patients with NSCLC.Significance: The multifaceted role of NFATc1 in the activation and function of T cells during lung cancer development makes it a critical participant in antitumor immune responses in patients with NSCLC."

This result is mostly related to the availability in clinical practice  of checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands  (PD-Ls) immunosuppressive pathway. Although patient's selection in the first-line setting relies essentially on high levels of PD-L1 tumor expression, treatment choice in pretreated patients is more challenging and, although clinical and biological characteristics might be of help, there is an urgent need for novel tools to better identify sensitive and resistant patients. In this context, the integration of molecular markers and immune-PET imaging might represent a potentially effective strategy to refine patient selection."

The role of sex in ICI trials has been overlooked. How sex correlates with ICI efficacy is incompletely understood. Clinical trials evaluating ICI versus other therapies in male and female patients were included. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of overall  survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were used. Six thousand and ninety-six patients from 11 trials were included. More improvement of OS was observed in males (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.53-0.71; p < 0.001) treated with ICI versus controls than females (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65-0.84; p < 0.001). ICIs improved PFS more in males (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.71; p < 0.001) than females  (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52-0.91; p < 0.001). The sex difference had more effect on the overall survival in melanoma patients versus NSCLC patients. Overall survival of patients treated with CTLA-4 inhibitor was more influenced by sex variable compared with PD-1 inhibitors. A significant sex-related efficacy difference was  observed between female and male melanoma patients. Although male patients had longer OS and PFS than females when treated with ICIs versus controls, the difference was not significant. Sex difference should be more considered in future clinical trials, guidelines and clinical practice."

We investigated the outcomes of PD-1 pathway inhibitors and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from lung  cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of non-small-cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases consecutively treated with PD-1 pathway inhibitors and SRS at our institution from 2012 to 2017. Overall survival (OS), distant brain failure (DBF), and local control (LC) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression models. We identified 37 patients treated with SRS to 85 lesions (90.6% intact and 9.4% resected) and a median total of 7 doses of PD-1 pathway inhibitors (83.8% nivolumab, 10.8% atezolizumab, 5.4% pembrolizumab). Most lesions were treated with 18 Gy in a single fraction (n = 61; 71.8%). Patients treated with concurrent SRS and PD-1 pathway inhibitors had longer OS and reduced rates of DBF compared with patients treated with SRS before or after PD-1 pathway inhibitor therapy (1-year OS, 87.3% vs 70.0% vs 0%, P = .008; 1-year DBF, 38.5% vs 65.8% vs 100%, P = .042). LC was favorable among lesions treated with SRS concurrent with  or after PD-1 pathway inhibitor therapy compared with before PD-1 pathway inhibitor therapy (1-year LC, 100% vs 72.3%, P = .016). Three lesions transiently enlarged after SRS and then had partially or completely resolved on follow-up imaging. Four patients required steroids for SRS-associated toxicity. No patient  experienced grade ≥ 4 toxicity. Concurrent treatment with SRS and PD-1 pathway inhibitors was associated with favorable OS and locoregional disease control. This combination of therapy was well tolerated and merits further evaluation in larger cohorts in  a prospective setting."

The aim of this study was to determine the changes in PD-L1 expression of tumor cells (TC) and immune cells (IC), in PD-1 expression of IC, and in the amount of stromal mononuclear cell infiltration after platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with  lung cancer. We determined the amount of stromal mononuclear cells and  PD-L1/PD-1 expressions by immunohistochemistry in bronchoscopic biopsy samples including 20 adenocarcinomas (ADC), 15 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 2 other types of non-small cell lung cancer, and 4 small cell lung cancers together with  their corresponding surgical resection tissues after platinum-based chemotherapy. PD-L1 expression of TC decreased in ten patients (24.4%) and increased in three patients (7.32%) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.051). The decrease in PD-L1 expression, however, was significant only in patients who received cisplatin-gemcitabine combination (p = 0.020), while in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group, no similar tendency could be observed (p = 0.432).  There was no difference between ADC and SCC groups. Neither PD-1 expression nor the amount of stromal IC infiltration showed significant changes after chemotherapy. This is the first study, in which both PD-L1 and PD-1 expression were analyzed together with the amount of stromal IC infiltration in different histological subtypes of lung cancer before and after platinum-based chemotherapy. Our results confirm that chemotherapy decreases PD-L1 expression of TC in a subset of patients, therefore, rebiopsy and re-evaluation of PD-L1 expression may be necessary for the indication of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy."

Therefore, the safety of PD-1 and PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in patients with NSCLC and underlying AID is currently unknown. Methods As part of a multi-institutional effort, we retrospectively collected clinicopathologic data from patients with NSCLC and a history of AID who received monotherapy with either a PD-1 or a PD-L1 (herein referred to as PD-[L]1) inhibitor. Qualifying AIDs included but were not limited  to: rheumatologic, neurologic, endocrine, GI, and dermatologic conditions. Results We identified 56 patients with NSCLC and an AID who received a PD-(L)1 inhibitor. At the time of treatment initiation, 18% of patients had active AID symptoms and 20% were receiving immunomodulatory agents for their AID. A total of 55% of patients developed an AID flare and/or an immune-related adverse event (irAE). Exacerbation of the AID occurred in 13 patients (23% of the whole cohort), four of whom required systemic corticosteroids. Immune-related adverse events occurred in 21 patients (38%). Among irAEs, 74% were grade 1 or 2 and 26%  were grade 3 or 4; eight patients required corticosteroids for irAE management. PD-(L)1 therapy was permanently discontinued in eight patients (14%) because of irAEs. The overall response rate to immunotherapy in this population was 22%. Conclusion In patients with NSCLC with AID treated with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor, exacerbation of AID occurred in a minority of patients. The incidence of irAEs was similar to reported rates in clinical trials where patients with AID were excluded. Adverse events were generally manageable and infrequently led to permanent discontinuation of immunotherapy."

It is important to evaluate the practicality of PD-L1 testing in real-world practice. A total of 211 non-small cell lung cancer patients were enrolled to detect 5 driver mutations and PD-L1 status (22C3 and SP263 assays) and to evaluate the characteristics of PD-L1 expression and its predictive value  of immunotherapy. The PD-L1 positive (≥1%) and strong positive (≥50%) rate by SP263 assay was 27.0% and 12.8%. The concordance rates between 2 PD-L1 assays while using 1%, 10%, 25%, and 50% positive tumor cells as the cutoffs were 76.8%, 81.5%, 90.5%, and 94.3%, respectively. Smokers and patients without known actionable driver mutation were more likely to present strong positive PD-L1 [adjusted hazard ratio, 5.00 (95% confidence interval-CI, 1.60-15.64); P=0.006 and 3.59 (95% CI, 1.25-10.33); P=0.018, respectively]. Higher levels of smoking were associated with higher PD-L1 expressions. None of the EGFR, ALK, HER2, or BRAF-mutant nonsmokers displayed strong positive PD-L1 expression by SP263 assay. Among patients undergoing PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors therapy, high PD-L1 expression by SP263 was associated with a longer progression-free survival [adjusted hazard ratio, 0.15 (95% CI, 0.03-0.71); P=0.017]. In conclusion, our results suggest that PD-L1 status remains an important predictor of immunotherapy efficacy. The concordance between 22C3 and SP263 assays was greater at a higher cutoff level of positivity. Patients without known actionable driver mutation, along with smokers, particularly those having high smoking pack-years, were more  likely to have strong PD-L1 expression."

Here we have determined the real-world incidence of radiologic pseudoprogression in advanced NSCLC and compared radiologic response criteria for assessment of disease response. The electronic medical records of all patients with NSCLC who were receiving anti-PD-1 therapy at our institution over a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed, and patients with clinically suspected radiologic pseudoprogression were identified. Patients without available follow-up imaging or clinical data were excluded. Imaging examinations were then analyzed to determine whether progression was confirmed on subsequent reimaging. Assessments  of tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), the unidimensional immune-related response criteria (iRRC), and the iRECIST criteria for all patients were performed and compared. A total of 228 consecutive patients began receiving anti-PD-1 therapy over a 3-year period. Of the 166 of these patients who were evaluable, most (80%) received nivolumab. Fifteen patients (9%) were clinically suspected of having radiologic pseudoprogression on account of tumor enlargement and/or development of new lesions on computed tomography images during the first 4 to 6 weeks of therapy, and they continued receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. Three of these patients  (2%) demonstrated evidence of radiologic pseudoprogression at first reimaging. The iRRC and immune RECIST criteria were more accurate in classifying radiologic  pseudoprogression as nonprogression; none of the three cases were deemed progression by the iRRC or immune RECIST, whereas all three cases were determined to be progression according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,  version 1.1. Radiologic pseudoprogression is a clinical challenge but an uncommon occurrence in patients with NSCLC who are receiving anti-PD-1 therapy."

In lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), specific thyroxin kinase inhibitors against EGFR mutations and ALK fusions are used as a standard treatment regimen and show significant positive efficacy. On the other hand, targeted therapy against driver gene aberrations has not been adapted yet in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This is because driver genes and druggable aberrations are rarely  identified by next generation sequencing in SCLC. Recent advances in the understanding of molecular biology have revealed several candidate therapeutic targets. To date, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP), enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) or delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3 (DLL3) are considered to be druggable targets in SCLC. In addition, another candidate of personalized therapy for SCLC is immune blockade therapy of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its  ligand, PD-L1. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy is not a standard therapy for SCLC, so many clinical trials have been performed to investigate its efficacy. Herein, we  review gene aberrations exploring the utility of targeted therapy and discuss blockade of immune checkpoints therapy in SCLC."

High PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was associated to improved overall survival (OS) in KRAS mutant patients (p = 0.012), but not in the WT population (p = 0.385), whereas increased PD-L1 expression in immune cells correlated to poor OS of KRAS-WT patients (p = 0.025), with no difference in patients with KRAS mutations. KRAS mutational status can affect the immune microenvironment and survival of LADC patients in a heterogeneous way, implying that specific mutant KRAS variants expressed by the tumor should be considered when stratifying patients for immunotherapy."

Expression of TIM-3 and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), and density of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in resected lung adenocarcinoma. The association between clinicopathological features or clinical outcomes and TIM-3 expression was analyzed. A total of 223 patients were enrolled.

However, it remains unknown whether T cells in human cancer adopt a similar spectrum of exhausted states based on PD-1 expression levels. We compared transcriptional, metabolic and functional signatures of intratumoral CD8+ T lymphocyte populations with high (PD-1T), intermediate (PD-1N) and no PD-1 expression (PD-1-) from non-small-cell lung cancer patients. PD-1T T cells showed a markedly different transcriptional and metabolic profile from PD-1N and PD-1- lymphocytes, as well as an intrinsically high capacity for tumor recognition. Furthermore, while PD-1T lymphocytes were impaired in classical effector cytokine production, they produced CXCL13, which mediates immune cell recruitment to tertiary lymphoid structures. Strikingly, the presence of PD-1T cells was strongly predictive for both response and survival in a small cohort of non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with PD-1 blockade. The characterization of a distinct state of tumor-reactive, PD-1-bright lymphocytes in human cancer, which only partially resembles that seen in chronic infection, provides potential avenues for therapeutic intervention."

The trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02519062). From January 2010 to May 2014, 44 patients (male : female=33 : 11; median age: 69.5 years), referred to our Institution for NSCLC resection, were enrolled. Tumor specimens were assessed for HIF-1α, CD68-TAMs, CD8-TILs, PD-1-TILs, and PD-L1 expressions. All patients underwent fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) PET before surgery. Semiquantitative parameters included maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUVpeak, SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis, whereas for heterogeneity, we considered tumor sphericity, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, and energy. Parameters were correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) considering a median  follow-up of 22.7 months. SUVmax (cutoff: 7.9; P=0.015), SUVpeak (cutoff: 6.7; P=0.013), SUVmean (cutoff: 5.5; P=0.028), metabolic tumor volume (cutoff: 3.6 cm; P=0.027), and entropy (cutoff: 1.89; P=0.045) showed a statistically significant association with DFS. Also, a high expression of cytoplasmic HIF-1α (score 3) was associated  with DFS (hazard ratio: 0.09; P=0.003). All F-FDG PET variables differed significantly in tumors with high or low entropy (≤1.89). Also, a significantly higher level of mean CD8-TILs was observed in tumors with higher entropy (P=0.041).Using identified prognostic factors, we developed a scoring system, which was confirmed to be associated with DFS (P<0.004). On receiver operating characteristics analysis, a score above 3 was defined as the optimal cutoff point. CONCLUSION: Tumor heterogeneity, metabolic parameters, and high expression of hypoxia were found to be prognostic factors in NSCLC patients who were candidates for surgery. Higher levels of entropy appear to be associated with increased density of CD8-TILs. The combination of investigated prognostic factors enabled the development of a potential scoring system associated with DFS."

Anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) and anti-PD-L1 antibodies (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved for treatment of several other advanced malignancies, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); renal cell, and urothelial carcinoma; head and neck cancer; gastric, hepatocellular, and Merkel-cell carcinoma; and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In some of these malignancies approval was based on the detection of biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression or high microsatellite instability. Methods: We review the current status of prognostic and predictive biomarkers used in ICI for melanoma and other malignancies. We include clinical, tissue, blood, and stool biomarkers, as well as imaging biomarkers. Results: Several biomarkers have been studied in ICI for metastatic melanoma. In  clinical practice, pre-treatment tumor burden measured by means of imaging and serum lactate dehydrogenase level is already being used to estimate the likelihood of effective ICI treatment. In peripheral blood, the number of different immune cell types, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils, as well as different soluble factors, have been correlated with clinical outcome. For intra-tumoral biomarkers, expression of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 has been found  to be of some predictive value for anti-PD-1-directed therapy for NSCLC and melanoma. A high mutational load, particularly when accompanied by neoantigens, seems to facilitate immune response and correlates with patient survival for all  entities treated by use of ICI. Tumor microenvironment also seems to be of major  importance. Interestingly, even the gut microbiome has been found to correlate with response to ICI, most likely through immuno-stimulatory effects of distinct  bacteria. New imaging biomarkers, e.g., for PET, and magnetic resonance imaging are also being investigated, and results suggest they will make early prediction  of patient response possible. Several promising results are available regarding possible biomarkers for response to ICI, which need to be validated in large clinical trials. A better understanding of how ICI works will enable the development of biomarkers that can predict the response of individual patients."

Microfluidic devices have emerged as valuable tools for both mechanistic studies and for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic agents, due to their ability to precisely control drug concentrations and gradients of oxygen and other species in a scalable and potentially high throughput manner. Most existing in vitro microfluidic cancer models are comprised of cultured cancer cells embedded in a physiologically relevant matrix, collocated with vascular-like structures. However, the recent emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) as a powerful therapeutic modality against many cancers has created a need for preclinical in vitro models that accommodate interactions between tumors and immune cells, particularly for assessment of unprocessed tumor fragments harvested directly from patient biopsies. Here we report on a microfluidic model, termed EVIDENT (ex vivo immuno-oncology dynamic environment for tumor biopsies), that accommodates up to 12 separate tumor biopsy fragments interacting with flowing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a dynamic microenvironment. Flow control is achieved with a single pump in a simple and scalable configuration, and the entire system is constructed using low-sorption materials, addressing two principal concerns with existing microfluidic cancer models. The system sustains  tumor fragments for multiple days, and permits real-time, high-resolution imaging of the interaction between autologous TILs and tumor fragments, enabling mapping  of TIL-mediated tumor killing and testing of various ICI treatments versus tumor  response. Custom image analytic algorithms based on machine learning reported here provide automated and quantitative assessment of experimental results. Initial studies indicate that the system is capable of quantifying temporal levels of TIL infiltration and tumor death, and that the EVIDENT model mimics the known in vivo tumor response to anti-PD-1 ICI treatment of flowing TILs relative  to isotype control treatments for syngeneic mouse MC38 tumors."

Latest clinical trials have depicted the difference in  the effectiveness of programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in smokers and nonsmokers. However, the lack of statistical power in these trials prevented a final conclusion. The authors postulated that the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors correlated with smoking status. Materials and methods: Clinical trials evaluating PD-1 inhibitors versus chemotherapies in smokers and nonsmokers were included. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free  survival (PFS) were used. Results: A total of 1,981 patients from three Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly prolonged the OS (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.78) and PFS (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.43-0.67; P = 0.027) in smoking patients versus chemotherapy. However, among nonsmoking patients, no significant improved OS and PFS were observed compared with chemotherapy. PD-1 inhibitors were more efficacious in smoking NSCLC patients compared with chemotherapy. No better survival of nonsmoking patients was observed in the treatment of PD-1 inhibitors than chemotherapy.

Eligible randomised control trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors, antiangiogenic therapy, and doublet platinum-based therapy published up to July 2017 were comprehensively analysed. Through the indirect comparison analysis of 37 trials involving 16810 patients, treatments were compared for overall survival (OS) and grade 3-5 adverse events. For first-line treatment, the use of pembrolizumab alone (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-0.91) and a combination of bevacizumab and doublet platinum-based therapy (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75-0.99) demonstrated substantial survival benefits compared with doublet platinum-based therapy. For subsequent treatment, nivolumab may provide higher efficacy and lower toxicity than antiangiogenic therapy. Overall,  anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies may be superior to antiangiogenic therapy in terms of OS and grade 3-5 adverse events. This meta-analysis suggests that pembrolizumab and nivolumab might be favourable choices for first-line and subsequent treatment, respectively, for patients with advanced NSCLC.

Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors represents a major  advancement in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Therapy against programed cell  death-1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) is associated with a significant improvement in overall survival in stage IV disease, and these results have led to a great interest in evaluating these agents in earlier-stage  NSCLC. The preliminary data from ongoing trials suggest that the integration of checkpoint blockage into the treatment of early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC  is safe, tolerable, and has the potential to improve outcomes without adding substantial toxicity. In the current review, we provide an overview of the emerging data on the role of PD-1/PD-L1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors in the treatment of early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC, with a focus on ongoing clinical trials and combination strategies."

Patients and Methods: This meta-analysis included randomized trials comparing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies with chemotherapy. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS) for the trial population and prespecified subgroups were extracted. We calculated pooled estimates of treatment efficacy using the fixed-effects or random-effects model when appropriate. All statistical tests were two sided. Results: Seven trials involving 3871 patients were included. The pooled results showed that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy significantly prolonged OS (HR: 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63  to 0.84) and PFS (HR: 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.99) compared to chemotherapy.

They are diagnosed at an earlier age with more advanced disease. Programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitor, Nivolumab, was approved as a second-line agent after failure of platinum-based therapy for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The original studies leading to the approval of Nivolumab had insufficient AA patients, thus there is still inadequate knowledge on treatment outcomes among AA patients. Our primary study endpoints were to determine the median overall survival, 1-year overall survival  rate, median progression-free survival, and 1-year progression-free survival rate of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer on Nivolumab.  Our secondary study endpoints were to determine the overall tumor response rate,  median time to response, median duration of response, and incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4. In this retrospective study, we reviewed the charts of 38 patients, 29 of which were AA, with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who received Nivolumab from March 1, 2015 until November 30, 2017 from a single community-based cancer center and compared our results with historical data. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histology (71%) among all patients. Seven (18%) continued to use Nivolumab while 21 (55%) discontinued the  treatment mainly due to progression of the disease. The median overall survival was 21.4 months (95% CI 13.5-27.4) and 17.6 months (95% CI 11.5-27.6) for all the patients and AA, respectively. Both have statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) compared to the historical studies of Borghaei et al. and Brahmer et  al. At 1 year, the overall survival rate was 73% (95% CI 50-86) and 66% (95% CI 40-82) for all patients and AA, respectively. The median progression-free survival was also statistically significant (P < 0.001) between all the patients  6.3 months (95% CI 2.8-8), AA 6.0 months (95% CI 2.3-8.0), and the said historical studies. The 1-year progression-free survival rate was 23% (95% CI 10-39) and 28% (95% CI 12-47) for all patients and AA, respectively. Overall tumor response rate which includes complete and partial responses was 21% (95% CI 10-37) and 24% (95% CI 10-43) for all patients and AA, respectively. The median time to response was 3 and 2.8 months for all patients and AA, respectively. The  median duration of response was 3.8 and 4.0 months for all patients and AA, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 8 and 10% in all patients and AA, respectively, similar to the rates previously shown. AA patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC on Nivolumab had increased overall survival and progression-free survival with similar grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events. Providing adequate access to immunotherapy is indispensable to maximize survival benefit for AA patients."

ICI have revolutionized patients care with lung cancer. Nevertheless, restoring endogenous antitumor T-cell responses can induce immune related adverse events, such as sarcoidosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report here the first case of a thoracic and cutaneous sarcoid-like reaction in a patient with a relapsing unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 mAb. The expression of PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, was assessed by flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and compared to patients who had discontinued nivolumab therapy without having developed any immune related adverse events. PD-L1 expression was transiently increased on B cells, T cells and monocytes, whereas PD-L2 expression was not modulated. PD-1 was transiently undetectable when PD-L1 was maximal, before returning to basal level. Sarcoidosis spontaneously resolved, without corticotherapy. CONCLUSION: This case sheds the light on a complex regulation of PD-L1 expression in vivo on PBMC after nivolumab arrest and triggers the question of monitoring the expression of immune checkpoint on immune cells during and after treatment with ICI."

Antibodies targeting two negative immune checkpoint pathways, namely cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), have been approved first for patients with melanoma, squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma. Clinical trials are ongoing to verify the efficiency of these antibodies for other cancer types and to evaluate strategies to block other checkpoint molecules. However, a number of patients do  not respond to this treatment possibly due to profound immunosuppression, which is mediated partly by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). This heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells can strongly inhibit anti-tumor activities of T and NK cells and stimulate regulatory T cells (Treg), leading to tumor progression. Moreover, MDSC can contribute to patient resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the frequency and  immunosuppressive function of MDSC in cancer patients can be used as a predictive marker for therapy response. This review focuses on the role of MDSC in immune checkpoint inhibition and provides an analysis of combination strategies for MDSC targeting together with ICI to improve their therapeutic efficiency in cancer patients."

We report 5-year follow-up results from an early phase I study of nivolumab in this patient population and describe  characteristics of 5-year survivors. Patients and Methods Patients with pretreated, advanced NSCLC received nivolumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in  8-week cycles for up to 96 weeks. OS from the time of first dose was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results The estimated 5-year OS rate was 16% for all treated patients (N = 129); 5-year OS rates were similar for squamous (16%) and nonsquamous (15%) NSCLC. Of 16 5-year survivors, most (88%) were known current or former smokers. Of 10 5-year survivors with quantifiable PD-1 ligand 1 expression, 70% had ≥ 1% PD-1 ligand 1 expression at baseline. Twelve 5-year survivors (75%) achieved a partial response to nivolumab per Response Evaluation  Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.0, and two each (12%) had stable disease and  progressive disease as best response. Nine 5-year survivors (56%) completed the maximum 96 weeks of nivolumab; four (25%) discontinued owing to adverse events and three (19%) owing to disease progression. As of a November 2016 database lock, 12 5-year survivors (75%) received no subsequent therapy and were without evidence of progressive disease at last follow-up. Conclusions Nivolumab treatment resulted in long-term OS and durable responses in a proportion of patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC. Long-term survivors had diverse baseline and on-treatment characteristics."

However, there is still a large fraction of patients that do not respond to checkpoint inhibitors, and the challenge remains to find cellular and molecular cues that could predict which patients would benefit from these therapies. Using a series of qualitative and quantitative methods we show here that PBMCs and platelets from smokers and patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) or lung cancer express and up-regulate PD-L1 independently of tumor stage. Furthermore, treatment with Atezolizumab, a fully humanised monoclonal antibody against PD-L1, in 4 patients with lung cancer caused a decrease in PD-L1 expression in platelets, which was restored over 20 days. Altogether, our findings reveal the expression of the main therapeutic target in  current checkpoint therapies in human platelets and highlight their potential as  biomarkers to predict successful therapeutic outcomes."

Liquid biopsies provide noninvasive prognostic markers such as circulating tumor DNA and RNA. Circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA) in blood is also used to identify mutations in genes of interest, but additionally, provides information about relative expression levels of important genes. In this study, we analyzed PD-L1 expression in ctRNA isolated from various cancer types. Tumors inhibit antitumor response by modulating the immune checkpoint proteins programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its cognate receptor PD1. The expression of these genes has been implicated in evasion of immune response and resistance to targeted therapies. Blood samples were collected from gastric (GC), colorectal (CRC), lung (NSCLC), breast (BC), prostate cancer (PC) patients, and a healthy control group. ctRNA was purified from fractionated plasma, and following reverse transcription, levels of PD-L1 expression were analyzed using qPCR. PD-L1 expression was detected in the plasma ctRNA of all cancer types at varying frequencies but no PD-L1 mRNA was detected in cancer-free individuals. The frequencies of PD-L1 expression were significantly different among the various cancer types but the median relative PD-L1 expression values were not significantly different. In 12 cases where plasma and tumor tissue were available from the same patients, there was a high degree of concordance between expression of PD-L1 protein in tumor tissues and PD-L1 gene expression in plasma, and both methods were equally predictive of response to nivolumab. PD-L1 mRNA can be detected and quantitated in ctRNA of cancer patients. These results pave the way for further studies aimed at determining whether monitoring the levels of PD-L1 mRNA in blood can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from the conventional treatment."

However, the immunological profile of non-small cell lung carcinoma  (NSCLC) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is not yet fully characterized, and it may be therapeutically important. The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize and quantify PD-L1/PD-1 expression and tumor-associated immune cells (TAICs) in surgically resected NSCLCs from patients who received NCT or did not receive NCT (non-NCT). We analyzed immune markers in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues resected from 112 patients with stage II/III NSCLC, including 61 non-NCT  (adenocarcinoma [ADC] = 33; squamous cell carcinoma [SCC] = 28) and 51 NCT (ADC = 31; SCC = 20). We used multiplex immunofluorescence to identify and quantify immune markers grouped into two 6-antibody panels: panel 1 included AE1/AE3, PD-L1, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD68; panel 2 included AE1/AE3, PD1, granzyme  B, FOXP3, CD45RO, and CD57. PD-L1 expression was higher (> overall median) in NCT cases (median, 19.53%) than in non-NCT cases (median, 1.55%; P = 0.022). Overall, density of TAICs was higher in NCT-NSCLCs than in non-NCT-NSCLCs. Densities of CD3+ cells in the tumor epithelial compartment were higher in NCT-ADCs and NCT-SCCs than in non-NCT-ADCs and non-NCT-SCCs (P = 0.043). Compared with non-NCT-SCCs, NCT-SCCs showed significantly higher densities of CD3 + CD4+ (P = 0.019) and PD-1+ (P < 0.001) cells in the tumor epithelial compartment. Density of CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was higher in NCT-NSCLCs than in non-NCT-NSCLCs and was significantly higher in NCT-SCCs than in non-NCT-SCCs. In  NCT-NSCLCs, higher levels of epithelial T lymphocytes (CD3 + CD4+) and epithelial and stromal TAMs (CD68+) were associated with better outcome in univariate and multivariate analyses. NCT-NSCLCs exhibited higher levels of PD-L1 expression and T-cell subset regulation than non-NCT-NSCLCs, suggesting that NCT activates specific immune response mechanisms in lung cancer. These results suggest the need for clinical trials and translational studies of combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy prior to surgical resection of locally advanced NSCLC."

In this study, we generated a novel self-delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) (sdRNA) that knocked down PD-1 expression on healthy donor T cells as well as patient-derived tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). We have developed an alternative chemical modification of RNA backbone for improved stability and increased efficacy. Our results show that T cells treated with sdRNA specific for PD-1 had increased interferon γ (IFN-γ) secreting capacity and that this modality of gene expression interference could be utilized in our rapid expansion protocol for production of TIL for therapy. TIL expanded in the presence of PD-1-specific  sdRNA performed with increased functionality against autologous tumor as compared to control TIL.

PD-L1 immunohistochemistry is the current biomarker assay used for patient selection, but still imprecise in predicting therapy response. Exploring  this issue, we performed computational tissue analysis of PD-L1 immunostaining in procured NSCLC tissues (n = 50) using the Merck KGaA anti-PD-L1 clone MKP1A07310. Staining patterns and PD-L1 cut-off points were interrogated using relevant cancer immune-surveillance biomarkers. Groups with high PD-L1 expression levels (above 25/50% staining cut-off points) were enriched for a biomarker profile in the tumor-nest and microenvironment indicating escape from host-immunity, as represented by increased numbers of cells positive for CD8 and Granzyme B (immune-effectors), FOXP3 (immune-suppressive), and CD68 (P < 0.05). Manual analysis of PD-L1 staining patterns identified tumors with an immune-induced reactive pattern relevant for immunotherapy that would ordinarily be excluded by  the arbitrary 25% staining threshold (P < 0.05). Conversely, some cases with completely or predominantly immune-independent constitutive PD-L1 staining patterns that indicate insensitivity to immunotherapy may have been incorrectly selected using this staining cut-off point criterion. Therefore, we propose differentiation of reactive vs constitutive PD-L1 staining patterns to improve the accuracy of this biomarker assay in selecting NSCLC patients for PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy."

However, even in patients with favorable effects, therapeutic efficacy does not last long. Recently, retreatment with anti-PD-1 antibody has received attention.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retreatment with pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients previously treated with nivolumab. We retrospectively reviewed NSCLC patients retreated with pembrolizumab who were previously treated with nivolumab. We collected the following data: patient characteristics, number of cycles of nivolumab and pembrolizumab, treatment interval between nivolumab and pembrolizumab, best response, and immune-related adverse events. Twelve patients were reviewed. The median number of cycles of nivolumab  was 12.5 (range 2-32 cycles). Seven patients (58.3%) achieved a partial response  (PR) and two patients (16.7%) achieved stable disease (SD). Eight patients (66.7%) received cytotoxic chemotherapy between nivolumab and pembrolizumab. The  median number of cycles of chemotherapy treatment was 4 (range 1-9 cycles). The median number of cycles of pembrolizumab was 3.5 (range 1-17 cycles). One patient (8.3%) achieved PR and four patients (33.3%) achieved SD as their best response to pembrolizumab. All patients showing response to pembrolizumab had very high (≥ 80%) tumor PD-Ligand 1 expression. This study suggested that retreatment with anti-PD-1 antibody is a reasonable option for selected NSCLC patients."

The implication of PD-1-PD-L1 pathway in the context of NK cells and/or macrophages in OS is unknown. We investigated the effect of anti-PD-1 in OS lung metastasis and the role of NK cells and/or macrophages in anti-PD-1 responses. A human LM7 OS mouse model was used. Immunohistochemistry for tissues (PD-L1, caspase-3, Ki-67, NK cells, macrophages), and Western blotting for OS lung tumors (p-Stat3,  p-Erk1/2) was performed. NK and macrophages were assessed using flow cytometry. NK cell and macrophage depletion were conducted using anti-asialo GM1 and clodrosome, respectively. PD-L1 expression was observed in human OS cells and OS  patient lung metastases. Anti-PD1 antibody led to a significant decrease in the number of OS lung metastases, enhanced tumor apoptosis, decreased tumor cell proliferation, and p-STAT-3/p-Erk1/2 signaling blockade in OS lung tumors. NK cells and macrophages in OS lung tumors expressed PD-1 and anti-PD1 increased NK  cell and macrophage tumor infiltration. Increased numbers of antitumor M1 macrophages and decreased pro-inflammatory M2 macrophages were seen. NK depletion did not affect therapeutic effect of anti-PD-1, suggesting that NK cells were not directly involved. However, macrophage depletion significantly compromised anti-PD1 efficacy, confirming their role in efficacy of anti-PD-1 against OS lung metastasis. Our findings suggest that OS lung metastases regression by anti-PD1 can be attributed to activated tumor M1 macrophages and reduced M2 macrophages. Owing to the co-relation of M1 macrophages with OS patient outcome, we provide a  novel mechanism of PD-1 blockade and a basis for future clinical trials for anti-PD-1 antibodies in OS."

Blocking antibodies against programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) leads to robust local tumor control and a durable response in patients with various tumors that are refractory to standard treatments. Breast cancer was traditionally thought to be  poorly immunogenic and yield a relatively lower mutation burden compared to 'inflamed' tumors, including melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma. Accumulated results have demonstrated that higher T lymphocyte infiltration was observed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) breast cancer compared to estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative luminal breast cancer. Among molecular subtypes, single agent cancer immunotherapy showed the most promising results in TNBC. The development of immuno-oncology combinations is required to increase the clinical benefit of immunotherapy against breast cancer. Response to the immunotherapy depends on the dynamic interaction between tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. In the era of precise medicine, exploration of actual immune response and development of biomarkers is required to maximize the clinical benefit of cancer  immunotherapy."

B7-H3, an immune-checkpoint molecule, is expressed in various malignancies. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate B7-H3 expression in NSCLCs treated with anti-PD-1 therapy and the therapeutic potential of a combination of anti-PD-1 therapy and B7-H3 targeting.Experimental Design: B7-H3 expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in patients with NSCLC (n = 82), and its relationship with  responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was analyzed. The antitumor efficacy of dual anti-B7-H3 and anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody therapy was evaluated using a syngeneic murine cancer model. T-cell numbers and functions were analyzed by flow cytometry.Results: B7-H3 expression was evident in 74% of NSCLCs and was correlated critically with nonresponsiveness to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. A small  number of CD8+ TILs was observed as a subpopulation with PD-L1 tumor proportion score less than 50%, whereas CD8+ TILs were still abundant in tumors not expressing B7-H3. Anti-B7-H3 blockade showed antitumor efficacy accompanied with  an increased number of CD8+ TILs and recovery of effector function. CD8+ T-cell depletion negated antitumor efficacy induced by B7-H3 blockade, indicating that improved antitumor immunity is mediated by CD8+ T cells. Compared with a single blocking antibody, dual blockade of B7-H3 and PD-L1 enhanced the antitumor reaction.B7-H3 expressed on tumor cells potentially circumvents CD8+-T-cell-mediated immune surveillance. Anti-B7-H3 immunotherapy combined with  anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy is a promising approach for B7-H3-expressing NSCLCs."

However, assays for PD-L1 have been developed for individual agents, and they use different antibody clones, immunohistochemistry staining protocols, scoring algorithms, and cut-offs. Given that laboratories are unlikely to use multiple testing platforms, use of one PD-L1 assay in conjunction with a specific therapy  will become impractical and could compromise treatment options. Methods to harmonize testing methods are therefore crucial to ensuring appropriate treatment selection. This paper focuses on lung, bladder, and head-and-neck cancer. It reviews and compares available PD-L1 testing methodologies, summarizes the literature about comparability studies to date, discusses future directions in personalized diagnostics, and provides a pathologist's perspective on PD-L1 testing in the Canadian laboratory setting."

We evaluated if medical imaging procedures, used for anti-tumour response assessment, can detect  irAEs. All consecutive patients treated with anti-PD1 and with a  medical imaging acquisition performed within 2 weeks with irAEs ≥2 were retrospectively included. Data were gathered from June 2014 to February 2017, and a central review was performed. The primary and secondary end-points were i) to evaluate the overall detection rate of irAEs by medical imaging and ii) to provide a comprehensive radiological description of irAEs. Fifty-three patients (31 women, 22 men; average age: 61 years) were included. The primary tumour was melanoma (n = 32), lung cancer (n = 18) and other (n = 3). Patients were treated with nivolumab (n = 27) or pembrolizumab (n = 26). Of 74 medical imaging procedures analysed (ratio = 1.4 medical imaging  per patient), 55 irAE were detected.

Samples from 50 squamous cell carcinomas and 42 adenocarcinomas were subjected to immunofluorescence to detect blood and lymphatic vessels. CD3pos, CD8pos and PD-1pos tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumour PD-L1 expression were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis. Quantification of vascular structures documented a peak of lymphatics at the invasive margin together with a decreasing gradient of blood and lymphatic vessels from the peritumour area throughout the neoplastic core. Nodal involvement and pathological stage were strongly associated with vascularization, and an increased density of vessels was detected in samples with a higher incidence of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and a lower expression of PD-L1. Patients with a high PD-L1 to PD-1 ratio and vascular rarefaction had a gain of 10 months in overall survival compared to those with a low ratio and prominent vascularity. Microvessels are an essential component of the cancer immune microenvironment. The clinical impact of the PD-1/PD-L1-based immune contexture may be implemented by the assessment of microvascular density to potentially identify patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who could benefit from immunotherapy and antiangiogenic treatment."

Mice that received PD-1 KO LN cells had more CD8+ T-cell infiltration of the BM and greater expansion of H60-specific CD8+ T cells than did their B6 LN-infused counterparts. In the spleen, CD8+ T cells were skewed to an effector memory phenotype, suggesting accelerated differentiation of PD-1 KO T cells.

Defining PD-L1 expression at ≥ 1% tumor cells as positive, PD-L1-positive tumors showed a higher response rate. However, it is unclear whether 1% is the optimal cutoff, and studies on lung cancer suggested 50% cutoff as a stronger predictive biomarker. 96 primary SCCHN from oropharynx and oral cavity and 34 corresponding metastatic lesions were typed for membranous PD-L1 expression. p16 immunohistochemistry was used as a surrogate marker for HPV status in SCCHN from the oropharynx. Fifty-two of 96 (54%) tumors were PD-L1-positive, 72% if PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating immunocytes was also included as positive. Fifteen of 34 primary-metastasis tumor pairs differed  in PD-L1 expression, and p16(+) cases more frequently showed PD-L1 expression in  immunocytes than p16(-) cases (82 vs. 45%, p < 0.05). PD-L1-positive SCCHN showed two distinct patterns of expression. In the induced pattern of expression, PD-L1-positive tumor cells were limited to the periphery of tumor nests at the tumor-immunocyte interface, comprising < 5% of tumor cells, and were almost always associated with PD-L1-positive immunocytes. In contrast, tumors with constitutive PD-L1 expression had a higher percentage of positive tumor cells, often diffusely distributed throughout the tumor, and often were not accompanied  by PD-L1-positive immunocytes. We propose that distinguishing these two biologically distinctive patterns of PD-L1 expression and typing metastatic instead of primary lesions might better predict immunotherapeutic response to anti-PD1/PD-L1 regimens beyond just the percentage of PD-L1-positive tumor cells."

We report real-world use of this regimen in a single medical center. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study that includes patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed and treated with carboplatin/pemetrexed (Cohort A) or carboplatin/pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab (Cohort B) between January 1st, 2016 till December 15th, 2017. Objective response rate (ORR) was the primary endpoint. Progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) were the secondary endpoints. Results: A total of 54 patients were included (cohort A =37 vs. cohort B =17). ORR was 53.3% in cohort B vs. 40.5% in cohort A (P=0.41). DCR was significantly higher in cohort B (86.7% vs. 54%, P=0.02). PFS was also higher in cohort B (P= 0.009, HR 0.22). Similar proportion of patients had brain metastases in each cohort (A: 32.4% vs. B: 35.3%, P=0.83). ORR was higher in patients with brain metastases from cohort B (B: 80% vs. A: 58.3%, P=0.75). Significantly higher proportion of the patients with brain metastases progressed in cohort A (A: 91.7% vs. B: 33.3%, P=0.009). The combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed with pembrolizumab showed promising results in a real world setting in patients with NSCLC with and  without brain metastases that are in line with the reported results of phase II and III studies. Most significant benefit was observed in preventing progression  and achieving the disease control."

We sought to characterize clinical patterns of AR to PD-1 axis inhibitors in patients with advanced NSCLC,  and evaluate subsequent outcome and management strategies for such patients. Patients with NSCLC who developed AR to PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy initiated between December 2009 and February 2016 at one institution were identified and examined by clinical and radiographic features. AR was defined as  progressive disease after initial response by either Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 or immune-related response criteria. Twenty-six patients with AR to PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy were identified and evaluated. Median time to AR was 313 days; the 2-year survival rate from AR was 70% (95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.92). Twenty patients (77%)  experienced AR in lymph nodes (LNs), including 11 patients with LN-only progression. Twenty-three (88%) patients had recurrence limited to one (54%) or two (35%) sites of disease. Fourteen patients (54%) continued PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy beyond progression. Three patients were re-challenged with the same PD-1  axis inhibitor after holiday from and progression off therapy, 2 again responded. Fifteen patients (58%) received local therapy to site(s) of AR, 11 continued respective PD-1 axis inhibitor after local therapy. The 2-year survival rate from AR among these 15 patients was 92% (95% confidence interval: 0.77-1). Acquired resistance to PD-1 axis inhibitors is often limited to one  or two sites when local therapy and continuation of PD-1 axis inhibitor therapy can result in prolonged benefit. LN metastases appear to be particularly susceptible sites to AR. When progression of disease following response occurs after holiday from PD-1 axis inhibitor, re-challenge can again lead to tumor regression."

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the heterogeneity of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy between men and women. We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus, from database inception to Nov 30, 2017, for randomised controlled trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (inhibitors of PD-1, CTLA-4, or both) that had available hazard ratios (HRs) for death according to patients' sex. We also reviewed abstracts and presentations from all major conference proceedings. We excluded non-randomised trials and considered only papers published in English. The primary endpoint was to assess the difference in efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors between men and women, measured in terms of the difference in overall  survival log(HR) reported in male and female study participants. We calculated the pooled overall survival HR and 95% CI in men and women using a random-effects model, and assessed the heterogeneity between the two estimates using an interaction test. FINDINGS: Of 7133 studies identified in our search, there were 20 eligible randomised controlled trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab, tremelimumab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab) that reported overall survival according to patients' sex. Overall, 11 351 patients with advanced or metastatic  cancers (7646 [67%] men and 3705 [33%] women) were included in the analysis; the  most common types of cancer were melanoma (3632 [32%]) and non-small-cell lung cancer (3482 [31%]). The pooled overall survival HR was 0·72 (95% CI 0·65-0·79) in male patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, compared with men treated in control groups. In women treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the pooled overall survival HR compared with control groups was 0·86 (95% CI 0·79-0·93). The difference in efficacy between men and women treated with immune  checkpoint inhibitors was significant (p=0·0019). INTERPRETATION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors can improve overall survival for patients with advanced cancers such as melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, but the magnitude of benefit is sex-dependent. Future research should guarantee greater inclusion of women in trials and focus on improving the effectiveness of  immunotherapies in women, perhaps exploring different immunotherapeutic approaches in men and women.

Patient selection, currently based on PD-L1 expression on tumor tissue, is limited by its temporal and spatial heterogeneity. We hypothesized that liquid biopsy with PD-L1 analysis on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) might overcome this limitation. Blood samples were prospectively collected from patients with advanced NSCLC before nivolumab treatment and at the time of progression. CTCs were isolated using a cell size-based technology. PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunofluorescence on CTCs and immunohistochemistry on tissue biopsies. 113 specimens from 96 patients were collected. Baseline PD-L1 expression could be assessed on 72% and 93% of tissue and CTC, respectively. CTCs were more  frequently found to be PD-L1 positive than tissue (83% vs. 41%) and no correlation was observed between tissue and CTC PD-L1 expression (r = 0.04, p = 0.77). Pre-treatment high CTC number was associated with increased risk of death and progression (HR1.06, p = 0.03 for OS; HR1.05, p = 0.02 for PFS). The presence of pre-treatment PD-L1+CTC was not significantly correlated with outcomes but a higher baseline PD-L1+ CTC number (≥1%) was observed in the non-responders group (PFS <6 months) (p = 0.04) and PD-L1+CTC were seen in all  patients at progression. CONCLUSION: Assessment of PD-L1 expression in CTCs is feasible and CTCs are more  often positive than in tissue. Pre-treatment PD-L1+CTCs are associated with bad prognosis in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors."

Genomic intra-tumor heterogeneity at the exome level has been reported in many cancer types, but comprehensive gene expression intra-tumor heterogeneity has not been well studied. Here, we delineated the gene expression intra-tumor heterogeneity by exploring gene expression profiles of 35 tumor regions from 10 non-small cell  lung cancer tumors (three or four regions/tumor), including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung. Using Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST arrays, we generated the gene expression data  for every sample. Inter-tumor heterogeneity was generally higher than intra-tumor heterogeneity, but some tumors showed a substantial level of intra-tumor heterogeneity. The analysis of various clinically relevant gene expression signatures including molecular subtype, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and anti-PD-1 resistance signatures also revealed heterogeneity between different regions of the same tumor. The gene expression intra-tumor heterogeneity we observed was associated with heterogeneous tumor microenvironments represented by stromal and immune cells infiltrated. Our data suggest that RNA-based prognostic  or predictive molecular tests should be carefully conducted in consideration of the gene expression intra-tumor heterogeneity."

An effective immune response in this setting is due to surveillance of tumor-specific antigens that induce an adaptive immune  response resulting in T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically those targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) axis, have demonstrated promising activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there remains a crucial need for better treatment strategies for the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC, particularly in the frontline setting. Chemotherapy can increase antigenicity via immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells as well as also reduce off target immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Combining chemotherapy with PD-1 blockade harnesses the potential synergy between these agents and has led to encouraging results in the up-front treatment of NSCLC. In this review, we summarize the preclinical rationale behind these combinations and review recent trial data demonstrating their efficacy."

We retrospectively analyzed 687 NSCLC specimens (476 adenocarcinoma and 211 squamous cell carcinoma) using tissue microarray. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using Dako 22C3 pharmDx assay and PDL1 mRNA was measured using RNA in situ hybridization (RISH).  The overall prevalence of PD-L1 protein expression was 25.2% in tumor cells and PDL1 mRNA expression was 11.9%. There was a strong positive correlation between PD-L1 IHC and RISH results (Spearman's rho = 0.6, p<0.001). In adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 protein and mRNA expressions significantly correlated with poorly differentiated histologic subtype (p<0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). PD-L1 expression was also associated with genetic alteration in adenocarcinoma. High PD-L1 expression level was associated with EGFR-naïve and KRAS-mutant subgroup (p = 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively). With a 1% cut-off value, PD-L1 protein expression showed a short overall survival duration in early stage adenocarcinoma with marginal significance (p = 0.05, Hazard ratio = 1.947). Our study revealed that PD-L1 expression varied with histologic subtype and genomic alteration status in lung adenocarcinoma, and activation of the PD-L1 pathway may be a poor  prognostic factor especially in early stage lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, PDL1 RISH showed promising results in predicting PD-L1 protein expression in NSCLC."

However, we are only at the beginning of a new era from which we expect in the near future the use of immunotherapy in most patients as a first line treatment in substitution or in combination with chemotherapy. These strategies are now the objective of recent studies that have shown a benefit with the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with non-squamous histotype compared to chemotherapy alone or a benefit in patients selected for high mutational burden (TMB) with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA-4 compared to chemotherapy alone. However, there are many  questions regarding immunotherapy that should be considered in clinical practice  as: response evaluation, validation of predictive factors such as TMB potentially complementary to the expression of PD-L1, proper education of the patients and of the medical staff to prompt recognition and adequate management of toxicities.

This study is aimed at clarifying the prognostic  significance of PD-L1 expression in patients with surgically resected pulmonary metastases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A retrospective review was conducted of 26 HNSCC patients who underwent complete resection of pulmonary metastases. PD-L1 expression in both the primary and metastatic tumors was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (anti-PD-L1 antibody, clone SP263). High PD-L1 expression was defined as ≥50% of  tumor cells with positive staining. Survival and prognostic impacts following pulmonary metastasectomy were analyzed based on the PD-L1 expression level. The patients included 23 men and 3 women, with a median age of 65 years. Six (23%) of the pulmonary metastatic cases showed high PD-L1 expression, while their corresponding primary lesions had low PD-L1 expression. The 5-year overall  survival rate after pulmonary metastasectomy was 57.6% in all cases. The 5-year overall survival rates were 72.5% and 16.7% in the low and high PD-L1 groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high PD-L1 expression and older age (>65 years) correlated independently with a shorter overall survival (p < 0.001). High PD-L1 expression in pulmonary metastases could be an independent predictor of poor outcome in HNSCC patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy.

Patients received  nivolumab until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. The main aim of the study was to report the efficacy and safety profile of Nivolumab in pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC of our everyday clinical practice. The secondary aim was to perform subgroup analysis by clinical features. Results: From August of 2015 to January of 2017, 188 patients were enrolled. The  patients demographics were: median age 58 years, 144 male; 17 never smoker and 171 former/current smoker; 112 adenocarcinoma, 66 squamous-cell carcinoma and 10  not otherwise specified (NOS); 61 stage IIIB and 127 stage IV; 15 performance status (PS) 0, 154 PS 1 and 19 PS 2; 5 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and 1 anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK); 42 with central nervous system (CNS) metastases; and 71 received 2 or more prior therapy lines.

In recent years, inhibitory checkpoints, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), have been identified to suppress anti-tumor immune responses in solid tumors. Novel drugs targeting immune checkpoints have succeeded in cancer treatment. Specific PD-1 blockades were approved for treatment of melanoma in 2014 and for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer in  2015 in the United States, European Union, and Japan. Preclinical and clinical studies show immune checkpoint therapy provides survival benefit for greater numbers of patients with liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, two main primary liver cancers. The combination of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is being evaluated in phase 1, 2 or 3 trials, and the results suggest that an anti-PD-1 antibody combined with locoregional therapy or other molecular targeted agents is an effective treatment strategy for HCC. In addition, studies on activating co-stimulatory receptors to  enhance anti-tumor immune responses have increased our understanding regarding this immunotherapy in liver cancer. Epigenetic modulations of checkpoints for improving the tumor microenvironment also expand our knowledge of potential therapeutic targets in improving the tumor microenvironment and restoring immune  recognition and immunogenicity. In this review, we summarize current knowledge and recent developments in immune checkpoint-based therapies for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma and attempt to clarify the mechanisms underlying its effects."

Relapses are common despite treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Prospective data for treatment of ESCC are lacking; treatment of these cancers usually incorporates lung small cell carcinoma treatment recommendations. Cancer staging remains the most important prognostic factor. Cancer immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown efficacy in multiple tumor types, and could be an appealing treatment strategy for these rare tumors. We investigated PD-L1 expression by immunochemistry (IHC) in ESCCs diagnosed at University of Massachusetts Medical Center, from 1999 to 2016. 34 cases with sufficient material were selected for PD-L1 IHC analysis using clone E1L3N. PD-L1 expression was evaluated using the combined positive score (CPS). Retrospective chart review was performed. We evaluated the incidence and prognostic value of PD-L1 expression in ESCC at our institution. Twelve out 34 cases (35%) had PD-L1 CPS scores ≥1. Ten cases had CPS scores ranging 1-5, whereas 2 cases had CPS scores > 80. The overall response rate to the standard chemotherapy with/without radiotherapy in the PD-L1 positive group was 80% versus 67% for the PDL-1 negative group (p-value 0.67). The median  overall survival for the PD-L1 positive group, regardless of stage, was 11.5 months versus 7 months for PD-L1 negative group (p-value 0.34). Patients with limited stage disease with positive PD-L1 had a median survival of 53 months compared to 15 months for patients with PD-L1 negative limited stage (p-value 0.80). This study showed that at least one third of our ESCC tissue samples expressed PD-L1. There was a trend for higher response rates to the standard chemotherapy with/without radiotherapy and improved survival in PD-L1 positive patients. Further studies are required to understand the implications of immune dysregulation in these aggressive tumors. PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors should be investigated in this group of patients."

Nevertheless, although most ALK-driven tumors dramatically respond to ALK TKIs , all patients ultimately develop drug-resistant disease. Analysis of post-progression biopsy samples has provided invaluable insight into the mechanisms of resistance, now informing on subsequent therapeutic strategies. In particular, the identification of secondary ALK mutations, which are a common mechanism of resistance to both first-generation and to an even larger extent to second-generation ALK TKIs, may  shape a personalized optimal treatment strategy beyond the current first-line choice. Alectinib has now become a preferred treatment option in the first line of therapy, and extrapolation of data obtained from post-progression samples after second-line next-generation ALK TKIs suggests that acquired resistance is likely to be mediated in more than half of patients by ALK resistance mutations.  Nevertheless, clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that multiple resistance mechanisms may co-exist at different levels in the same TKI-resistant patient. Newer ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) overcome some resistance mutations through higher exposure and potency, and generally present greater CNS activity,  but are unlikely to overcome resistance mediated through separate oncogenic pathway activations, or epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation. Furthermore, while resistance mutations can be detected through commonly available sequencing methods, the identification of other mechanisms of resistance is much less straightforward in the clinic. We hypothesize that the ALK resistance mutation status will likely be crucially important in the choice of second-line therapy after a second-generation TKI. Emerging clinical data also refines the optimal placing of PD-1- and PD-L1-directed immunotherapy in the treatment sequence."

In this pilot study, we administered two preoperative doses of PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in adults with untreated, surgically resectable early (stage  I, II, or IIIA) NSCLC. Nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight)  was administered intravenously every 2 weeks, with surgery planned approximately  4 weeks after the first dose. The primary end points of the study were safety and feasibility. We also evaluated the tumor pathological response, expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), mutational burden, and mutation-associated, neoantigen-specific T-cell responses. Neoadjuvant nivolumab had an acceptable side-effect profile and was not  associated with delays in surgery. Of the 21 tumors that were removed, 20 were completely resected. A major pathological response occurred in 9 of 20 resected tumors (45%). Responses occurred in both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors. There was a significant correlation between the pathological response and the pretreatment tumor mutational burden. The number of T-cell clones that were found in both the tumor and peripheral blood increased systemically after PD-1 blockade in eight of nine patients who were evaluated. Mutation-associated, neoantigen-specific T-cell clones from a primary tumor with a complete response on pathological assessment rapidly expanded in peripheral blood at 2 to 4 weeks after treatment; some of these clones were not detected before the administration of nivolumab. Neoadjuvant nivolumab was associated with few side effects, did not  delay surgery, and induced a major pathological response in 45% of resected tumors. The tumor mutational burden was predictive of the pathological response to PD-1 blockade. Treatment induced expansion of mutation-associated, neoantigen-specific T-cell clones in peripheral blood.

For many patients with cancer, these agents have been shown to have substantial efficacy and favorable toxicity compared with cytotoxic agents, particularly in the second-line setting. With the advent of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, combination immunotherapy- and chemoimmunotherapy-based strategies have emerged as promising novel regimens to improve cancer-related outcomes. Older adults age 65 or older represent the growing majority of patients diagnosed with cancer. However, older adults are under-represented in clinical trials in general, as well as in the landmark studies that led to approval of these immunotherapy agents. Because of increasing age and attendant multimorbidity and impaired functional status, many of these patients seen in the community-based oncology practices would not have been considered eligible for such studies. Thus, the results of these studies are difficult to generalize to a broader patient population with these competing risks. Furthermore, robust evaluation of toxicities, effect on quality of life and functional status, and aging-related (i.e., immunosenescence) and immunotherapy-related changes affecting the immune system remain underexplored research areas for older adults. This review examines the role of immunotherapy and its unique issues, specifically in older adults with lung cancer, bladder cancer, and lymphomas."

After initial studies demonstrated survival advantage with these agents in patients with recurrent NSCLC, these agents now have demonstrated survival advantage in some patients with early-stage NSCLC. Further evaluation of these agents in combination with chemotherapy regimens and other checkpoint inhibitors is ongoing. Recent data suggest that addition of these agents to chemotherapy may improve survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Promising results have also been observed in patients with recurrent small cell lung cancer. Ongoing studies will define the role of these agents in the management of patients with small cell lung cancer. Tumor PD-L1 assessment has become standard of care since use of frontline pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC is based on tumor PD-L1 expression. Other biomarkers are being actively evaluated to identify the patients most likely to benefit from these agents. Unique adverse effects are observed with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Knowledge of the adverse effects and their management is crucial in treating patients with lung cancer using immune checkpoint inhibitors."

Checkpoint blockade has led to durable remissions in some patients, but may also induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Lung cancer patients show an increased risk for complications, when infected with influenza viruses. Therefore, vaccination is recommended. However,  the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination during checkpoint blockade and its influence on irAEs is unclear. Similarly, the influence of vaccinations on T  cell-mediated immune reactions in patients during PD-1 blockade remains poorly defined. We vaccinated 23 lung cancer patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls using a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine to investigate vaccine-induced immunity and safety during checkpoint blockade. We did not observe significant differences between patients and healthy  controls in vaccine-induced antibody titers against all three viral antigens. Influenza vaccination resulted in protective titers in more than 60% of patients/participants. In cancer patients, the post-vaccine frequency of irAEs was 52.2% with a median time to occurrence of 3.2 months after vaccination. Six of 23 patients (26.1%) showed severe grade 3/4 irAEs. This frequency of irAEs might be higher than the rate previously published in the literature and the rate observed in a non-study population at our institution (all grades 25.5%, grade 3/4 9.8%). Although this is a non-randomized trial with a limited number of patients, the increased rate of immunological toxicity is concerning. This finding should be studied in a larger patient population."

The therapeutic potential of immune-checkpoint inhibitors is exemplified by the recent hail of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals for their use in various malignancies. Continued efforts to enhance outcomes with immunotherapy agents have led to the formulation of advanced treatment strategies. Recent evidence from pre-clinical studies evaluating immune-checkpoint inhibitors in various cancer cell-lines has suggested that combinatorial approaches may have superior survival outcomes compared to single-agent immunotherapy regimens. Preliminary trials assessing combination therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4 immune-checkpoint inhibitors have documented considerable advantages in survival indices over single-agent immunotherapy. The therapeutic potential of combinatorial approaches is highlighted by the recent FDA approval of nivolumab plus ipilimumab for patients  with advanced melanoma. Presently, dual-immune checkpoint inhibition with anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed cell death receptor- ligand-1 (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) plus anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) is being evaluated for a wide range of tumor histologies. Furthermore, several ongoing clinical trials are investigating combination checkpoint inhibition in association with traditional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. In this review, we summarize the current landscape of combination therapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-CTLA-4 MoAbs for patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We present a synopsis of the prospects for expanding the indications of dual immune-checkpoint inhibition therapy to a more diverse set of tumor histologies."

In particular, we compared the rate of toxicities of concurrent versus sequential delivery of thoracic RT and checkpoint inhibitors. Methods and Materials: Patient and treatment characteristics were collected on all patients at our institution who were treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and/or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors and underwent thoracic RT (n = 79). Receiving both treatments within 1 month was considered concurrent (n = 35; 44%), and any treatment up to 6 months apart was considered sequential (n = 44; 56%). The primary endpoint of this study was the rate of Grade ≥2 AEs from combination therapy (immunotherapy and RT), specifically those that are relevant to thoracic RT: Pneumonitis, other pulmonary events, esophagitis, dermatitis, and fatigue. Further univariate analysis was performed to compare AE  rates with clinical and therapy-related variables. Results: A total of 79 patients were identified, with lung cancer (n = 45) and melanoma (n = 15) being the most common primary histology. Sixty-two (78%) patients were treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, 12 (15%) with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, and 5 (6%) received both anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4  antibodies. The median follow-up for survivors was 5.9 months (range, 2.4-55.6 months). Grade ≥2 AEs included pneumonitis (n = 5; 6%), esophagitis (n = 6; 8%),  and dermatitis (n = 8; 10%). No statistically significant correlation was found between these AEs when comparing concurrent versus sequential treatment. The only significant variable was a correlation of immunotherapy drug category with Grade  ≥2 esophagitis (P = .04). Overall, Grade ≥2 AE rates of thoracic RT and immunotherapy appeared as expected and acceptable. The lack of significant differences in AE rates with  concurrent versus sequential treatment suggests that even concurrent immunotherapy and thoracic RT may be safe."

The decision to treat patients is influenced by PD-L1 expression by tumor cells,  but evidence indicates that this staining is heterogenous within a tumor. As PD-L1 staining is tested mostly on biopsies, false negative results can occur due to sampling issues. The clinical impact of this heterogeneity has not been established. We selected 241 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for adenocarcinoma. Tissue microarrays were constructed with five 1 mm cores representative of the histologic patterns observed in each tumor and stained for  PD-L1. For each core, the histologic pattern and the percentage of PD-L1 positive tumor cells were noted. Staining heterogeneity was defined as cases with both positive and negative cores at positivity thresholds of 1%, 10%, and 50% of tumor cells. At the 50% cut-off, 37.8% of patients were PD-L1 positive, whereas 22.4% showed staining heterogeneity. Among patients with 1 negative core, 26.5% also had a positive core and could have been misclassified based on 1 biopsy. Mean staining of PD-L1 was higher in solid (47.9%) and micropapillary (24.2%) patterns and was lower in acinar (14.1%), papillary (3.4%), and lepidic (6.4%) architectures. A significant proportion of patients presented a heterogenous staining for PD-L1. A total of 26.5% of patients negative on 1 core turned out to be positive on another core, which raises the consideration of rebiopsy, in particular when lepidic, acinar, or papillary patterns are observed on a biopsy."

Our objective was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes previously associated with auto-immunity, which are associated with toxicities in nivolumab-treated NSCLC patients. This was in order to identify patients prone to develop severe toxicities and to gain more insight  into the underlying pathobiology. We analysed 322 nivolumab-treated patients and assessed the association  with toxicities for seven SNPs in four genes, which are considered contributors to PD-1-directed T-cell responses, i.e., PDCD1, PTPN11, ZAP70 and IFNG. Every SNP was tested for its association with toxicity endpoints. Significant associations  were tested in a validation cohort. A multivariable analysis in the exploration cohort showed that homozygous variant patients for PDCD1 804C>T (rs2227981) had decreased odds for any grade treatment-related toxicities (n = 96; OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-1.0; p = 0.039). However, this result could not be validated (n = 85; OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.4-1.9; p = NS). Our results show that it is unlikely that the investigated SNPs have a clinical implication in predicting toxicity. A finding, even though negative, that is considered timely and instructive towards further research in biomarker development for checkpoint inhibitor treatments."

PD-L1 expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), is used to select patients for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. Most studies have been performed with histology specimens, with limited data available on the performance in cytology specimens. This study evaluated PD-L1 in cytology specimens and compared the results with those from paired core-needle biopsy for  concordance. Forty-one NSCLC fine-needle aspiration cases that had paired core-needle biopsy specimens with PD-L1 IHC were selected. A Papanicolaou-stained direct smear and a cell block section from each case were stained with a Dako PD-L1 pharmDx antibody (clone 22C3). Only slides with 100 or more tumor cells (37 smears and 38 cell blocks) were evaluated. Tumor proportion scores (TPS) were assessed on the basis of the partial/complete membranous staining of tumor cells  and were correlated with those of paired core-needle biopsy. All 9 smears that were negative for PD-L1 staining showed 100% concordance with the paired core-needle biopsy, whereas 28 smears with PD-L1 expression showed a similar TPS, except for 1 smear that was discordant. In contrast, 10 negative paired core-needle biopsy cases corresponded to 9 concordant negative cell blocks, whereas 1 cell block had a TPS of 1% to 5%. The  remaining 28 cell blocks demonstrated PD-L1 expression, with 22 cases showing a TPS similar to that of the paired core-needle biopsy, whereas 6 cell blocks were  discordant, likely because of intratumoral heterogeneity. The results show that NSCLC cytology samples evaluated for PD-L1 have high concordance with paired core-needle biopsy samples and can be used for  assessing PD-L1 expression."

Despite the clinical success of targeting inhibitory checkpoint receptors, including PD-1 and/or CTLA-4 on T cells, only a minority of patients derive benefit from these therapies. New strategies to improve cancer immunotherapy are therefore needed. Combination therapy of checkpoint inhibitors  with targeted agents has promisingly shown to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy. Here, we analyzed the immunomodulatory effects of the multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib and its efficacy in combination with immunotherapies. In different syngeneic murine tumor models, axitinib showed therapeutic efficacy that was not only mediated by VEGF-VEGFR inhibition, but also through the induction of anti-cancer immunity. Mechanistically, a significant reduction of immune-suppressive cells, including a decrease of tumor-promoting mast cells and tumor-associated macrophages was observed upon axitinib treatment. Inhibition of mast cells by axitinib as well as their experimental depletion led to reduced tumor growth. Of note, treatment with axitinib led to an improved T cell response, while the latter was pivotal for the therapeutic efficacy. Combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors anti-PD-1 and anti-TIM-3 and/or agonistic engagement of the activating receptor CD137 resulted  in a synergistic therapeutic efficacy. This demonstrates non-redundant immune activation induced by axitinib via modulation of myeloid and mast cells. These findings provide important mechanistic insights into axitinib-mediated anti-cancer immunity and provide rationale for clinical combinations of axitinib  with different immunotherapeutic modalities."

Although it is used for treating advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), its actual efficacy has not been determined. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for related noncomparative clinical studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess nivolumab benefit and risk in NSCLC. The main outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), 1-year overall survival rate (1-yOS rate), and progression-free survival rate at 24 weeks (PFS at 24 weeks rate), any-grade  adverse effects rate (any-grade AEs%), and grade 3-4 AE rate (grade 3-4 AEs%). Relative risk (RR) was used to compare ORR in patients with positive and negative programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Random-effects models were used to determine pooled effect size and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95%  CI). We included 20 studies (17 noncomparative open-label cohort studies, three RCTs) involving 3404 patients in our meta-analysis. The modified nivolumab ORR was 18% (95% CI: 15-20%), the 1-yOS rate was 45% (95% CI: 40-50%), PFS at 24 weeks rate was 42% (95% CI: 37-48%), any-grade AEs% was 61% (95% CI: 50-73%),  and grade 3-4 AEs% was 12% (95% CI: 9-16%). PD-L1 expression was related with the nivolumab ORR. Nivolumab potentially causes ongoing response, long-term PFS, and  reduced treatment-related AEs. PD-L1 expression predicts the outcome of nivolumab immunotherapy. More high-quality and well-designed RCTs with large sample sizes are warranted to prove our findings."

Based on his presentation and CT findings, the  patient was initially treated empirically with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia vs. pneumonitis. During the first 12 hours in observation, the patient  experienced increasing dyspnea and cough and was admitted to the hospital. Nebulizer treatments were administered with no improvement, so the patient was started on high-dose corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg, and pulmonary and infectious disease consults were ordered. After the administration of steroids, the patient's cough and breathing improved and he remained afebrile, eliciting a high suspicion for immune-related pneumonitis. The patient then underwent bronchoscopy to rule out other etiologies. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed, which yielded no pathogenic organisms. The patient was placed on a 3-week course of a high-dose steroid taper, following which immunotherapy was reinstated. Within 4 days he again presented with similar symptoms, was restarted on high-dose steroids, and immunotherapy was permanently discontinued."

To improve survival, different strategies have been developed such as chemotherapy combinations, targeted therapies and more recently immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is based on the capability of the immune system to differentiate cancer cells from normal cells to fight against the tumor. The two main checkpoint inhibitors that have been widely studied in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. However, interactions between tumor and immune system are much more complex with  several different elements that take part and probably many new interactions to be discovered and studied for a better comprehension of those pathways. Vaccines  are part of the prophylaxis and of the treatment for different infectious diseases. For that reason, they have allowed us to improve global survival worldwide. This same idea can be used for cancer treatment. First reports in clinical trials that used therapeutic vaccines in NSCLC were discouraging, but currently vaccines have a new chance in cancer therapy with the identification of new targetable antigens, adjuvant treatments and most interestingly, the combination of vaccines with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 drugs. The aim of this article is to describe the scientific evidence that has been reported for the different types of vaccines and their mechanisms of action in the fight against NSCLC tumors to improve disease control."

The treatment of these oncogene-addicted tumors has dramatically changed the outcome of these patients, where tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and rearranged anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have paved the way for a new era of precision cancer medicine. Another paradigm shift in the treatment of NSCLC, as well as numerous other tumor types, has been the introduction of immunotherapy (IO) with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting mainly programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or its ligand PDL-L1, where studies have demonstrated an increased survival versus standard treatment with chemotherapy, both in the first- and second-line setting. However, the role of IO in oncogene-addicted NSCLC is still unclear where most clinical data come from subgroup analyses with low number of patients in larger randomized trials, and these data do not support the use of IO after TKI in this  category of NSCLC patients. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing evidence about the use of IO in oncogenic-addicted NSCLC and highlight the issues that should be addressed in the future in order to define the role of  IO for these patients."

Although the promising clinical benefit from programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors was observed in the second or subsequent line treatment of patients who progressed on chemotherapy, it has a long way for single PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor to move forward to the frontline without a predictive biomarker. Tumor response is far from satisfactory without selection and primary  or acquired resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors hampered their utility. Therefore, it is crucial to determine a strategy that can optimize the application of immune checkpoint inhibitors and increase the numbers of the responders. Multiple combination approaches based on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are designed and aimed to boost anti-tumor response and benefit a broader population. In this review, we will integrate the updated clinical data to highlight the four most promising combination strategies in advance NSCLC: combination of checkpoint inhibition with chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis, immunotherapy and radiotherapy.  We further discuss the issues needed to be addressed and perspectives in the context of combination era."

Medical and physiological characteristics of elderly cancer patients make the choice of their better treatment more challenging. Furthermore, aging is accompanied by the so called immunosenescence phenomenon, the age-related decline in the immune system that is one of the potential reasons of increase of the incidence and prevalence of most cancers. There is a growing interest in understanding of immunosenescence and how it may correlate with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The survival benefit achieved by immunotherapy in all histologies and therapy line settings, added to its manageable toxicity profile, has dramatically changed the scenario of advanced NSCLC treatment. At subgroup analyses of randomized clinical trials,  elderly NSCLC population seems to benefit from anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1)/anti-programmed death ligand-1 (anti-PD-L1) agents' treatment.

Immunotherapies, including the programmed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab, have resulted in durable responses and long-term overall survival in patients with NSCLC. We hypothesized that combining targeted therapy with immunotherapy could result in more patients with  responses and/or more durable responses. Herein we report data from a study assessing nivolumab plus crizotinib in patients with previously untreated advanced ALK translocation-positive NSCLC. Group E in CheckMate 370 was a single-arm cohort designed to evaluate the safety of first-line nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) plus crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) in patients with ALK translocation-positive NSCLC. The primary endpoint of safety would be met if ≤20% of patients discontinued treatment due to treatment-related adverse events by week 17. Objective response rate was a secondary endpoint. A planned safety review occurred in November 2016; the data cutoff was May 26, 2017. Of the first 13 patients treated with nivolumab plus crizotinib, 5 (38%) developed severe hepatic toxicities leading to the discontinuation of the combination.

On the basis of immunohistochemistry (IHC) results, PD-L1 expression on  tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) was scored as follows: TC0 and IC0 were defined as PD-L1 expression less than 1%, TC1 and IC1 as at least 1% but less than 10%, TC2 and IC2 as 10% or more but less than 50%, and TC3 and IC3 as 50% or more. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) IHC was scored as either lost or retained expression. The Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to identify mutations in all coding exons of 409 cancer-related genes. A total of 192 patients with large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) (n = 72) and SCLC (n = 120) were studied. The prevalence of PD-L1 expression on TCs was 15.1% (29 of 192). IC infiltration and PD-L1 expression on ICs were observed in 34.4% of patients (66 of 192) and 31.3% of patients (60 of 192), respectively. The prevalence of IC infiltration and PD-L1 expression on IC were more strongly correlated with LCNEC than with SCLC (57.6% versus 23.3%, p < 0.01; 45.8% versus 22.5%, p < 0.01) and high nonsynonymous mutations (p = 0.05 and .04). PTEN loss was found in 9.5% of patients (18 of 189) and showed no correlation with PD-L1 expression. Progression-free survival was better in patients with IC infiltration than in those without IC infiltration (median 11.3  versus 6.8 months [p < 0.01]) and in patients with PD-L1 expression of IC1/2/3 than in those with expression of IC0 (median 11.3 versus 7.0 months [p = 0.03]). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is activated in the microenvironment of pulmonary high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma and correlated with a higher mutation burden."

Agonists that target the shared interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15Rβγ pathway have induced complete and durable responses in some cancers, but no studies have been  done to assess the safety or efficacy of these agonists in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We aimed to define the safety, tolerability, and activity of this drug combination in patients with NSCLC. In this non-randomised, open-label, phase 1b trial, we enrolled patients (aged ≥18 years) with previously treated histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV NSCLC from three academic hospitals in the USA. Key eligibility criteria included measurable disease, eligibility to receive anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients received the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab intravenously at 3 mg/kg (then 240 mg when US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved dosing changed) every 14 days (either as new treatment or continued treatment at the time of disease progression) and the IL-15 superagonist ALT-803 subcutaneously once per week on weeks 1-5 of four 6-week cycles for 6 months. ALT-803 was administered at one of four escalating dose concentrations: 6, 10, 15, or 20 μg/kg. The primary endpoint was to define safety and tolerability and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose of ALT-803 in combination with nivolumab. Analyses were per-protocol and included any patients  who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02523469; phase 2 enrolment of patients is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2016, and June 28, 2017, 23 patients were enrolled and  21 were treated at four dose levels of ALT-803 in combination with nivolumab. Two patients did not receive treatment because of the development of inter-current illness during enrolment, one patient due to leucopenia and one patient due to pulmonary dysfunction. No dose-limiting toxicities were recorded and the maximum  tolerated dose was not reached. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions (in 19 [90%] of 21 patients) and flu-like symptoms (15 [71%]). The most common grade 3 adverse events, occurring in two patients each, were lymphocytopenia and fatigue. A grade 3 myocardial infarction occurred in one patient. No grade 4 or 5 adverse events were recorded. The recommended phase 2 dose of ALT-803 is 20 μg/kg given once per week subcutaneously in combination with 240 mg intravenous nivolumab every 2 weeks. INTERPRETATION: ALT-803 in combination with nivolumab can be safely administered  in an outpatient setting. The promising clinical activity observed with the addition of ALT-803 to the regimen of patients with PD-1 monoclonal antibody relapsed and refractory disease shows evidence of anti-tumour activity for a new  class of agents in NSCLC.

Although anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody treatments have been approved, no suitable predictor of significant responders has been identified. Based on the existing information, we investigated the relationship between tumor immunity (including PD-L1) and 18F-FDG uptake in patients with surgically resected pulmonary squamous-cell carcinoma (SQC). This study included 167 patients (153 men and 14 women) with SQC who underwent 18F-FDG PET. Tumor sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for GLUT1, HIF-1α, PD-L1, CD4, CD8, and Foxp3. The relationship between clinicopathological features and 18F-FDG uptake was analyzed. Student's t-test, the χ2 test, non-parametric Spearman's rank test and  the Kaplan-Meier method were used to show associations between variables. The rate of positive PD-L1 expression was 79% (132/167), and PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with GLUT1 (P < 0.01), HIF-1α (P < 10-4), and CD8 (P < 1 × 10-3) expression. The SUVmax of 18F-FDG was significantly correlated with PD-L1 (P = 0.02) and GLUT1 (P < 0.01) expression. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that advanced stage, elevated PD-L1 expression, and elevated SUVmax were independent prognostic factors for predicting poor OS. Among patients with a high SUVmax, multivariate analysis confirmed that advanced stage  and high PD-L1 expression were independent prognostic factors for poor OS; however, there was no significant difference among patients with a low SUVmax. CONCLUSION: High SUVmax on 18F-FDG-PET is associated with PD-L1 expression but is an independent prognostic factor for OS in our population of surgically resected  pulmonary squamous-cell carcinoma."

Here we found a considerable accumulation of Tbet+Foxp3+CD4+ T cells, mediated by the immunosuppressive cytokine TGFβ in the lungs of tumour bearing mice. This is in line with previous studies, demonstrating the important role of TGFβ for the immunopathogenesis of cancer. By gathering results both in murine model and in human disease, we demonstrate that, the conversion of IFNγ producing anti-tumoral T-bet+Th1 CD4+ T cells into immunosuppressive Tbet and Foxp3-PD1 co-expressing regulatory cells could represent an additional important mechanism of TGFβ-mediated blockade of anti-tumour immunity."

Compensatory expression of other immune checkpoints may be correlated with the poor efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies. The inhibitory human leukocyte antigen (HLA)/killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) can effectively block  the killing effect of natural killer (NK) cells on tumors. Our previous studies have confirmed that high expression of KIR was correlated with poor prognosis of  NSCLC. Inhibitory KIR expression was positively correlated with the expression of PD-1. Methods: The expressions of KIR 2D (L1, L3, L4, S4) (BC032422/ADQ31987/NP_002246/NP_036446, Abcam) and PD-1 (NAT 105, Cell marque) proteins was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: The expression of inhibitory KIR in tumor cells or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is associated with PD-1 expression. Among PD-1 positive patients, 76.3% were KIR 2D (L1, L3, L4, S4) positive on tumor cells, and 74.6% were KIR 2D (L1, L3, L4, S4) positive on TILs. We compared the expression of inhibitory KIR before and after treatment with nivolumab in 11 patients with NSCLC. We found that five (45.5%) patients had positive expression of inhibitory  KIR in tumor tissue after being treated with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, two of whom exhibited a significant increase in expression of inhibitory KIR, and three showed no change. PD-1 expression was correlated with KIR 2D (L1, L3, L4, S4) on tumor cells or TILs. The resistance to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody treatment might be related to KIR. The inhibitory HLA/KIR could combine with the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway negatively regulating NSCLC tumor immunity."

The inability of CD8 T cells to reach tumor cells is considered an important mechanism of resistance to cancer immunotherapy. We show  that, in human lung squamous-cell carcinomas, exclusion of CD8 T cells from tumor islets is correlated with a poor clinical outcome and with a low lymphocyte motility, as assessed by dynamic imaging on fresh tumor slices. In the tumor stroma, macrophages mediate lymphocyte trapping by forming long-lasting interactions with CD8 T cells. Using a mouse tumor model with well-defined stromal and tumor cell areas, macrophages were depleted with PLX3397, an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R). Our results reveal that a CSF-1R blockade enhances CD8 T cell migration and infiltration into tumor  islets. Although this treatment alone has minor effects on tumor growth, its combination with anti-PD-1 therapy further increases the accumulation of CD8 T cells in close contact with malignant cells and delays tumor progression. These data suggest that the reduction of macrophage-mediated T cell exclusion increases tumor surveillance by CD8 T cells and renders tumors more responsive to anti-PD-1 treatment."

Acute Nr2f6 silencing in both mouse and human T cells induces hyper-responsiveness that establishes a non-redundant T-cell-inhibitory function  of NR2F6. NR2F6 protein expression in T-cell-infiltrating human NSCLC is upregulated in 54% of the cases (n = 303) and significantly correlates with PD-1  and CTLA-4 expression. Our data define NR2F6 as an intracellular immune checkpoint that suppresses adaptive anti-cancer immune responses and set the stage for clinical validation of targeting NR2F6 for next-generation immuno-oncological regimens."

Studies are necessary to identify detailed characterizations of the response biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences of PD-L1  expression and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density, two major response biomarkers of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, between paired primary and brain metastatic lesions in advanced NSCLC. We observed that among primary lesions or BMs, only a small number of patients harbored common PD-L1 expression on both tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Additionally, we found that the  numbers of CD8+ TILs were significantly fewer in BMs than in primary lung cancers. Low stromal CD8+ TIL numbers in BMs were associated with significantly shorter overall survival compared to high stromal CD8+ TIL counts. Notably, we demonstrated a discrepancy in PD-L1 expression and CD8+ TIL density between primary lung cancers and their corresponding BMs. Such heterogeneities are significantly associated with the time at which BMs occurred. Our study emphasizes the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of biomarkers for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, which should be concerned in clinical practice."

We demonstrated that HHLA2, a newly identified immune inhibitory molecule, was widely expressed in NSCLC. We now compared the expression and function of PD-L1 with alternative immune checkpoints, B7x and HHLA2.Experimental Design: Expression was examined in tissue microarrays consisting of 392 resected NSCLC tumors. Effects of PD-L1, B7x, and HHLA2 on human T-cell proliferation and cytokine production were investigated.Results: PD-L1 expression was identified in 25% and 31% of tumors in the discovery and validation cohorts and was associated with higher stage and lymph node involvement. The multivariate analysis showed that stage, TIL status,  and lymph node involvement were independently associated with PD-L1 expression. B7x was expressed in 69% and 68%, whereas HHLA2 was positive in 61% and 64% of tumors in the two sets. The coexpression of PD-L1 with B7x or HHLA2 was infrequent, 6% and 3%. The majority (78%) of PD-L1-negative cases expressed B7x,  HHLA2, or both. The triple-positive group had more TIL infiltration than the triple-negative group. B7x-Ig and HHLA2-Ig inhibited TCR-mediated proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells more robustly than PD-L1-Ig. All three significantly suppressed cytokine productions by T cells.The majority of PD-L1-negative lung cancers express alternative immune checkpoints. The roles of  the B7x and HHLA2 pathway in mediating immune evasion in PD-L1-negative tumors deserve to be explored to provide the rationale for an effective immunotherapy strategy in these tumors."

In this work, we evaluated several randomised clinical trials to explore the gender influence in the outcome of patients with NSCLC treated with targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Methods: We performed a series of meta-analysis to compare the gender outcome in  the routine setting for overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) in phase III randomised clinical trials comparing EGFR inhibitors versus chemotherapy (OPTIMAL, LUX-lung 3, LUX-lung 6, EURTAC, ENSURE and WTJOG); ALK inhibitors versus chemotherapy (ASCEND 4, ASCEND 5, PROFILE 1014 and NCT009323893) and anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors versus chemotherapy (CheckMate 017, CheckMate 026, CheckMate 057, KEYNOTE 010 and KEYNOTE 024). Results: Female patients with NSCLC have a reduced risk of death compared with men (HR=0.73; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.79; p<0.00001). Women had a better benefit from EGFR inhibitors than men (HR=0.34; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.40; p<0.00001 vs HR=0.44; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.56; p<0.00001, respectively). The benefit from ALK inhibitors was similar for both genders (HR=0.51; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.61; p<0.00001 vs HR=0.48; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.59; p<0.00001, for women and men, respectively). Anti-PD1 inhibitors significantly improved the PFS in male patients when compared with chemotherapy (HR=0.76; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.86; p<0.00001); in contrast, women showed no benefit in 5/5 randomised trials (HR=1.03; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.20; p=0.69). In this exploratory study, some targeted treatments were influenced  by gender. Despite differences in outcomes that could be attributed to different  histology, EGFR and smoking status, gender should be evaluated more deeply as prognostic variable in patients with NSCLC."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, fundamentally those that act by blocking the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligand the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have emerged as novel treatment strategies in NSCLC, demonstrating undoubted superiority over chemotherapy in terms of efficacy. Several of these immune checkpoint modulators have recently gained regulatory approval for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, such as nivolumab, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab in first-line (only the latter) and second-line settings, and more recently, durvalumab as maintenance after chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced disease. There is consensus that PD-L1 expression on tumor cells predicts responsiveness to PD-1 inhibitors in several tumor types. Hence PD-L1 expression evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently used as a clinical decision-making tool to support the use of checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients. However, the value of PD-L1 as the 'definitive' biomarker is controversial as its testing is puzzled by multiple unsolved issues such as the use of different staining platforms and antibodies, the type of cells in which PD-L1 is assessed (tumor versus immune cells), thresholds used for PD-L1-positivity, or the source and timing for sample collection. Therefore, newer biomarkers such as tumor mutation burden and neoantigens as well as biomarkers reflecting host environment (microbiome) or tumor inflamed microenvironment (gene expression signatures) are being explored as more reliable and accurate alternatives to IHC for guiding treatment selection with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC."

Although overall survival (OS) has improved in the first- and second-line therapy settings for advanced NSCLC, the benefit is not universal. In a climate of global scrutiny for healthcare costs and potential for toxicities related to immunotherapy, appropriate patient selection is crucial. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential prognostic  and predictive biomarkers interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor-alpha  (TNF-α) and a panel of interleukins (ILs) in the peripheral blood, and assess any correlation with response to anti-PD-1 inhibition, progression-free survival and  OS in NSCLC patients.

IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 were analyzed by flow cytometry at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months after initiation of anti-PD-1 inhibition. Results: Increased cytokine values (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-8) at the time of diagnosis and at 3 months after initiation of treatment were significantly correlated with improved response to immunotherapy and prolonged OS. There was no correlation between cytokine levels and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. Increased IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12 levels resulted in better response to NSCLC anti-PD-1 inhibition and longer survival, and this could potentially play an important role in selecting patients that would benefit from anti-PD-1 inhibitors."

The epithelioid and sarcomatoid subtypes are characterized by cuboid and fibroblastoid cells, respectively. The biphasic subtype contains a mixture of both. The sarcomatoid subtype expresses markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and confers  the worst prognosis, but the signals and pathways controlling EMT in MPM are not  well understood. We demonstrate that treatment with FGF2 or EGF induced a fibroblastoid morphology in several cell lines from biphasic MPM, accompanied by  scattering, decreased cell adhesion and increased invasiveness. This depended on  the MAP-kinase pathway but was independent of TGFβ or PI3-kinase signaling. In addition to changes in known EMT markers, microarray analysis demonstrated differential expression of MMP1, ESM1, ETV4, PDL1 and BDKR2B in response to both  growth factors and in epithelioid versus sarcomatoid MPM. Inhibition of MMP1 prevented FGF2-induced scattering and invasiveness. Moreover, in MPM cells with sarcomatoid morphology, inhibition of FGF/MAP-kinase signaling induced a more epithelioid morphology and gene expression pattern. Our findings suggest a critical role of the MAP-kinase axis in the morphological and behavioral plasticity of mesothelioma."

Tumor cells expression (TC) of PD-L1 is an important predictor of the of response to immune check-point inhibition in NSCLC, while the composition of the immune cells (IC) in the tumor microenvironment including PD-L1+ cells is believed to predict responses in tumors of some other primary sites. Total mutational load (TML) and microsatellite instability (MSI) also play a role in response to the immune checkpoint blockade. We investigated immune microenvironment characteristics (PD-1, PD-L1, CD8) of 257 lung biopsies including 81 primary (NSCLC) and 176 metastatic tumors to the lungs. TML and MSI  were calculated from massively parallel sequencing (592-gene panel). TC expression of PD-L1 was more common in NSCLC than in metastatic carcinomas (28% vs. 10%, p=0.009), while PD-L1-positive IC were present at relevant percentages (1-5%) exclusively in metastatic carcinomas (31% IC positive vs. 0%, p<0.001). Metastatic carcinomas carried significantly lower TML in comparison with the NSCLCs (6.6 mutations on average vs. 10, p=0.01). All primary NSCLC were microsatellite stable, and only 2 metastatic carcinomas exhibited MSI-H status. The number of PD-1+ and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes did not differ significantly between the primary and metastatic carcinomas. Our study revealed significant differences in tumor immune microenvironment (PD-L1 in IC and TC), and its relationship to TML between NSCLC and metastatic cancers. These differences could determine the choice of a predictive biomarker test and subsequently effect(s) of the immune therapy treatments in various advanced cancers."

The prescription of pembrolizumab for advanced stage non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients requires the demonstration of PD-L1 expression by tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (minimum of 50% of positive tumor cells is required for first-line setting, and of 1% for second-line and beyond) and PD-L1 assay is  now considered as a companion diagnostic tool for this drug. Numerous standardized PD-L1 assays performed on dedicated platforms have been validated in clinical trials, each antibody being associated to one specific PD1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. However, not all pathologists have access to the dedicated platforms and the high cost of these assays is still a limitation to their implementation;  in addition, the small size of the NSCLC tumor samples does not allow to perform  at the same time multiple assays for multiple drugs.

VISTA expression was higher in T-lymphocytes  than in macrophages; and in cytotoxic T cells than in T-helper cells. Elevated VISTA was associated with absence of EGFR mutations and lower mutational burden in lung adenocarcinomas.

Conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems can detect sPD-L1 using anti-PD-L1 capture antibody through the antigen-antibody reaction, but cannot evaluate the quality and function of sPD-L1. In this study,  we developed a novel ELISA system for the detection and quantification of sPD-L1  with PD-1-binding capacity (bsPD-L1). To capture bsPD-L1 through the ligand-receptor reaction, the anti-PD-L1 capture antibody in the conventional ELISA was replaced with PD-1-Ig fusion protein in the new ELISA. The new ELISA could detect bsPD-L1 in 29 out of 75 plasma samples from patients with non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with higher sensitivity and frequency than the conventional ELISA. The western blot analysis showed that sPD-L1 in the plasma was glycosylated. Treatment of the samples with glycosidase reduced the absorbance determined by the new ELISA but had no effect on the absorbance determined by the conventional ELISA. These results suggest that glycosylation of sPD-L1 is important for its binding to the immobilized PD-1 in the new ELISA.

For the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade assay, the TILs and peripheral blood mononuclear CD8 T cells were cultured (1×105 per well) with anti-PD-1 (clone MIH4), anti-PD-L1 (clone MIH1). The cytotoxic activity of TILs in killing NSCLC cells after stimulation by anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 was measured by a conventional 51Cr release assay. We first identified a population of high-PD-L1-expressing CD25-positive  CD4-positive T cells (PD-L1hi Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment. The frequency of PD-L1hi Tregs was higher in tumor tissue (mean 48.6 ± 14.3% in CD25-positive CD3-positive CD4-positive T cells) than in blood (mean 35.4 ± 10.2% in CD25-positive CD3-positive CD4-positive T cells) and normal tissue (mean 38.6 ± 9.7% in CD25-positive CD3-positive CD4-positive T cells) (p < 0.05), as determined by flow cytometry. The frequency of PD-L1hi Tregs was positively correlated with PD-1-positive CD8 in Tregs. In addition, the TILs from these patients (PD-1hi PD-L1hi) showed PD-1/PD-L1 pathway dependence and could induce a greater killing effect of TILs by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade treatment. The patients with PD-L1-positive NSCLC with PD-1hi PD-L1hi TILs showed a better clinical outcome than those with a low frequency of PD-1hi CD8 or PD-L1hi Tregs (median progression-free survival not reached versus 2 months). Our findings suggested that the density of PD-L1-positive CD4-positive CD25-positive Tregs in the tumor microenvironment can serve as a diagnostic factor to supplement PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and predict the response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy in NSCLC."

Recent approvals of several anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) drugs for lung cancer treatment prompted ongoing clinical trials that directly combine PD-1 inhibitors with thoracic radiotherapy for locally advanced lung cancer. Overlapping toxicities from either modality have the potential to increase the risk for radiation-induced cardiotoxicity (RICT), which is well documented among patients with Hodgkin's disease and breast cancer. To investigate cardiotoxicity without the compounding pulmonary toxicity from thoracic radiotherapy, we developed a technique to deliver cardiac irradiation (CIR) in a mouse model concurrently with PD-1 blockade to determine the presence of cardiac toxicity by using physiological testing and mortality as  end points along with histological analysis. We observed an acute mortality of 30% within 2 weeks after CIR plus anti-PD-1 antibody compared with 0% from CIR plus immunoglobulin G (p = 0.023). Physiological testing demonstrated a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.01) by echocardiogram. Tissue analyses revealed increased immune cell infiltrates within cardiac tissue. Depletion of CD8-positive lymphocytes with anti-CD8 antibody reversed the acute mortality, suggesting that the toxicity is CD8-positive cell-mediated. To validate these findings using a clinically relevant fractionated radiotherapy regimen, we repeated the study by delivering five daily fractions of 6 Gy. Similar mortality, cardiac dysfunction, and histological changes were observed in mice receiving fractionated radiotherapy with concurrent anti-PD-1 therapy. This study provides strong preclinical evidence that radiation-induced cardiotoxicity is modulated by the PD-1 axis and that PD-1 blockade should be administered with careful radiotherapy planning with an effort of reducing cardiac dose."

In  most patients, chemotherapy is recommended alone or in addition to resection. Novel immunotherapies blocking the PD-L1 pathway have been introduced into therapeutic regimens for NSCLC with great success. In order to evaluate a possible efficacy of an anti-PD-L1 therapy, we analyzed the frequency of PD-L1 expression in LCNEC. MATERIAL AND We retrospectively reviewed data from 76 patients with LCNEC treated in our institution between 1998 and 2010. The expression of PD-L1 was examined on the tumor cells and the tumor surrounding tissue by immunohistochemistry. An expression of >1% was considered as positive. Statistical analysis was performed to determine significant predictors for survival. 56 of 76 patients with LCNEC were treated with a potentially therapeutic surgical approach. Tumor-specific survival (TSS) of the entire cohort was 29% at  five years. 17 patients (22.3%) had PD-L1 positive tumors and 12 of these had no  additional PD-L1 expression in the adjacent immune cell infiltrate. Tumor-flanking immune cells were found PD-L1 positive 28 patients; 16 of these had no additional expression on the tumor cells. The most considerable difference in survival was found when comparing patients with isolated PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and PD-L1 negative immune cell infiltrate to their counterpart (positive immune-cell infiltrate and PD-L1 negative tumor cell surface; 5-year TSS: 0% vs. 60%; p < 0.017). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression in LCNEC was associated with poorer survival whereas PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment seemed to have a beneficial effect. Therapeutic approaches have to be evaluated in future."

However, the assessment of PD-L1 expression on small  tissue specimens needs to be evaluated and the association with other features more thoroughly analyzed. This retrospective single center study evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of the SP263 anti-PD-L1 antibody on tissue microarrays (TMA) of 152 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas, using a 25% positivity threshold. The positive cases and 50 randomly chosen negative cases in tissue microarray (TMA) were reassessed on whole tissue sections. The results were correlated to clinical, histopathological and to molecular data obtained through the screening  of 214 mutations in 26 genes (LungCarta panel, Agena Biosciences). Among 152 primary lung adenocarcinomas, 19 cases (13%) showed PD-L1 expression. The agreement between TMA and whole tissue sections was 89%, specificity was 97%. PD-L1 expression was correlated to RAS mutations (p = .04),  RAS/TP53 co-mutations (p = .01) and to the solid or acinar subtype (p = .048). With the SP263 PD-L1 antibody, small samples appear as a reliable means to evaluate the PD-L1 status in lung adenocarcinoma. The association between PD-L1 expression and RAS/TP53 mutations may have clinical relevance to predict the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoints inhibitors."

However, the frequency of POLE gene mutation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been reported. We assessed POLE mutation in 319 patients with NSCLC by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 416 cancer-associated genes. Expression of PD-L1, DNA mismatch repair proteins (MMR), and the abundance of CD8-positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were assayed by immunohistochemistry. Progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared among groups using log-rank tests. Nine of the 319 patients (2.8%) harbored POLE mutation. All nine had adenocarcinomas. The median tumor mutational burdens (TMBs) were 12.2/Mb and 7.8/Mb in patients with and without POLE mutation, respectively (P = 0.026). PD-L1, MMR (including MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2), and CD8-positive TILs were evaluated in all nine patients. No microsatellite instability was detected, but seven patients had high levels of CD8-positive TILs and five demonstrated PD-L1 staining >25%. One patient receiving the PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab demonstrated a partial response, with a PFS of >8 months. CONCLUSION: POLE mutation represents an uncommon phenotype in NSCLC. TMB, PD-L1 expression, and CD8-positive TILs were all higher in patients with mutant compared with wild-type POLE. POLE mutation may thus represent a candidate biomarker for response to immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC."

The frequency of high PD-L1 expression in NSCLCs with known driver oncogenes has remained unclear, however. We retrospectively evaluated PD-L1 expression with the 22C3 assay in tumor tissue of 80 lung adenocarcinoma patients including 71 with EGFR mutations and 9 with ALK rearrangements, all of whom were treated with corresponding tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Of the 80 tumors analyzed, 26 (32.5%) had a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of 1%-49% and 9 (11.3%) had a PD-L1 TPS of ≥50%; 35 (43.8%) thus had a PD-L1 TPS of ≥1%.

Limited evidence exists on the safety and efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections as these patients have traditionally been excluded from clinical trials because of a theoretical risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. We aim to determine the safety and efficacy of treatment with PD-1 inhibitors in seven patients with HBV/HCV infection and concurrent metastatic melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We describe seven patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab for either metastatic melanoma or metastatic NSCLC in the setting of chronic or past  HBV/HCV infection. The safety and efficacy of treatment were analysed retrospectively by examining response to treatment, alanine transaminase (ALT) trends and viral load trends. One patient showed an increase in ALT of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 severity that returned to the normal range following treatment of his HCV infection with ledipasvir 90 mg/sofosbuvir 400 mg. An additional four patients showed an increase in ALT of CTCAE grade 1 severity. The remaining two patients experienced no hepatic toxicity, with stable disease continuing after more than 24 cycles of nivolumab.  Efficacy was similar to the data of published trials. Our results indicate that patients with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC can be treated safely with PD-1 inhibitors in the context of HBV/HCV infection. However, we recommend that those  with active viral hepatitis be monitored closely in consultation with a hepatologist and treated with antiviral therapy if indicated."

Interferon regulatory factors (IRF) are frequently epigenetic silenced in carcinogenesis, while the role of methylation in anti-PD-1/L1 therapy remains unclear. We here investigated the methylation status of IFN-γ related genes IRF1/8 and IFN-α/β-related genes IRF3/7 in lung cancer tissues and found that only highly methylated IRF1 and 7 negatively correlated to cd274 (coding PD-L1) expression, similar to JAK mutation. Interestingly, decitibine (DAC) as methylation inhibitor could hypomethylate IRF1/7 to restore PD-L1 level. Meanwhile, IRF7 enhanced constitutive PD-L1 expression, which was independent of IFN-γ though directly promote transcription of PD-L1, leading to abrogating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generation which could be restored by anti-PD-L1 antibody, or siRNA-IRF7.  The supplement of DAC to anti-PD-1 therapy in vivo improve the efficiency of anti-tumor with less methylated IRF1/7, more interferon-related genes expression  (e.g., CXCL9) and IFN-γ/CD8+ T-cells infiltrations, suggesting that additional treatment of DAC could rescue the ability to response to IFN in lung cancer patients with anti-PD-1/L1 therapy resistance."

Besides the well-known check-point control programmed death 1 and its ligand, many more mechanisms, acting either tumoricidal or in favor of tumor progression, exist. Analysis of the immune cell profiles in resected tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage samples and correlation between them and with overall survival data was performed. In all tumor samples in this study, cells of the immune system expressed a tumor-cooperating phenotype. High numbers of regulatory T cells, or alternatively expression of Vista on lymphocytes was present. Tumoricidal dendritic cells were  absent in tumor tissue, and barely present in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas tumor-friendly monocytoid and plasmocytoid dendritic cells were seen in both. Alveolar macrophages were predominantly differentiated into tumor-cooperating M2  types, whereas tumoricidal M1 macrophages were absent or rare. The expression of  PDL1 on tumor cells did not correlate with any other immune cells. Expression of  PD1 on lymphocytes was frequently encountered. None of analyzed immune cells showed correlation with overall survival. Immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage  and tissue did not correlate. For the first time, a tissue-based analysis of different immune cells in squamous cell and adenocarcinomas of the lung is provided, trying to explain their potential role in tumor development and progression. Discordant numbers of cells with bronchoalveolar lavage are most probably due to the fact that bronchoalveolar lavage reflects the situation in the whole lung, where chronic obstructive lung disease and other conditions are present."

CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 69-year old patient with a relapsed squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx with lung metastasis after receiving adjuvant concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy. This patient was treated with pembrolizumab and benefitted from therapy with major radiological improvement of  disease. After 14 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg IV each 3 weeks, he experienced  dysphagia that evolved to a grade 4 oral cavity and pharynx mucositis and esophagitis. Histologic analysis showed ulcerative esophagitis associated with granulation tissue. Pembrolizumab was discontinued and IV methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day was initiated. Two days later, the patient reported a 50% recovery in his symptoms which were completely resolved after 2 weeks. Methylprednisolone was switched to oral prednisone and a taper was planned over 8 weeks. During the fourth week of taper, the patient presented recurrence of grade 1 oral mucositis. Prednisone was increased 2 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by slower tapering over a period of 5 months. Pembrolizumab was not reinitiated. CONCLUSION: This is the first described case of grade 4 immune mucositis and esophagitis associated with pembrolizumab. Because the use of pembrolizumab is increasing in oncology, pharmacists and physicians should be aware of this rare manifestation."

PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in patients with stage IV NSCLC. In addition, preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests that chemotherapy and radiation may work synergistically with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor immunity, which has led to the initiation of clinical trials testing these drugs in patients with stage III NSCLC. A preliminary report of a randomized phase III trial, the PACIFIC trial, demonstrated an impressive increase in median progression-free survival with consolidative durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, compared with observation after cCRT.

Because natural killer (NK) cells express IL-18 receptors, IL-18 may play roles in immune functions of NK cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of IL-18 on NK cells derived from lung cancer patients and healthy adult volunteers. When peripheral blood NK cells were stimulated with IL-2, the cells formed clusters beginning on day 5-6 and proliferated thereafter, in which the number of NK cells increased by 10-fold in 10 days. When IL-18 was added, cell clusters were observed as early as on day 4 and NK cells proliferated vigorously. On day 10, the expansion rate was 56-fold on average, showing that IL-18 promoted the expansion of NK cells. It was also notable that IL-18 enhanced the expression of CD80, CD86, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ on NK cells, suggesting that IL-18 conferred NK cells an APC-like phenotype. When cellular cytotoxicity was determined, APC-like NK cells efficiently killed tumor cells and anti-tumor activity was augmented by the addition of tumor antigen-specific mAbs. In addition, IFN-γ was produced by APC-like NK cells in response to tumor cells, and the cytokine production was further enhanced by mAbs. Taken together, IL-18 not only promoted the expansion of NK cells, but also changed the phenotype of NK cells. IL-2/IL-18-induced NK cells might, therefore, serve as a bridge between innate immunity and adaptive immunity and be useful for cancer immunotherapy."

Immunohistochemistry staining of melanoma tissues showed an enhanced expression of IL-34 in metastatic refractory melanoma compared to primary melanoma tissues, which correlates with increased frequencies of CD163+ macrophages. We introduce for the first time a clinical case of a patient with metastatic refractory melanoma that acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, showing an enhanced expression of IL-34 in refractory melanoma tissues."

RECENT FINDINGS: Agents targeting immune checkpoint receptors (IR) such as program death 1 (PD1) have been used in the clinical realm for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the use of these agents for these malignancies has provided crucial information about how and why patients respond  or not to inhibitory checkpoint receptor blockade therapy (ICR). The anti PD1 agent, nivolumab, was recently approved by the FDA as a standard of care regimen  for patients with platinum refractory recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC. Molecular pathways leading to resistance are starting to be identified, and work is underway to understand the most optimal treatment regimen with incorporation of immunotherapy. ICR has renewed interest in the immunology of cancer, but resistance is not uncommon, and thus understanding of these mechanisms will allow the clinician to appropriately select patients that will benefit from this therapy."

This has primarily been fueled by the much perceived necessity to procure an alternative to current standard of care chemotherapy agents, owing to several concerns such as treatment-related toxicity and poor long-term survival associated with the same. The knowledge of various mechanisms involved in regulation of immune response to cancer cells has served a fundamental role in identifying key molecules through which immune cell activity may be modulated. This in-turn led to the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Presently, lung cancer is among the most enthusiastically investigated targets for treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Encouraging results with initial trials have now translated to attempts directed at further enhancement of outcomes through various strategies. Herein, we shall present a critical assessment of data from pivotal trials that led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of various immune-checkpoint inhibitors and also discuss novel strategies that may potentially yield outcomes superior to standard of care chemotherapy in patients  diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)."

Monoclonal antibodies directed against the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) provides durable disease control, particularly in melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder and head and neck cancers. The purpose of this review is to synthesize current data on the expression of PD-L1 in breast cancer and on the preliminary clinical results of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer patients. In breast cancer, PD-L1 expression is heterogeneous and is generally associated with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as the presence of poor-prognosis factors, such as young age, high grade, ER-negativity, PR-negativity, and HER-2 overexpression, high proliferative index, and aggressive molecular subtypes (triple negative, basal-like, HER-2-overexpressing). Its prognostic value remains controversial when assessed with immunohistochemistry, whereas it seems favorable in triple-negative cancers when assessed at the mRNA level. Early clinical trials with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in breast cancer have shown efficacy in terms of tumor response and/or disease control in refractory metastatic breast cancers, notably  in the triple-negative subtype. Many trials are currently underway, both in the metastatic and neo-adjuvant setting. A crucial issue is identification of biomarkers predictive of response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors."

Fifteen HIV-infected patients with NSCLC were compared with 29 non-HIV-infected patients with NSCLC. Analysis of 13 propensity-score-matched patients in the two groups was also compared. The expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and tumor infiltration by CD4+, CD8+, and CD56+ immune cells were examined by immunohistochemistry; score of ≥ 2 was defined as positive. Although high PD-L1 expression in tumor cells was observed in HIV and non-HIV cohorts, the association of PD-1/PD-L1 was significant only in the HIV cohort. In overall as well as the propensity-matched analyses, HIV-infected patients with high PD-L1 expression showed shorter survival than HIV-infected patients with low PD-L1 expression; no significant difference was observed in this respect in the non-HIV cohort. CONCLUSION: High PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue was associated with poor prognosis in HIV-infected NSCLC patients but not in non-HIV-infected NSCLC patients. These results suggest that antitumor immunity by PD-1/PD-L1 axis might  be suppressed more in HIV-infected NSCLC patients as compared to their non-HIV-infected counterparts."

We used phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression through IHC  as a surrogate tissue quality marker to screen surgical NSCLC samples in tissue microarray (TMA; 172 cases) or whole-section (268 cases) format. The samples were then analyzed with a clinically validated PD-L1 IHC assay. The results were correlated with baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes. PTEN IHC showed that 108 TMA samples and 105 whole-section samples qualified for PD-L1 IHC. With  a clinically relevant cutoff, 41.7% of the TMA samples were PD-L1 positive. PD-L1 level was much lower in EGFR-mutant patients and seemed to be a favorable prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). These findings were confirmed in the whole-section samples except that their survival data were not mature enough for correlation analysis. In summary,  PD-L1 expression was detected in approximately 40% of PTEN-qualified Chinese NSCLC samples, negatively correlated with EGFR mutation and seemed to be a favorable prognostic factor for both OS and RFS. Notably, the different results from PTEN-qualified and PTEN-disqualified samples underscore the importance of tissue quality control prior to biomarker testing."

Data from 54 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies were retrospectively analyzed. The NLR  was assessed at baseline and 6 weeks after the start of treatment (post-treatment). Eighteen of 54 patients (33.3%) had objective responses to treatment. Older age, absence of brain metastasis, low post-treatment NLR (< 5),  and immune-related adverse events were significantly associated with response. Patients with a high post-treatment NLR (≥ 5) had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) than those with a low post-treatment NLR (median, 1.3 vs. 6.1 months, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high post-treatment NLR [hazard ratio (HR) 15.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-50.1, p < 0.001], liver metastasis (HR 4.9, 95% CI 1.9-12.4, p = 0.001), and  brain metastasis (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3-8.2, p = 0.013) were independent prognostic  factors of shorter PFS. Overall survival (OS) was significantly different in patients with high and low post-treatment NLRs (median, 2.1 vs. 14.0 months, p < 0.001). A high post-treatment NLR remained an independent prognostic factor for OS in multivariate analysis (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.6-9.2, p = 0.003).

Additionally, the contribution of CD103+CD8+ TILs to effective PD-1 based immunotherapy has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identified that the expression levels of E-cadherin and TGF-β were significantly correlated with the distribution and the density of  CD103+ TILs in lung cancer tumor tissues. Unexpectedly, we observed that CD103+CD8+ TILs that expressed higher levels of PD-1 co-express Ki-67. Moreover,  CD103+CD8+ TILs expressed an increased level of T-bet compared to their counterparts, indicating these cells may be better armed for immunotherapy. Lastly, PD-1 pathway blockade led to a significantly increased production of IFN-γ by CD103+CD8+ TILs, suggesting CD103+CD8+ TILs could serve as a predictive  biomarker for PD-1 based immunotherapy."

Randomized controlled trials that compared PD-1/PD-L1-inhibitor monotherapy with chemotherapy or placebo in patients with previously treated NSCLC were included. Five trials were included (n = 3025). For all studies, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; P < .001) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus chemotherapy (HR, 0.86; P = .020).

Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy have been the standard treatment for lung cancer,  and targeted molecular therapy has greatly improved the clinical course of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring driver mutations, such as in epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase genes. Despite advances in such therapies, the prognosis of patients with NSCLC without  driver oncogene mutations remains poor. Immunotherapy targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has recently been shown to improve the survival in advanced NSCLC. The PD-L1 expression on the surface of tumor cells has emerged as a potential biomarker for predicting responses to immunotherapy and prognosis after surgery in NSCLC. However, the utility of PD-L1 expression as a predictive and prognostic biomarker remains controversial because of the existence of various PD-L1 antibodies, scoring systems, and positivity cutoffs. In this review, we summarize the data from representative clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC and previous reports on the association between PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC.

RECENT FINDINGS: Lung cancer has become a paradigm for the success of molecular targeted therapies in solid tumors. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective treatment options in adenocarcinoma patients with an EGFR, ALK, ROS1 or B-Raf Proto-Oncogene, Serine/Threonine kinase mutation. Additional molecular targets that are addressed in clinical trials include ERBB2, MET, RET, NTRK1 and FGFR. Therapies with antibodies that block the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and thereby liberate an antitumor immune response have introduced a new era in cancer therapy with impressive therapeutic benefits. The high financial burden, treatment failures and therapeutic side effects of immunotherapies have prompted  a search for biomarkers beyond PD-L1 expression, for example, tumor mutation load or immune cell profiling, that might more reliably identify patients that are likely to respond. The discoveries of cancer research have been translated into the clinical management of lung cancer patients. So far, the approach of targeted therapy that is directed towards certain molecular alterations in a given tumor has been successful for adenocarcinomas, but not yet for squamous or small cell carcinomas. Further clinical progress will require a better understanding of the  molecular interactions within cancer cells that will subsequently enable innovative drug designs. Diagnostic molecular pathology will be a provider of information on a tumor's features and thus, navigate precision cancer therapy."

We decided to analyse the safety and effectiveness of anti-PD-1 antibodies in AID patients and look for an association between the presence of pre-existing AID and the clinical outcome. In a prospective study of the REISAMIC registry of grade ≥2 irAEs occurring in ICI-treated patients, we studied the associations between pre-existing AID on one hand and irAE-free survival, overall survival and best objective response rate on the other. We identified 45 patients with 53 AIDs in REISAMIC. The cancer diagnoses included melanoma (n = 36), non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 6) and others (n = 3). The most frequent pre-existing AIDs were vitiligo (n = 17), psoriasis (n = 12), thyroiditis (n = 7), Sjögren syndrome (n = 4) and rheumatoid arthritis  (n = 2). Twenty patients (44.4%) presented with at least one irAE: eleven of these were associated with a pre-existing AID ('AID flare'). Treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies was maintained in 15 of the 20 patients with an irAE. The IrAE-free survival time was significantly shorter in AID patients (median: 5.4 months) than in AID-free patients (median: 13 months, p = 2.1 × 10-4). The AID and AID-free groups did not differ significantly with regard to the overall survival time and objective response rate (p = 0.38 and 0.098, respectively). CONCLUSION: In patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibody, pre-existing AID was associated with a significantly increased risk of irAEs. Our results indicate that cancer treatments with anti-PD-1 antibodies are just as effective in AID patients as they are in AID-free patients."

Clinically available tools to optimize use of ICIs and understand the molecular determinants of response are needed. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly routine, but its role in identifying predictors of response to ICIs is not known. Methods Detailed clinical annotation and response data were collected for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer treated with anti-programmed death-1 or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1] therapy and profiled by targeted NGS (MSK-IMPACT; n = 240). Efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, and durable clinical benefit (DCB) was defined as partial response/stable disease that lasted > 6 months. Tumor mutation burden (TMB), fraction of copy number-altered genome, and  gene alterations were compared among patients with DCB and no durable benefit (NDB). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 49 patients to compare quantification of TMB by targeted NGS versus WES. Results Estimates of TMB by targeted NGS correlated well with WES (ρ = 0.86; P < .001). TMB was greater in patients with DCB than with NDB ( P = .006). DCB was more common, and progression-free survival was longer in patients at increasing thresholds above versus below the 50th percentile of TMB (38.6% v 25.1%; P < .001; hazard ratio, 1.38; P = .024). The fraction of copy number-altered genome was highest in those  with NDB. Variants in EGFR and STK11 associated with a lack of benefit. TMB and PD-L1 expression were independent variables, and a composite of TMB plus PD-L1 further enriched for benefit to ICIs. Conclusion Targeted NGS accurately estimates TMB and elevated TMB further improved likelihood of benefit to ICIs. TMB did not correlate with PD-L1 expression; both variables had similar predictive capacity. The incorporation of both TMB and PD-L1 expression into multivariable predictive models should result in greater predictive power."

Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter retrospective study with a test (n = 161) and a validation set (n = 305) treated with programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors in 8 European centers, and a  control cohort (n = 162) treated with chemotherapy only. Complete blood cell counts, LDH, and albumin levels were measured before ICI treatment. A lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) based on dNLR greater than 3 and LDH greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) was developed, characterizing 3 groups (good, 0 factors; intermediate, 1 factor; poor, 2 factors). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and disease control rate (DCR). Results: In the pooled ICI cohort (N = 466), 301 patients (65%) were male, 422 (90%) were current or former smokers, and 401 (87%) had performance status of 1 or less; median age at diagnosis was 62 (range, 29-86) years; 270 (58%) had adenocarcinoma and 159 (34%) had squamous histologic subtype. Among 129 patients  with PD-L1 data, 96 (74%) had PD-L1 of at least 1% by immunohistochemical analysis, and 33 (26%) had negative results. In the test cohort, median PFS and OS were 3 (95% CI, 2-4) and 10 (95% CI, 8-13) months, respectively. A dNLR greater than 3 and LDH greater than ULN were independently associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.22; 95% CI, 1.23-4.01 and HR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.32-4.76, respectively). Median OS for poor, intermediate, and good LIPI was 3 months (95%  CI, 1 month to not reached [NR]), 10 months (95% CI, 8 months to NR), and 34 months (95% CI, 17 months to NR), respectively, and median PFS was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.7-4.0), 3.7 (95% CI, 3.0-4.8), and 6.3 (95% CI, 5.0-8.0) months (both P < .001). Disease control rate was also correlated with dNLR greater than 3 and  LDH greater than ULN. Results were reproducible in the ICI validation cohort for  OS, PFS, and DCR, but were nonsignificant in the chemotherapy cohort. Pretreatment LIPI, combining dNLR greater than 3 and LDH greater than ULN, was correlated with worse outcomes for ICI, but not for chemotherapy, suggesting that LIPI can serve as a potentially useful tool when selecting ICI treatment, raising the hypothesis that the LIPI might be useful for identifying patients unlikely to benefit from treatment with an ICI."

Design, Setting, and Participants: In this study based on landmark and multivariable analyses, a total of 134 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC  who were treated with nivolumab in the second-line setting or later between December 2015 and August 2016 were identified from a review of medical records from multiple institutions, including a university hospital and community hospitals. Data were updated as of December 31, 2016. Exposures: The absence or presence of any irAE before the landmark date. Kaplan-Meier curves of progression-free survival (PFS) according to the development of irAEs in 6-week landmark analysis were evaluated with the log-rank test as a preplanned primary objective. Overall survival (OS) was similarly evaluated. Multivariable analysis of both PFS and OS  was performed with Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results: In a cohort of 134 patients (median [range] age, 68 [33-85] years; 90 men [67%], 44 women [33%]), irAEs were observed in 69 of the 134 study patients (51%), including 12 patients (9%) with such events of grade 3 or 4, and 24 patients (18%) requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. In 6-week landmark analysis, median PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI, 4.4 to not reached [NR]) and 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.0 to 7.5) (P = .04) whereas median OS was NR (95% CI, 12.3 to NR) and 11.1 months (95% CI, 9.6 to NR) (P = .01) for patients with or without irAEs, respectively. Multivariable analysis also revealed that irAEs were positively associated with survival outcome, with hazard ratios of 0.525 (95% CI, 0.287 to 0.937; P = .03) for PFS and 0.282 (95% CI, 0.101 to 0.667; P = .003) for OS. Development of irAEs was associated with survival outcome of nivolumab treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings."

Further, real-world usage patterns of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors following approval can inform future studies of subpopulations underrepresented in clinical trials. We performed a multicenter analysis using electronic health record data collected during routine care of patients treated in community cancer care clinics in the Flatiron Health network. Real-world metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received nivolumab or pembrolizumab in the metastatic setting (n = 1,344) were selected from a starting random sample of 55,969 NSCLC patients with two or more documented visits from January 1, 2011, through March 31, 2016. The primary study outcome measurement was demographic and treatment characteristics of the cohort. Median age at PD-1 inhibitor initiation was 69 years (interquartile range 61-75). Patients were 56% male, 88% smokers, 65% nonsquamous histology, and 64% diagnosed at stage IV. Of 1,344 patients, 112 (8%) were tested for programmed death-ligand 1 expression. Overall, 50% received nivolumab or pembrolizumab in the second line, with a substantial proportion of third and later line use that began to decline in Q4 2015. CONCLUSION: During the year following U.S. regulatory approval of PD-1 inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC, real-world patients receiving nivolumab or pembrolizumab  were older at treatment initiation and more had smoking history relative to clinical trial cohorts. Studies of outcomes in underrepresented subgroups are needed to inform real-world treatment decisions. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Evidence gathered in conventional clinical trials used to assess safety and efficacy of new therapies is not necessarily generalizable to real-world patients receiving these drugs following regulatory approval. Real-world evidence derived from electronic health record data can yield complementary evidence to enable optimal clinical decisions. Examined here is a cohort of programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor-treated metastatic non-small  cell lung cancer patients in the first year following regulatory approval of these therapies in this indication. The analysis revealed how the real-world cohort differed from the clinical trial cohorts, which will inform which patients are underrepresented and warrant additional studies."

Although PD-L1 expression serves as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of immunotherapy, there are no established biomarkers to predict the expression of PD-L1. The inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were recently shown to predict the efficacy of  nivolumab for NSCLC patients. Therefore, here we investigated the potential association of PD-L1 expression with systemic inflammatory markers, including CRP, NLR, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio. We retrospectively examined tumor PD-L1 expression in 508 surgically resected primary NSCLC cases by immunohistochemical analysis (cut-off value: 1%). The association of PD-L1 expression with preoperative systemic inflammatory markers was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. We generated a PD-L1 association score (A-score) from serum CRP level (cut-off value: 0.3 mg/dl) and smoking status to predict PD-L1 expression. Among the total 508 patients, 188 (37.0%) patients were positive for PD-L1 expression at the 1% cut-off value and 90 (17.5%) had elevated serum CRP level. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that PD-L1 positivity was significantly associated with advanced stage, the presence of vascular invasion and high serum CRP level (P = .0336, .0106 and 0.0018, respectively). Though not  significant, smoking history tended to be associated with PD-L1 protein expression (P = .0717). There was no correlation with other inflammatory markers. Smoking history with elevated CRP level (A-score: 2) was strongly associated with PD-L1 protein expression (odds ratio: 5.18, P < .0001), while it was inversely associated with EGFR mutation (odds ratio: 0.11, P < .0001). Our results indicate that among all systemic inflammatory markers examined, serum CRP seems to predict PD-L1 expression in patients with NSCLC however the clinical applicability is limited given the obtained area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values."

PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) is a  hallmark of adaptive resistance and its expression is often used to predict the outcome of Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 immunotherapy treatments. However, clinical benefits do not occur in all patients and new approaches are needed to assist in selecting patients for PD-1 or PD-L1 immunotherapies. Here, we hypothesized that patient tumor cell genomics influenced cell signaling and expression of PD-L1, chemokines, and immunosuppressive molecules and these profiles could be used to predict patient clinical responses. We used a recent dataset from NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. Deleterious gene mutational profiles in patient exomes were identified and annotated into a cancer network to create NSCLC patient-specific predictive computational simulation models. Validation checks were performed on the cancer network, simulation model predictions, and PD-1 match rates between patient-specific predicted and clinical responses. Expression profiles of these 24 chemokines and immunosuppressive molecules were used to identify patients who would or would not respond to PD-1 immunotherapy. PD-L1 expression alone was not sufficient to predict which patients would or would not respond to PD-1 immunotherapy. Adding chemokine and immunosuppressive molecule expression profiles allowed patient models to achieve  a greater than 85.0% predictive correlation among predicted and reported patient  clinical responses. Our results suggested that chemokine and immunosuppressive molecule  expression profiles can be used to accurately predict clinical responses thus differentiating among patients who would and would not benefit from PD-1 or PD-L1 immunotherapies."

While the exact pathophysiology remains unknown, corticosteroids are the mainstay of management. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 67-year-old man with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer who developed kidney injury during treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. A kidney biopsy showed ATIN without granuloma formation. Considering their mechanism of action, immune checkpoint inhibitors can alter immunological tolerance to concomitant drugs that have been safely used for a long time. For more than 4 years before the initiation of nivolumab therapy, the  patient had been receiving the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole, known to cause drug-induced ATIN, without significant adverse events including kidney injury. He showed rapid improvement in kidney function in 3 days (creatinine decreased from  2.74 to 1.82 mg/dl) on discontinuation of lansoprazole. He then received 500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days followed by 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone and his creatinine levels eventually stabilized around 1.7 mg/dl. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) for lansoprazole was positive. The rapid improvement of kidney function after discontinuation and DLST positivity indicate that lansoprazole contributed to the development of ATIN during nivolumab therapy. Considering the time course, it is plausible that nivolumab altered the long-lasting immunological tolerance against lansoprazole in this patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of DLST positivity for a drug that had been used safely before the initiation of an  immune checkpoint inhibitor. Although corticosteroid therapy is recommended, the  recognition and discontinuation of concomitant drugs, especially those known to induce ATIN, is necessary for the management of kidney injury associated with anti-PD-1 therapy."

This study assessed PD-L1 status and tumor immune-cell infiltration in  nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in HIV patients. Consecutive HIV patients treated between 1996 and 2014 were enrolled. PD-L1 tumor expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry with two antibodies (clones 5H1 and E1L3N), and tumor immune-cell infiltration with CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD163, and MPO. PD-L1 expression and immune infiltration results  were compared with those of 54 NSCLCs from unknown HIV status patients. Thirty-four HIV-positive patients were evaluated: predominantly men (88.2%) (median age: 51.1 years) presenting stage IV (38.2%) adenocarcinomas (76.5%). The median blood CD4 count was 480 cells/μL (86-1120) and 64% exhibited  undetectable viral load. The PD-L1 score (percentage of positive cells × intensity) was higher in HIV-positive than HIV-undetermined patients with the E1L3N clone [median (range) 0 (0-150) versus 0 (0-26.7), P = 0.047], yet not  with the 5H1 clone [0 (0-120) versus 0 (0-26.7) P = 0.07, respectively]. PD-L1 expression frequency did not differ between both cohorts (18.7 versus 9.3% using  E1L3N and 10 versus 5.6% using 5H1 clone, respectively). There were significantly greater cytotoxic T-cell (P < 0.001), B-lymphocyte (P = 0.005), and activated macrophage (P < 0.001) infiltrations in the HIV-positive patients, but no differences for CD4 T cells. CONCLUSION: Tumors in HIV-positive patients seem to express higher PD-L1 levels with increased immune infiltration, supporting their inclusion in clinical trials assessing immune checkpoint inhibitors."

Previously reported median overall survival (OS) and prices posted by parent company were utilized. The OS gains over controls in days were graded (gr) from A+ to D. Docetaxel costs were calculated for 6-12 cycles and the ICPI for 1 year. Adverse events treatment costs (AEsTC) were reported separately. The cost/life-year gain (C/LYG) was computed as drug yearly-cost/OS gain over control in days × 360 days. The relative value of the ICPI were expressed as $100,000/C/LYG.

Antibodies targeting RANKL have recently been evaluated in combination with anti-CTLA4 in case reports of human melanoma and mouse models of cancer. However, the efficacy  of anti-RANKL in combination with antibodies targeting other immune checkpoint receptors such as PD1 has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that  blockade of RANKL improves anti-metastatic activity of antibodies targeting PD1/PD-L1 and improves subcutaneous growth suppression in mouse models of melanoma, prostate and colon cancer. Suppression of experimental lung metastasis  following combination anti-RANKL with anti-PD1 requires NK cells and IFN-γ, whereas subcutaneous tumor growth suppression with this combination therapy is attenuated in the absence of T cells and IFN-γ. Furthermore, addition of anti-RANKL to anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 resulted in superior anti-tumor responses,  irrespective of the ability of anti-CTLA4 isotype to engage activating FcR, and concurrent or delayed RANKL blockade was most effective. Early-during-treatment assessment reveals this triple combination therapy compared to dual anti-PD1 and  anti-CTLA4 combination therapy further increased the proportion of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that can produce both IFN-γ and TNF. Finally, RANKL expression appears to identify tumor-specific CD8+ T cells expressing higher levels of PD1 which can be modulated by anti-PD1. These data set the scene for clinical evaluation of denosumab use in patients receiving contemporary immune checkpoint blockade."

Many cancer types express PD-L1 and evade immune recognition via the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Precision therapies  targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have the potential to improve response and thereby offer a novel treatment avenue to some patients with cancer. However, this new therapeutic approach requires reliable methods for identifying patients  whose cancers are particularly likely to respond. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review assessing evidence on test validation and scoring algorithms for PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests that might be used to select potentially responsive patients with bladder/urothelial cell, lung, gastric, or ovarian cancers for immunotherapy treatment. METHODS AND To identify evidence on commercially available PD-L1 IHC assays, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase for relevant studies published between January 2010 and September 2016 and appraised abstracts from recent oncology conferences (January 2013 to November 2016). Publications that met the predefined inclusion criteria were extracted and key trends summarized. In total, 26 eligible primary studies were identified, all of which reported on the test validation metrics associated with PD-L1 IHC tests in lung cancer, most  using immunohistochemistry testing. There was significant heterogeneity among the available tests for PD-L1. Specifically, no definitive cutoff for PD-L1 positivity was identifiable, with more than one threshold being reported for most antibodies. Studies also differed as to whether they evaluated tumor cells only or tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. However, all of the tests developed and validated to support a therapeutic drug in the context of phase 2-3 clinical trials reported more than 90% inter-reader concordance. In contrast, other PD-L1 antibodies identified in the literature reported poorer concordance. Published validation metric data for PD-L1 tests are mainly focused  on immunohistochemistry tests from studies in lung cancer. The variability in test cutoffs and standards for PD-L1 testing suggests that there is presently no  standardized approach. This current variability may have implications for the uptake of precision treatments."

Although the immune system is known to recognize these tumor cells, one mechanism by which NSCLC can evade the immune system is via overexpression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Recent clinical trials of PD-1 and PD-L1  inhibitors have returned promising clinical responses. Important for personalizing therapy, patients with higher intensity staining for PD-L1 on tumor biopsies responded better. Thus, there has been interest in using PD-L1 tumor expression as a criterion for patient selection. Currently available methods of screening involve invasive tumor biopsy, followed by histological grading of PD-L1 levels. Biopsies have a high risk of complications, and only allow sampling from limited tumor sections, which may not reflect overall tumor heterogeneity. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) PD-L1 levels could aid in screening patients, and could supplement tissue PD-L1 biopsy results by testing PD-L1 expression from disseminated tumor sites. Towards establishing CTCs as a screening tool, we developed a protocol to isolate CTCs at high purity and immunostain for PD-L1. Monitoring of PD-L1 expression on CTCs could be an additional biomarker for precision medicine that may help in determining response to immunotherapies."

To profile immune cell composition and function in patients with NSCLC and describe the effects of COPD on lung and tumor microenvironments. We profiled resected lung and tumor tissue using flow cytometry and T-cell receptor sequencing in patients with and without COPD from a prospective cohort of patients undergoing resection of NSCLC. A murine cigarette smoke exposure model was used to evaluate the effect on pulmonary immune populations. A separate retrospective cohort of patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) was analyzed, and their survival was quantified. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN We observed an increased number of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ and CD4+ (T-helper cell type 1 [Th1]) lymphocytes in the lungs of patients with COPD. In both humans and mice, increased Th17 content was seen with smoke exposure, but was not associated with the development or severity of COPD. COPD-affected lung tissue displayed increased Th1 differentiation that was recapitulated in the matching tumor sample. PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) expression was increased in tumors of patients with COPD, and the presence of  COPD was associated with progression-free survival in patients treated with ICIs. In patients with COPD, Th1 cell populations were expanded in both lung and tumor microenvironments, and the presence of COPD was associated with longer progression-free intervals in patients treated with ICIs. This has implications for understanding the immune mediators of COPD and developing novel  therapies for NSCLC."

PD-L1 tumour expression and pre-existing tumour T-cell infiltration have been correlated with improved clinical outcomes to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1. However, patients with tumours that are negative for PD-L1 expression can also respond to treatment. Strategies to combine other treatment modalities like radiotherapy (RT) with immune checkpoint inhibitors are being investigated as means of improving the response rates to PD-1/PD-L1 antibody blockade. RT induces immunogenic changes in cancer cells, can adaptively upregulate tumour cell PD-L1 expression and can improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy. How we design future clinical trials in NSCLC also  depends on practical considerations of delivering these treatment combinations, such as RT dose, fractionation and field volume, as well as scheduling with immune checkpoint blockade. Here, we review reasons for resistance to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 and how RT may be utilised in combination with these drugs to enhance their effect by building better translational research platforms."

Western blot and IHC using cell lines and human tissues were used to validate these clones. From all PD-L1 antibodies, only the clones E1L3N, E1J2J, SP142, 28-8, 22C3, and SP263 passed the Western blot and IHC validation, providing similar pattern than the clone 5H1 and then they were tested in 259 non-small cell lung cancer cases placed in 9 tissue microarrays. Among all cases, only those with ≥2 cores were included (185 cases). Positive and significant correlation was found between the median PD-L1 H-score in tumor and stroma compartments, for all selected antibodies. Overall, 56 of 185 cases were detected as positive cases in malignant cells expressing membranous PD-L1 by all  the clones. However, the clone SP263 identified more PD-L1-positive cases compared with the other clones. Our results show that clones E1L3N, E1J2J, SP142, 28-8, 22C3, and SP263 provide positive membrane staining pattern comparable with  clone 5H1. These commercial clones are comparable, but a careful evaluation by the pathologist is necessary to minimize error of positive misinterpretations."

TUSC2 delivered systemically by nanovesicles has mediated tumor regression in clinical trials. Because of the role of TUSC2 in regulating immune  cells, we assessed TUSC2 efficacy on antitumor immune responses alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 in two Kras-mutant syngeneic mouse lung cancer models. TUSC2 alone significantly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with anti-PD-1. When combined, this effect was significantly enhanced, and correlated with a pronounced increases in circulating and splenic natural killer  (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells, and a decrease in regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T-cell checkpoint receptors PD-1, CTLA-4, and TIM-3. TUSC2 combined with anti-PD-1 induced tumor infiltrating more  than NK and CD8+ T cells and fewer MDSCs and Tregs than each agent alone, both in subcutaneous tumor and in lung metastases. NK-cell depletion abrogated the antitumor effect and Th1-mediated immune response of this combination, indicating that NK cells mediate TUSC2/anti-PD-1 synergy. Release of IL15 and IL18 cytokines and expression of the IL15Rα chain and IL18R1 were associated with NK-cell activation by TUSC2. Immune response-related gene expression in the tumor microenvironment was altered by combination treatment. These data provide a rationale for immunogene therapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade in the  treatment of NSCLC."

Interruption of immune checkpoints, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, has been verified to be a successful means for cancer therapy in clinical trials. mAb targeting PD-L1 has been approved to treat urothelial carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or Merkel cell carcinoma by the FDA. However, the high cost of the antibody can limit its application. In our study, targeting PD-L1 peptide (TPP-1), which specifically binds to PD-L1 with high affinity, was identified through bacterial surface display methods. Using a T-cell activation assay and mixed lymphocyte reaction, TPP-1 was verified to interfere with the interaction of PD-1/PD-L1. To examine the inhibitory effect of TPP-1 on tumor growth in vivo, a xenograft mouse model using H460 cells was established. The growth rate of tumor masses in TPP-1 or PD-L1 antibody-treated mice was 56% or 71% lower than that in control peptide-treated mice, respectively, indicating that TPP-1 inhibits, or at least retards, tumor growth. IHC of the tumors showed that IFNγ and granzyme B expression increased in the TPP-1 or PD-L1 antibody-treated groups, indicating that TPP-1 attenuates the inhibitory effect of PD-L1 on T cells and that T cells may get reactivated. On the basis of our data, TPP-1 peptide could work as an alternative to antibodies for tumor immunotherapy."

Vascular-targeted photodynamic (VTP) therapy with the photosensitizer WST11 induces a defined local immune response, and we sought to determine whether this could potentiate the local and systemic antitumor response to PD-1 pathway inhibition.Experimental Design: Using an orthotopic Renca murine model of renal cell carcinoma that develops lung metastases, we treated primary renal tumors with either VTP alone, PD-1/PD-L1 antagonistic antibodies alone, or a combination of VTP and antibodies and then examined treatment responses, including immune infiltration in primary and metastatic sites. Modulation of PD-L1 expression by VTP in human xenograft tumors was also assessed.Results: Treatment of renal tumors with VTP in combination with systemic PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition, but neither treatment alone, resulted in  regression of primary tumors, prevented growth of lung metastases, and prolonged  survival in a preclinical mouse model. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed that treatment effect was associated with increased CD8+:regulatory T cell (Treg) and CD4+FoxP3-:Treg ratios in primary renal tumors and increased T-cell infiltration in sites of lung metastasis. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression is induced following VTP treatment of human renal cell carcinoma xenografts.Our results demonstrate a role for local immune modulation with VTP in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition for generation of potent local and systemic antitumor responses. This combined modality strategy may be an effective therapy in cancers resistant to PD-1/PD-L1  pathway inhibition alone."

Activating the body's own immune system  has added a novel and powerful therapeutic option for the treatment of melanoma and lung cancer. Furthermore, the potential use of immunotherapy is being extensively explored also in other malignancies. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: This review summarises current clinical studies using immune checkpoint modulators for the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNSCC). TYPE OF REVIEW: Systematic review. SEARCH STRATEGY: A PubMed search from 2010 onwards was performed for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical trials of HNSCC. An equivalent search was performed at clinicaltrials.gov. Additionally, the abstracts from the annual  meetings of the ASCO, ESMO and AACR were screened. A total of 45 relevant studies using immune checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC were identified. In the majority of these studies, antagonistic antibodies  targeting the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 are used either solely or combined, mostly with other immunomodulatory antibodies, such as inhibitors of CTLA-4. Most studies are still recruiting patients (26/45). In the primary setting, we identified 16 studies using checkpoint inhibition as neoadjuvant/adjuvant modality for treatment with curative intent. The response rate upon treatment with PD-1 antagonists in relation to the PD-L1 status is being investigated in 12 trials. Novel immune checkpoint modulators combined with the inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis or CTLA-4 have been set up in six trials. So far, only four studies that use immune checkpoint inhibition in HNSCC have presented results and all of these explored the inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. The studies demonstrated overall response rates (ORR) in the range of 20%.  These preliminary data suggest that a PD-L1 expression ≥1% is associated with a higher response rate compared to a PD-L1 expression ≤1%. The anti-PD-1-antibody pembrolizumab extended the duration of response in recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC (by approximately 53 weeks) in a phase Ib study. Therefore, pembrolizumab was granted accelerated approval for the treatment of platinum refractory R/M HNSCC by the FDA. CONCLUSION: Numerous clinical trials are addressing the suitability and efficacy  of immune checkpoint modulators in HNSCC with the predominant targets being the established immune checkpoint receptors PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Recently, presented results have shown a survival benefit, a favourable safety profile and  an extended duration of response in favour of using immune checkpoint modulation  in R/M HNSCC."

However, limited understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 has become one of the biggest challenges for further improving efficacy. In this study, we observed that in wild-type EFGR cell lines A549 and H460, the ubiquitin ligases Cbl-b and c-Cbl inhibit PD-L1 by  inactivating STAT, AKT, and ERK signaling. MiR-181a and miR-940 were screened and validated to target Cbl-b and c-Cbl, respectively. Furthermore, in NSCLC tissues, the expression of Cbl-b/c-Cbl is negatively correlated with PD-L1 expression. Taken together, these findings indicated a new regulatory mechanism for PD-L1 in  wild-type EGFR NSCLC cell lines by Cbl-b and c-Cbl."

This has since developed into cell therapy including lymphokine-activated killer cells(LAK)and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes(TIL), as well as cancer vaccine therapy. However, no clear indication of effectiveness has been reported. Despite the high expectation over the effectiveness of cancer vaccine therapy, the treatment strategy was deemed unsuccessful, and focus turned to the study of immune escape mechanism, which is now regarded as standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. With  the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors, cancer immunotherapy has finally become a standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. There are still several obstacles to overcome including the identification of a predictive biomarker for improved efficacy, as well as the establishment of multidrug or multimodality combination therapy. PD-L1 expression is currently used as a predictive biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy, but does not meet the expectations of the aimed results. Although tumor mutation burden is considered another promising biomarker, there remain clinical problems, for example the need of next generation sequencer. It was reported that combination therapy of immune checkpoint inhibitor after chemoradiation therapy was also effective. However, it remains unclear of what is required to further improve the clinical effects.

The kappa coefficient was 0.53, 0.58, and 0.46 for SP263 vs. SP142, SP263 vs. UMAB228, and SP142 vs. UMAB228, respectively. On the other hand, the univariate analysis of consensus cases indicated that the PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with tobacco use (χ2=4.25, P=0.04). The analytical comparison showed moderate concordance between SP142, SP263 and UMAB228, whereas SP263 exhibited higher overall positive rate. Moreover, PD-L1 positive rate was significantly higher in patients with smoking history, which might help in identifying patients who would benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors."

Adaptive immune resistance confers tumour resistance to immunosurveillance through these immune checkpoints.

A better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the immune system led to the development of antibodies directed against immune checkpoints such as PD-L1. The first encouraging clinical data from phase I studies assessing anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have been confirmed in randomised phase III trials. These new drugs now constitute a standard second-line treatment for  metastatic tumours and in the future, at least for pembrolizumab, in the first line. Their adjuvant role after locoregional treatment with curative intent is currently under investigation."

Especially within oncology, more and more drugs are being developed together with a predictive biomarker assay using the drug-diagnostic codevelopment model. Not only do these assays support the development process but also the use of the drugs after regulatory approval as an important treatment decision tool. When these predictive biomarker assays are linked to a specific drug, they are called companion diagnostics. Furthermore, these assays are also considered an important element in the realization of precision medicine. Today, 21 different drugs have obtained US FDA approval together with a companion diagnostic assay, and the requirement for testing is part of their regulatory labeling. More than half of these drugs are for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With the approval of the different programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors, for the treatment of advanced stage NSCLC, a new class of predictive biomarker assays-complementary diagnostics-has emerged. Until now, 3 immune checkpoint inhibitors have obtained regulatory approval for treatment of NSCLC, and they all have a biomarker assay linked to their use. However, only for pembrolizumab, the PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) 22C3 pharmDx assay has status as a companion diagnostic. For nivolumab and atezolizumab, the assays PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx and Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) have status as complementary diagnostics, which means that there are no requirements for testing included in the labeling for these drugs. Here, the authors discuss the clinical  performance of the different IHC PD-L1 expression assays including the selection  of the clinical cutoff values."

Despite decades of active research, treatment options for SCLC are limited and resistance to the few Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies develops rapidly. With no approved targeted agents to date, new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. SCLC  is characterized by high mutation burden, ubiquitous loss of TP53 and RB1, mutually exclusive amplification of MYC family members, thereby, high genomic instability. Studies in the past few years have demonstrated the potential of targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway as a promising therapeutic strategy for SCLC. Inhibitors targeting DDR proteins have shown promise in preclinical models, and are under clinical investigation as single agents and in  combination with cytotoxic therapies. Recent efforts to expand the therapeutic arsenal toward SCLC have focused in part on immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as agents targeting the receptor-ligand pair programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)  and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Clinical trials have confirmed activity of these agents in extensive stage (ES)-SCLC. However, while several patients had dramatic responses, overall response rates to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) remain poor. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop rational combination therapies to enhance response rates to immunotherapy in SCLC. Identification of predictive biomarkers for patient stratification, identifying effective combinations to overcome adaptive resistance to DDR-targeted therapies and identifying strategies to enhance response to immunotherapy are areas of active investigation in SCLC."

[Epub ahead of print]","Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Nivolumab and Radiotherapy in Pretreated Lung Cancer  Patients: Efficacy and Safety of Combination.","In the last decade, the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, has revolutionized the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Concurrent radiotherapy (RT) is of particular interest in showing the potential role of the combination. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the addition of RT to an immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, with regard to activity and feasibility in pretreated, advanced, or metastatic lung cancer patients at our center. We retrospectively identified 35 consecutive patients (30 men and 5 women), who received nivolumab for pretreated NSCLC, between March 2015 to December 2016. Fifteen received hypofractionated RT as a palliative measure, and, in these patients, nivolumab was administered at an interval of at least 1 week from the end of RT. The median age was 69 years, and 23 patients (65.7%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to 1. All patients had previously received at least 1 systemic regimen, and, for only 3 (8.6%), nivolumab was a third-line treatment. The 2 treatment arms, RT-nivolumab and only-nivolumab, were well matched for baseline characteristics. At a median follow-up of 7.4 months, the 1-year overall survival rates were 57.8% for patients treated with RT-nivolumab and 27.4% for patients treated with only-nivolumab (P=0.043). The 1-year progression-free survival in the RT-nivolumab group was 57.8% and 20.6% in the only-nivolumab group (P=0.040). No difference in adverse events was detected. In conclusion, RT and nivolumab can be combined, obtaining a benefit in overall survival and progression-free survival, without an increase in acute toxicities in pretreated advanced NSCLC patients. Prospective studies are needed  to confirm these results."

We report the case of a 79-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer on anti-PD-1 therapy nivolumab. After the 4th administration of nivolumab, the treatment course was complicated with normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urine and blood  studies were in favor of distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Following a negative workup for an underlying etiology, immunotherapy-induced RTA was suspected. Withholding of the offending agent and initiation of steroid therapy resulted in adequate response. The present report provides the first presentation of RTA as a renal immune-related adverse event secondary to nivolumab.

Biomarkers that can predict response, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), are in the spotlight of many studies. This cohort study was designed to evaluate the role of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs as predictive factors for response to anti PD-1 treatment in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic melanoma. We evaluated the expression of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs in tissue samples of  56 patients with metastatic NSCLC or melanoma treated with anti-PD1 immunotherapy. The study included 30 patients with melanoma and 26 with NSCLC. An association was found between CD8+/CD4+ TILs ratio and response to anti-PD1 treatment in both cancers. Regarding melanoma patients, ratios of CD8+/CD4+ lower than 2 predicted lack of response to treatment (0%) (p = 0.006), while CD8+/CD4+  ratios higher than 2.7 had an 81.3% response rate (p = 0.0001). In addition, we found that the presence of more than 1900/mm2 of CD8+ lymphocytes in the melanoma tumor predicted a 90% response to therapy. In the metastatic NSCLC group, tumors  with CD8+ lymphocyte count under 886/mm2 showed low response rates (16.7%, p = 0.046). When the CD8+ lymphocyte count was in the range of 886-1899/mm2, the  response rate was high (60%, p = 0.017). In CD8+/CD4+ ratios lower than 2, the response rate was low (13.3%), and in ratios higher than 2, response rates ranged between 43 and 50% (p = 0.035). The use of CD8+/CD4+ TILs ratios in tumor biopsies may predict response to anti-PD1 treatment in metastatic melanoma and NSCLC."

We hypothesize that the local immune micro-environment of NSCLC is associated with patient outcomes and that these local immune features exhibit distinct radiologic characteristics discernible by quantitative imaging metrics.  We assembled two cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with definitive surgical resection and extracted quantitative parameters from pretreatment CT imaging. The excised primary tumors were then quantified for percent tumor PDL1 expression and density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (via CD3 count) utilizing immunohistochemistry and automated cell counting. Associating these pretreatment  radiomics parameters with tumor immune parameters, we developed an immune pathology-informed model (IPIM) that separated patients into 4 clusters (designated A-D) utilizing 4 radiomics features. The IPIM designation was significantly associated with overall survival in both training (5 year OS: 61%,  41%, 50%, and 91%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P = 0.04) and validation (5 year OS: 55%, 72%, 75%, and 86%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P = 0.002) cohorts and immune pathology (all P < 0.05). Specifically, we identified a favorable outcome group characterized by low CT intensity and high heterogeneity  that exhibited low PDL1 and high CD3 infiltration, suggestive of a favorable immune activated state. We have developed a NSCLC radiomics signature based on the immune micro-environment and patient outcomes. This manuscript demonstrates model creation and validation in independent cohorts."

However, its administration is complicated by immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including pneumonitis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case series of four patients with malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and hypopharyngeal carcinoma who demonstrated pneumonitis induced by nivolumab, and further review clinicopathological characteristics of these patients in comparison with those of previously reported patients with nivolumab-induced pneumonitis. In our series, 20% of patients who were treated with nivolumab developed pneumonitis, all of which occurred approximately 2 weeks after the initiation of nivolumab treatment. Prompt recognition of the nivolumab-induced pneumonitis allowed for successful resolution. Computed tomography scan images of the patients demonstrated predominantly cryptogenic organizing pneumonia patterns. All patients were males, who had been heavily treated with antitumor drugs prior to nivolumab. Our case series showed that nivolumab had a high incidence of drug-induced pneumonitis with early onset, supporting the need for renewed attention to nivolumab-induced pneumonitis, particularly in patients with a history of heavy antitumor treatments."

Investigators reported AEs on trial and graded them according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0, labeling them as unlikely, possibly, or probably treatment-related. AEs labeled as possibly/probably related were considered trAEs for this analysis. The relationship between the incidence of a trAE and clinical outcomes was evaluated. Ninety-seven NSCLC patients treated on KEYNOTE-001 at the University of California, Los Angeles were evaluated. Ten percent (85/826) of AEs were trAEs, occurring in 40% (39/97) of patients. The most frequent trAEs were rash (21% patients), fatigue (6% patients), and hypothyroidism (6% patients). The 39 patients that experienced a trAE had increased objective response rate (ORR, 38.5%), progression-free survival (PFS: median, 248 days), and overall survival (OS: median, 493 days), compared with the 58 patients that did not (ORR: 8.9%, PFS: median 60 days, OS: median 144.5 days). The observed association between trAEs and improved clinical  outcome persisted when using Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess the confounding effect of covariates and mitigate guarantee-time bias. The association also remained when data were substratified by grade, degree of association, and treatment-related select AE designation. This single-center analysis revealed that trAEs predicted for improved clinical outcome with pembrolizumab, and when controlling for guarantee-time bias and plausible confounders, this association remained. This observed relationship adds to our understanding of anti-PD-1 therapy and could aid clinicians in identifying patients most likely to benefit from therapy."

Currently, immunotherapy was clinically  validated as effective treatment option for many tumors such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Some surface receptors of immune cells, called immune checkpoint receptors, may inhibit activity of proinflammatory lymphocytes, following binding with specific ligands. Cancer cells exploit these mechanisms to inactivate tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to escape from immunosurveillance. Among the different tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations, including leucocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells, TILs are considered a selected population of T-cells with a higher specific immunological reactivity against tumor cells than  the non-infiltrating lymphocytes. In this review we will discuss the promising role of TILs as biomarkers reflecting the immune response to the tumor, describing their potential ability to predict the prognosis and clinical outcome  of immunotherapy in some solid tumors."

The objective of this study was to describe the predictive value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) on the efficacy of nivolumab in advanced NSCLC. We prospectively included all consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab in our Department between June 2015 and October 2016. Plasma samples were obtained before the first injection of nivolumab and at the first tumor evaluation with nivolumab. ctDNA was analyzed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the predominant somatic mutation was followed for each patient and correlated with tumor response, clinical benefit (administration of nivolumab for more than 6 months), and progression-free survival (PFS). Of 23 patients, 15 had evaluable NGS results at both times of analysis. ctDNA concentration at the first tumor evaluation and ctDNA change correlated with tumor response, clinical benefit and PFS. ROC curve analyses showed good diagnostic performances for tumor response and clinical benefit, both for ctDNA concentration at the first tumor evaluation (tumor response: positive predictive value (PPV) at 100.0% and negative predictive value (NPV) at 71.0%; clinical benefit: PPV at 83.3% and NPV 77.8%) and the ctDNA change (tumor response: PPV 100.0% and NPV 62.5%; clinical benefit: PPV 100.0% and NPV 80.0%).  Patients without ctDNA concentration increase >9% at 2 months had a long-term benefit of nivolumab. In conclusion, NGS analysis of ctDNA allows the early detection of tumor response and long-term clinical benefit with nivolumab in NSCLC."

Their expression and regulation are still not fully characterized and a better understanding of these mechanisms is needed to improve current immunotherapies. Our previous work has identified a novel ligand/receptor pair, LLT1/CD161, that modulates immune responses. Here, we extensively characterize its expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show that LLT1 expression is restricted to germinal center (GC) B cells within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), representing a new hallmark of the presence of active TLS in the tumor microenvironment. CD161-expressing immune cells are found at the vicinity of these structures, with a global enrichment of NSCLC tumors in CD161+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as compared to normal distant lung and peripheral blood. CD161+ CD4+ T cells are more activated and produce Th1-cytokines at a higher frequency than their matched CD161-negative counterparts. Interestingly, CD161+ CD4+ T cells highly express OX40 co-stimulatory receptor, less frequently 4-1BB, and display an activated but not completely exhausted PD-1-positive Tim-3-negative phenotype. Finally, a meta-analysis revealed a positive association of CLEC2D (coding for LLT1) and KLRB1 (coding for CD161) gene expression with favorable outcome in NSCLC, independently of the size of T and B cell infiltrates. These data are consistent with a positive impact of LLT1/CD161 on NSCLC patient survival, and make CD161-expressing CD4+ T cells ideal candidates for efficient anti-tumor recall responses."

We validated this observation by detecting PD-1 transcript in lung cancer cells and by co-localizing PD-1 and lung cancer-specific markers in resected lung cancer tissues. We further investigated the biological role of cancer-intrinsic PD-1 in a mouse lung cancer  cell line, M109. Knockout or antibody blockade of PD-1 enhanced M109 viability in-vitro, while PD-1 overexpression and exposure to recombinant PD-L1 diminished  viability.

In this context, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated survival benefits in numerous cancers, including melanoma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma. PD-1-expressing CD8+ T lymphocytes appear to play a major role in the  response to these immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) eliminate malignant cells through recognition by the T-cell receptor (TCR)  of specific antigenic peptides presented on the surface of cancer cells by major  histocompatibility complex class I/beta-2-microglobulin complexes, and through killing of target cells, mainly by releasing the content of secretory lysosomes containing perforin and granzyme B. T-cell adhesion molecules and, in particular, lymphocyte-function-associated antigen-1 and CD103 integrins, and their cognate ligands, respectively, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and E-cadherin, on target cells, are involved in strengthening the interaction between CTL and tumor cells. Tumor-specific CTL have been isolated from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes  and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of patients with varied cancers. TCRβ-chain gene usage indicated that CTL identified in vitro selectively expanded in vivo at the tumor site compared to autologous PBL. Moreover, functional studies indicated that these CTL mediate human leukocyte antigen class I-restricted cytotoxic activity toward autologous tumor cells. Several of them recognize truly tumor-specific antigens encoded by mutated genes, also known as neoantigens, which likely play a key role in antitumor CD8 T-cell immunity. Accordingly, it has been shown that the presence of T lymphocytes directed toward tumor neoantigens is associated with patient response to immunotherapies, including ICI, adoptive cell transfer, and dendritic cell-based vaccines. These tumor-specific mutation-derived antigens open up new perspectives for development of effective second-generation therapeutic cancer vaccines."

The role of inflammation-associated transcription factors STAT3, IKBKE, STAT1 and other associated genes has also been examined. Methods: Total RNA from 17 NSCLC and 21 melanoma patients was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. STAT3 and Rantes, YAP1 and CXCL5, DNMT1,  RIG1 and TET1, EOMES, IFNG, PD-L1 and CTLA4, IKBKE and NFATC1 mRNA were examined. PD-L1 protein expression in tumor and immune cells and stromal infiltration of CD8+ T-cells were also evaluated. Progression-free survival and overall survival  were estimated. Results: A total of 17 NSCLC patients received nivolumab and 21 melanoma patients received pembrolizumab. Progression-free survival with nivolumab was significantly longer in NSCLC patients with high versus low IFNG expression (5.1  months versus 2 months, p = 0.0124). Progression-free survival with pembrolizumab was significantly longer in melanoma patients with high versus low IFNG expression (5.0 months versus 1.9 months, p = 0.0099). Significantly longer overall survival was observed for melanoma patients with high versus low IFNG expression (not reached versus 10.2 months p = 0.0183). There was a trend for longer overall survival for NSCLC patients with high versus low IFNG expression. IFN-γ is an important marker for prediction of response to immune checkpoint blockade. Further research is warranted in order to validate whether IFNG is more accurate than PD-L1."

Small animal PET/CT studies showed that 89Zr-C4 detected antigen levels on a patient derived xenograft (PDX) established from a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient before an 8-month response to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 therapy. Importantly, the  concentration of antigen is beneath the detection limit of previously developed anti-PD-L1 radiotracers, including radiolabeled atezolizumab. We also show that 89Zr-C4 can specifically detect antigen in human NSCLC and prostate cancer models endogenously expressing a broad range of PD-L1. 89Zr-C4 detects mouse PD-L1 expression changes in immunocompetent mice, suggesting that endogenous PD-1/2 will not confound human imaging. Lastly, we found that 89Zr-C4 could detect acute changes in tumor expression of PD-L1 due to standard of care chemotherapies. In summary, we present evidence that low levels of PD-L1 in clinically relevant cancer models can be imaged with immunoPET using a novel recombinant human antibody."

An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC. A formal systematic analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2.2). Clinical and demographic characteristics, response, and toxicity data were compared between both groups. A total of 23 studies reported between 2013 and 2016 were eligible for analysis. The total number of patients evaluated for toxicities was 3284 patients in the PD-1 group and 2460 patients in the PD-L1 group. The baseline patient characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, although there was a trend toward increased squamous histology in the group treated with PD-L1 (32% vs 25%; P = .6). There was no difference in response rate noted between PD-1 (19%) and PD-L1  (18.6%) inhibitors (P = .17).

To determine whether distinct tissue immune microenvironments differentially affect clinical outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an extended analysis of PD-L1 and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) was performed.Experimental Design: Samples from resected adenocarcinoma (ADC 42), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC 58), and 26 advanced diseases (13 ADC and 13 SCC) treated with nivolumab were analyzed. PD-L1 expression and the incidence of CD3, CD8, CD4, PD-1, CD57, FOXP3, CD25, and Granzyme B TILs were immunohistochemically assessed.Results: PD-L1 levels inversely correlated with N involvement, although they did not show a statistically significant prognostic value in resected patients. The incidence and phenotype of TILs differed in SCC versus ADC, in which EGFR and KRAS mutations conditioned a different frequency and tissue localization of lymphocytes. NSCLC resected patients with high CD8pos lymphocytes lacking PD-1 inhibitory receptor had a longer overall survival (OS: HR = 2.268; 95% CI, 1.056-4.871, P = 0.03). PD-1-to-CD8 ratio resulted in a prognostic factor both on univariate (HR = 1.952; 95% CI, 1.34-3.12, P = 0.001) and multivariate (HR = 1.943; 95% CI, 1.38-2.86, P = 0.009) analysis. Moreover, low PD-1 incidence among CD8pos cells was a distinctive feature of nivolumab-treated patients, showing clinical benefit with a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS: HR = 4.51; 95%  CI, 1.45-13.94, P = 0.004).In the presence of intrinsic variability  in PD-L1 expression, the reservoir of PD-1-negative effector T lymphocytes provides an immune-privileged microenvironment with a positive impact on survival of patients with resected disease and response to immunotherapy in advanced NSCLC."

Chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression allowed for complete resolution of the patient's pre-existing LP, a T-cell mediatedautoimmune process. When the patient was switched to nivolumab immunotherapy owing to progression of NSCLC, PD-1 inhibition led to an overwhelming T-cell response that seemed to have provoked a severe LPreactivation. Although lichenoid reactions have been reported with nivolumab, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nivolumab monotherapycausing LP reactivation in a patient with a strong personal and family history of the disease that was previously in remission after chemotherapy."

The current study investigated the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTCs isolated from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with chemotherapy. Patients and methods: CTCs were isolated from 30 chemo-naïve stage IV NSCLC patients before and after front-line chemotherapy using the ISET filtration platform. CTCs were detected by Giemsa and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Samples were analyzed with the ARIOL system. Results: Giemsa staining revealed that 28 (93.3%) out of 30 and 9 (81.8%) out of  11 patients had detectable CTCs at baseline and after the third chemotherapy cycle, respectively. Cytokeratin (CK)+/CD45- CTCs by IF could be detected in 17 of 30 (56.7%) patients at baseline and in 8 of 11 (72.7%) after the third chemotherapy cycle. Spearman analysis revealed a significant correlation (p = 0.001) between Giemsa-positive and IF-positive (CK+/CD45-) CTCs. At baseline, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression was observed in 53% and in 47% CK-positive patients, respectively. After the third treatment cycle the corresponding numbers were 13%  and 63% respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly shorter in patients with >3 PD-1(+) CTCs at baseline compared with those with <3  PD-1(+) CTCs (p = 0.022) as well as in patients with >1 Giemsa-positive tumor cells (p = 0.025). PD-1(+) and PD-L1(+) CTCs could be detected before and after front-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC.

Nonetheless, the differences in efficacy between PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors and conventional treatments (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) in pretreated advanced cancer patients remain unclear. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs)-based investigations of PD-1(nivolumab, pembrolizumab)/PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab) against pretreated advanced cancer. We evaluated these trials for inclusion, assessed each study's risk of bias and selected relevant data for analysis. Results: The eligibility criteria were met by 5,093 patients from 8 phase III RCTs. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly extended overall survival relative to the conventional treatment, expressed as hazard ratio [HR] (0.72, 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.77, P < 0.001) and median month difference (2.83 months, 95% CI, 1.87 to 3.78,  P < 0.001).

This study was to analyze the correlation between MDSC subsets and CCL2 level in lung cancer model. G-MDSC and M-MDSC from the blood and parenchyma were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blot in the lung tumor model. CCL2 was detected by ELISA assay, real-time PCR, western blot and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of combination treatment combining CCL2 antagonist and anti-PD1 antibody  were assessed. Results showed that MDSC subsets had a positive correlation with CCL2, suggesting CCL2 may attract MDSC into the parenchyma. Gene and protein expression of CCL2, as well as the CCL2 surface expression significantly increased in blood and tumor of tumor-bearing mice. Anti-CCL2 treatment decreased G-MDSC and M-MDSC in the periphery and tumor through inhibiting the protein expression of arginase 1 and iNOS. In addition, combination therapy enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration, as well as the production of interferon gamma (IFNγ), and increased the survival time of tumor-bearing mice.

To support its development, preclinical experiments were performed with either TG4010 or β-galactosidase-encoding MVA vector (MVA-βgal) in mice presenting tumors in the lung. Tumor growth was obtained after intravenous injection of CT26 murine colon  cancer cells, engineered to express either MUC1 or βgal. Mice showed increased survival rates after repeated intravenous injections of TG4010 or MVA-βgal, compared to an empty MVA control vector. Treatment with MVA vectors led to the accumulation of CD3dimCD8dim T cells, with two subpopulations characterized as KLRG1+CD127- short-lived effector cells (SLECs), and KLRG1-CD127- early effector  cells (EECs) comprising cells releasing IFNγ, Granzyme B and CD107a upon antigen-specific peptide stimulation. EECs were characterized by an up-regulation of PD-1. Tumor growth in the diseased lung correlated with the appearance of PD1+ Treg cells that partially disappeared after TG4010 treatment. At late stage of tumor development in the lung, PD-L1 was detected on CD45- tumor cells, on CD4+ cells, including Treg cells, on CD3+CD8+ and CD3dimCD8dim T lymphocytes, on NK cells, on MDSCs and on alveolar macrophages. We demonstrated that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway with blocking monoclonal antibodies several days after TG4010  treatment, at late stage of tumor development, enhanced the therapeutic protection induced by the vaccine, supporting the ongoing clinical evaluation of  TG4010 immunotherapy in combination with Nivolumab."

The effects of ICIs depend on the patient performance status; age, sex, histology; the presence of brain metastases have not modified treatment results. ICIs therapy is safe and well tolerated; immune related adverse events are observed. Pneumonitis may be a serious and fatal complication, but glucocorticoids are usually curative.

We investigated the utility of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating white  blood cells (WBCs) as a noninvasive method to evaluate PD-L1 status in advanced NSCLC patients. Patients and methods: CTCs and circulating WBCs were enriched from peripheral blood samples (ISET® platform; Rarecells) from 106 NSCLC patients. PD-L1 expression on ISET filters and matched-tumor tissue was evaluated by automated immunostaining (SP142 antibody; Ventana), and quantified in tumor cells and WBCs. Results: CTCs were detected in 80 (75%) patients, with levels ranging from 2 to 256 CTCs/4 ml, and median of 60 CTCs/4 ml. Among 71 evaluable samples with matched-tissue and CTCs, 6 patients (8%) showed ≥1 PD-L1-positive CTCs and 11 patients (15%) showed ≥1% PD-L1-positive tumor cells in tumor tissue with 93% concordance between tissue and CTCs (sensitivity = 55%; specificity = 100%). From 74 samples with matched-tissue and circulating WBCs, 40 patients (54%) showed ≥1% PD-L1-positive immune infiltrates in tumor tissue and 39 patients (53%) showed ≥1% PD-L1 positive in circulating WBCs, with 80% concordance between blood and tissue (sensitivity = 82%; specificity = 79%). We found a trend for worse survival in patients receiving first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy treatments, whose tumors express PD-L1 in CTCs or immune cells (progression-free  and overall survival), similar to the effects of PD-L1 expression in matched-patient tumors. These results demonstrated that PD-L1 status in CTCs and circulating WBCs correlate with PD-L1 status in tumor tissue, revealing the potential of CTCs assessment as a noninvasive real-time biopsy to evaluate PD-L1 expression in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC."

Among several checkpoint receptors of immune cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4),  programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), T-cell immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) are the most commonly targeted checkpoints for cancer immunotherapy. Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main problem with checkpoint blockers is that only a fraction of patients respond to the therapy. Insufficient immune activation is considered as  one of the main reason for low response rates and combination of checkpoint blockers has been proposed to increase the response rates. The combination of checkpoint blockers was successful in melanoma but had significant adverse events. A combination that is selected based on the mechanistic differences between checkpoints and the differences in expression of checkpoints and their ligands in the tumor microenvironment could have a synergistic effect in a given  cancer subtype and also have a manageable safety profile. This review aims to help in design of optimal checkpoint blocker combinations by discussing the mechanistic details and outlining the subtle differences between major checkpoints targeted for cancer immunotherapy."

Also, ceRNAs (competing endogenous RNA) would be the newest and the most effective approach to uncover novel interactions between mRNAs and miRNAs in NSCLC carcinogenesis. There are many factors influencing the efficiency of a miRNA to suppress or silence translation  of the target mRNA. The most effective event is the presence of other RNAs showing ceRNA activity. These RNAs contain binding sites for specific miRNAs and  enable miRNAs to bind these pseudo targets, instead of the original binding sites on the target mRNA. Therefore, the mRNA of the target gene is less affected by this miRNA, while the amount of miRNA remains the same in the media. METHOD: For this project, we determined that five clinically important different  oncogenes (PDL1, FGFR1, DDX3X, SLC1A5, FXR1 ) are involved in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. For this purpose, we transfected model NSCLC cell line, A549, with miRNAs  (miR-150-5p, miR-15a-5p, miR-503-5p) targeting these oncogenes to investigate whether these oncogenes will be suppressed at the mRNA level and also how the suppression efficiency of these miRNA on the oncogenes will be affected by possible ceRNA (CNKSR3, POU2F1, HIPK2) activities. miR-15a-5p was determined to have the most suppressive effect on the five genes and three potential ceRNAs (p<0.05). Furthermore, CNKSR3 was the ceRNA most affected by all three miRNAs (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: CNKSR3 was affected more than the oncogenes known to act on NSCLC and this might make it a stronger and novel marker for use in possible treatment regimens designed using miR-15a-5p silencing effect on oncogenes in NSCLC pathogenesis. According to the literature, this is the first study associating NSCLC with miR-15a-5p and CNKSR3."

The discovery of molecular changes that drive lung cancer has led to a dramatic shift in the therapeutic landscape of this disease. In in vitro and in vivo models of NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer), angiogenesis blockade has demonstrated an excellent anti-tumor activity, thus, a number of anti-angiogenic  drugs have been approved by regulatory authorities for use in clinical practice.  Much more interesting is the discovery of EGFR (Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor) mutations that predict sensitivity to the anti-EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs), a class of drugs that has shown to significantly improve survival when compared with standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of  metastatic NSCLC. Nevertheless, after an initial response, resistance often occurs and prognosis becomes dismal. Biomolecular studies on cell line models have led to the discovery of mutations (e.g., T790M) that confer resistance to anti-EGFR inhibitors. Fortunately, drugs that are able to circumvent this mechanism of resistance have been developed and have been recently approved for clinical use. The discovery of robust intratumor lymphocyte infiltration in NSCLC has paved the way to several strategies able to restore the immune response. Thus, agents interfering with PD-1/PD-L1 (Programmed Death) pathways make up a significant portion of the armamentarium of cancer therapies for NSCLC. In all the above-mentioned situations, the basis of the success in treating NSCLC has started from understanding of the mutational landscape of the tumor."

When estimating TMB, targeted panel sequencing is performed using a few hundred genes; however, a comparison of TMB results obtained with this platform and with whole exome sequencing (WES) has not been performed for various cancer types. In the present study, we compared TMB results using the above two platforms in 2,908 solid tumors that were obtained from Japanese patients. For next-generation sequencing, we used fresh-frozen tissue specimens. The Ion Proton System was employed to detect somatic mutations in the coding genome and to sequence an available cancer panel that targeted 409 genes. We then selected 2,040 samples with sufficient tumor cellularity for TMB analysis. In tumors with TMB-high (TMB  ≥ 20 mutations/Mb), TMB derived from WES correlated well with the estimated TMB (eTMB) based on panel sequencing, whereas TMB in the remaining tumors showed a weak correlation. In particular, eTMB was overestimated in tumors with low-frequency mutations, resulting in the accumulation of EGFR mutations not being discriminated as a feature of lung cancer with low-frequency mutations. The eTMB in tumors harboring POLE mutations and microsatellite instability was not overestimated, suggesting that panel sequencing could accurately estimate TMB in  tumors with high-frequency mutations such as hypermutator tumors. These results may provide helpful information for interpreting TMB results based on clinical sequencing using a targeted gene panel."

Flow cytometric  analysis revealed changes in percentage of various immune cell types, including CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, myeloid-derived suppressor cell, regulatory T cell and  PD-1 expressing T cell after atezolizumab. Levels of plasma tumor marker CEA, CA125 and CA199 were also altered after anti-PD-L1 therapy. In comparison with baseline, the disease progressed patients showed sharp increase in tumor marker levels, while those disease controlled patients were seen with decreased regulatory T cell and myeloid-derived suppressor cell ratios. The circulating immune cell ratios and plasma tumor marker levels were related with clinical efficacy of atezolizumab therapy. These factors could  be potential predictive marker for anti-PD-L1 therapy in advanced non-small cell  lung cancer."

Although IAP antagonists affect the intrinsic signaling  of tumor cells, their most pronounced effects are on immune cells and the generation of antitumor immunity. Here, we examined the effects of IAP antagonism on T-cell development using mouse fetal thymic organ culture and observed a selective loss of iNKT cells, an effector cell type of potential importance for cancer immunotherapy. Thymic iNKT-cell development probably failed due to increased strength of TCR signal leading to negative selection, given that mature iNKT cells treated with IAP antagonists were not depleted, but had enhanced cytokine production in both mouse and human ex vivo cultures. Consistent with this, mature mouse primary iNKT cells and iNKT hybridomas increased production of effector cytokines in the presence of IAP antagonists. In vivo administration of  IAP antagonists and α-GalCer resulted in increased IFNγ and IL-2 production from  iNKT cells and decreased tumor burden in a mouse model of melanoma lung metastasis. Human iNKT cells also proliferated and increased IFNγ production dramatically in the presence of IAP antagonists, demonstrating the utility of these compounds in adoptive therapy of iNKT cells."

Current treatment options are inadequate, reflecting a substantial unmet clinical need. Increasing knowledge regarding the mechanisms and genetic aberrations underlying  tumor development and growth has heralded a new era of therapy in oncology, moving away from indiscriminate cytotoxic chemotherapy toward more finely focused, targeted medicine. The development of small-molecule drugs and monoclonal antibodies directed toward specific components of dysfunctional molecular or immune pathways, and mutated genes specific to particular cancer types, is leading the field to more personalized and less toxic treatment options, many of which have demonstrated greater efficacy and survival benefits than their chemotherapeutic counterparts. Particularly successful examples are agents that interfere with the programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway, which many tumors can hijack to avoid immune surveillance and editing. Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed at PD-1 that blocks the engagement between PD-1 and  its ligands, has been explored as a treatment for solid tumors, and demonstrated  survival benefits in several studies. The use of PD-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab in advanced cancers is widespread, and pembrolizumab  is available in more than 60 countries for at least one of the following: advanced melanoma, PD-L1-expressing NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and adult and pediatric patients with refractory classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. This work provides a brief overview of the role of pembrolizumab in the treatment of advanced (recurrent/metastatic) NSCLC."

However, the consequence of such inhibition and its downstream effects in driving lung cancer remain unexplored. Herein, we ascertain the molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylation compromises PTEN function, contributing to lung cancer. Replacement of the serine/threonine residues with alanine generated PTEN-4A, a phosphorylation-deficient PTEN mutant, which suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation and migration. PTEN-4A preferentially localized to the nucleus where it suppressed E2F1-mediated transcription of cell cycle genes. PTEN-4A physically interacted with the transcription factor E2F1 and associated with chromatin at gene promoters with E2F1 DNA-binding sites, a likely mechanism for its transcriptional suppression function. Deletion analysis revealed that the C2  domain of PTEN was indispensable for suppression of E2F1-mediated transcription.  Further, we uncovered cancer-associated C2 domain mutant proteins that had lost their ability to suppress E2F1-mediated transcription, supporting the concept that these mutations are oncogenic in patients. Consistent with these findings, we observed increased PTEN phosphorylation and reduced nuclear PTEN levels in lung cancer patient samples establishing phosphorylation as a bona fide inactivation mechanism for PTEN in lung cancer. Thus, use of small molecule inhibitors that hinder PTEN phosphorylation is a plausible approach to activate PTEN function in the treatment of lung cancer.

However, nivolumab, an anti-PD-1  antibody, can cause serious adverse events that are mostly autoimmune related. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman was treated with nivolumab as second-line  therapy for stage IV adenocarcinoma. The patient developed a nivolumab-induced recurrent pneumonitis preceding durable clinical remission after seven cycles of  nivolumab. Although high-dose glucocorticosteroids were tapered to conform to contemporary guidelines, recurring episodes of pneumonitis occurred without nivolumab rechallenge. In addition, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels were associated with treatment response, since CEA decline correlated with a near complete radiological response and, conversely, elevated CEA serum levels were associated with progressive disease. In this case, we described recurrence of nivolumab-induced pneumonitis as a serious adverse event in immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our case  illustrates that immune-related adverse events may correlate with antitumour activity, even after treatment discontinuation. In addition, this case suggests the possible clinical utility of CEA serum levels for the assessment of (durable) effects of immunotherapy."

Preclinical studies have shown that PD-L1 expression is upregulated on tumor cells after radiotherapy, resulting in the synergistically enhanced antitumor effect of irradiation and PD-L1 blockade. In the clinical setting, patients receiving radiotherapy before anti-PD-1 treatment  have had a significantly better prognosis than those who have not undergone radiotherapy. In the present report, we reviewed previous studies of the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment for NSCLC. In addition, we report our case of a patient whose PD-L1 expression gradually increased in brain metastases from NSCLC after repeated radiotherapy.

Several evaluation criteria have been proposed, such as the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), version 1.1, immune -related RECIST (irRECIST) and iRECIST, but have not been systematically compared in a homogeneous population. We conducted a monocentric retrospective analysis of consecutive advanced NSCLC patients treated with an anti-programmed cell death-1  or anti-program death-ligand 1. Response patterns and the discordance between RECIST 1.1, irRECIST and iRECIST guidelines were described, and associations of response patterns and clinical outcome were explored. Overall, 160 patients treated between February 2013 and October 2016 were included. Atypical responses were observed in 20 patients (13%), including eight pseudoprogressions (PsPDs) (5%) and 12 dissociated responses (8%). Thirteen of the 20 patients demonstrated clinical benefit. Per the RECIST 1.1, 37 patients (23%) showed an objective response or stable disease, and 123 patients (77%) exhibited progression. Eighty progressive patients were assessable for irRECIST and iRECIST: 15 patients were assessed differently; however, only three (3.8%) mismatches with a theoretical impact on the therapeutic decision were identified. Patients with PsPD or dissociated response had higher overall survival than patients with true progression. CONCLUSION: Atypical responses (PsPD/dissociated response) occurred in 13% of NSCLC patients under immune checkpoint inhibitors. Based on survival analyses, the RECIST 1.1 evaluation underestimated the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors in 11% of the progressive patients. Immune-related RECIST and iRECIST  identified these unconventional responses, with a 3.8% discrepancy rate."

Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this study. 18F-FDG-PET/CT was carried out before and 1 month after nivolumab therapy. SUVmax, metabolic tumour  volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were calculated. Immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was conducted. Among all patients, a partial metabolic response to nivolumab was observed in 29% on SUVmax, 25% on MTV, and 33% on TLG, whereas seven (29%) patients achieved a partial response (PR) based on RECIST v1.1. The predictive probability of PR (100% vs. 29%, p = 0.021) and progressive disease (100% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.002) at 1 month after nivolumab initiation was significantly higher  in 18F-FDG on PET/CT than in CT scans.

Acting as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab binds to PD-1 expressed on the surface  of many immune cells and prevents ligation by its natural ligands. Nivolumab is only effective in a subset of patients, and there is limited evidence supporting  its use for diagnostic, monitoring, or stratification purposes. 89Zr-Df-nivolumab was synthesized to map the biodistribution of PD-1-expressing tumor infiltrating T-cells in vivo using a humanized murine model of lung cancer. The tracer was developed by radiolabeling the antibody with the positron emitter zirconium-89 (89Zr). Imaging results were validated by ex vivo biodistribution studies, and PD-1 expression was validated by immunohistochemistry. Data obtained from PET imaging were used to determine human dosimetry estimations. The tracer showed elevated binding to stimulated PD-1 expressing T-cells in vitro and in vivo. PET imaging of 89Zr-Df-nivolumab allowed for clear delineation of subcutaneous tumors through targeting of localized activated T-cells expressing PD-1 in the tumors and salivary glands of humanized A549 tumor-bearing mice. In addition to tumor uptake, salivary and lacrimal gland infiltration of T-cells was noticeably visible and confirmed via histological analysis. These data support our claim that PD-1-targeted agents allow for tumor imaging in vivo, which may assist in the design and development of new immunotherapies. In the future, noninvasive imaging of immunotherapy biomarkers may assist in disease diagnostics, disease monitoring, and patient stratification."

ALCAM (CD166), a type I transmembrane protein, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In normal cells, ALCAM regulates physiological processes such as angiogenesis and immune response. In cancer, it is associated with neoplastic progression, including invasion, migration, and metastasis. Furthermore, ALCAM is considered one of the cancer stem cell markers such as ALDH1 (ALDH1A1) and SALL4. The PD-L1 (CD274)/PD-1 (PDCD1, CD279) pathway is crucial for the modulation of immune responses in normal cells. Nevertheless, pathologic activation of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway participates in immune evasion by tumor cells. Many PD-L1-expressing tumor cells  have been identified in different types of cancer, including malignant mesothelioma. In this study, 175 well-characterized primary diffuse pleural mesotheliomas, including the epithelioid (n = 148), biphasic (n = 15), and sarcomatoid (n = 12) histotypes, were evaluated immunohistochemically for cancer  stem cell markers (ALCAM, ALDH1, and SALL4) and PD-L1 expression. Twenty-five percent of the mesotheliomas (43/175) expressed ALCAM, whereas ALDH1 and SALL4 positivity was seen in 1% to 2% of cases. Thirty-three percent of the analyzed tumors (57/175) contained PD-L1-positive cells. Overall survival was significantly decreased in the cohort of patients with ALCAM- or PD-L1-positive tumors (both P < .01). Furthermore, the multivariate Cox hazards regression analysis identified ALCAM and PD-L1 (both P < 0.01) as potential independent risk factors. Thus, a combination of these 2 markers might be useful for prognostication and planning the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma."

As blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by the monoclonal antibodies induced effective T cell-mediated antitumour response, suppression of PD-L1 expression in tumour cells by the chemical agent might contribute to treatment against malignant tumours. Nafamostat mesilate (NM), a serine protease inhibitor that is frequently used in the clinic, potently suppressed interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced up-regulation of PD-L1 in cultured human lung cancer cells (HLC-1) at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Interestingly, suppression of IFN-gamma-induced up-regulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC by NM was limited, suggesting that NM did not block CTL responses to tumour cells. NM treatment did not affect the activation status of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 or the induction of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 expression in IFN-gamma-treated HLC-1 cells. Although NM treatment promoted the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) 1/2, an Erk inhibitor, U0126, could not reverse the suppression of PD-L1 up-regulation by IFN-gamma. Suppression of IFN-gamma-induced up-regulation of PD-L1 by NM was not associated with the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) or protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 pathway. Besides HLC-1 cells, NM suppressed IFN-gamma-induced PD-L1 up-regulation in three human pancreatic cancer cell lines. NM could potentiate the antitumour effect of cancer vaccines or immune checkpoint inhibitors by preventing IFN-gamma-induced PD-L1 up-regulation and blocking immune checkpoint suppression."

We performed an integrated analysis of multidimensional data from a discovery set consisting of cohorts of The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Broad Institute data set from the LUAD public database and a validation set from the Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out to  determine the expression of the proteins programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) and CD8. Patients with solid predominant LUAD showed poor disease-free survival and a high frequency of relapse/metastasis compared with those with the nonsolid  subtype of LUAD. The solid subtype tended to occur more frequently in those with  a history of smoking. Solid predominant LUAD exclusively showed increased expression of PD-L1 and a high proportion of dual positive PD-L1- and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Meanwhile, a notable increase in the tumor mutation burden and higher frequency of GC>TA transversions were specifically identified in tumors of the solid subtype. Furthermore, the solid subtype of tumor displayed an active cytotoxic immune signature and increased incidence of genetic mutations related to immunogenicity. CONCLUSION: Solid predominant LUAD was identified as a subtype with adaptive immune resistance, higher cytotoxic activity, and enhanced immunogenicity. These  findings suggest that patients with solid predominant LUAD may represent a potential selective group that will benefit from adjuvant programmed cell death 1 blockade immunotherapy."

This study included patients with available SCAI response data. We compared the SCAI objective response rates (ORRs) with the ORRs after the last chemotherapy administered before immunotherapy (LCBI). In total, 73 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses. Of these patients, 10 received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line  therapy and the remaining 63 had available LCBI response data. Of the 73 patients treated with SCAI, 39 (53.4%) achieved the ORR, whereas the ORR of LCBI was 34.9% (22 of 63) (p = 0.03). We also compared the ORRs of the SCAI and LCBI groups after stratification into platinum doublet therapy versus nonplatinum monotherapy. The ORRs for platinum doublet SCAI and LCBI therapies were 66.7% (16 of 24) and 39.5% (17 of 43), respectively (p = 0.03), whereas for nonplatinum SCAI and LCBI monotherapies they were 46.9% (23 of 49) and 25.0% (5 of 20), respectively (p = 0.09).

However, current single-agent treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody may provide significant survival benefits only in a small subset of patients. PD-L1 expression status on tumor cells is an approved biomarker to predict response to ICIs, but is not enough for optimal patient selection. To improve the therapeutic outcomes, development of novel biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status is essential. Combination treatment strategies based on blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 may also be promising, and a variety of combinations, such as ICIs plus chemotherapy, are being examined in ongoing clinical trials. Here we review and discuss the current status and future perspectives of immunotherapy with ICIs."

Whilst pre-clinical studies suggest EGFR-driven NSCLC inhibit antitumor immunity through the activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, epidemiology studies suggest EGFR mutant NSCLC are more likely to have decreased  PD-L1 expression. The superiority of single agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors over docetaxel in pre-treated EGFR mutant NSCLC appears to be moderated. Several mechanisms for a poor response to immune checkpoint have been proposed including  a lower tumor mutation burden, and an uninflamed and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Predictive biomarkers to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors sensitivity in patients with EGFR mutations are required. The role of EGFR TKI in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is currently being investigated intensively in multiple clinical trials and outcomes from these trials are immature and the optimal sequence, schedule and dosing remains to be determined. A careful evaluation will be required in view of the increased toxicities reported in some  of the early studies of combination therapy."

Active immunotherapies encompassing immune checkpoint inhibitors are the most widespread class of immunotherapies, with indications for melanoma, non-small lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated unique response patterns that are not adequately captured by traditional response criteria such das the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and World Health Organization criteria. Consequently, adaptions of these criteria have been released such as the immune-related RECIST and immune RECIST, which account for the specialities of immunotherapies. Immunotherapies can cause a distinct set of adverse events such as pneumonitis, colitis, and hypophysitis.  In addition, atypical treatment response patterns termed pseudoprogression have been observed. Thereby, new or enlarging lesions appear after treatment start and mimic tumor progression, which is followed by an eventual decrease in total tumor burden. In this review article we will describe pitfalls in the radiological response assessment of immunotherapies, focusing on pseudoprogression and imaging appearances of common immune-related adverse events."

This includes the comparability of antibody clones, prognostic value, and discrepancies between primary tumors and metastases. We assessed tumoral PD-L1 expression using clones  E1L3N and SP142 in 372 primary resected pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas, including 40 paired N2 lymph node metastases, in relation with clinico-pathological parameters. PD-L1 expression was negative (<1%) in 163/372 (44%, E1L3N) or 231/370 patients (62%, SP142). Positivity of 1-<50% was observed  in 135 (36%, E1L3N) or 92 patients (25%, SP142) and ≥50% in 74 (20%, E1L3N) or 47 patients (13%, SP142). PD-L1 staining correlated significantly between both antibodies (r=0.781; P<0.001). Scores correlated significantly between full-slide sections (N=40) and tissue microarrays, and between primaries and N2 metastases (P<0.001 all). CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte counts positively correlated with PD-L1 expression (P<0.001). PD-L1 ≥50% showed the best prognostic discrimination using the split-sample validation method. It was associated with shorter disease-specific survival in the observation group (E1L3N: P=0.035, SP142: P=0.002) and validation group (E1L3N: P=0.024, SP142: P=0.101) and shorter time to recurrence (observation group: E1L3N: P=0.056, SP142: P<0.001; validation group: E1L3N: P=0.036, SP142: P=0.247). Multivariate analysis showed that PD-L1 expression ≥50% determined by clone E1L3N was an independent prognostic factor in the observation group regarding disease-specific survival (HR=2.768; 95% CI=1.149-6.666; P=0.023) and time to recurrence (HR=2.164; 95% CI=1.056-4.436; P=0.035) and in the validation group (disease-specific survival: HR=1.978; 95% CI=0.928-4.214; P=0.077 and time to recurrence: HR=1.571; 95% CI=0.838-2.944; P=0.159). High PD-L1 expression was associated with adverse prognosis in pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. Clone E1L3N was more sensitive than SP142 and  superior regarding prognostication. PD-L1 expression correlated significantly between primary tumor and N2 metastases, rendering mediastinal lymph node metastases adequate for immunohistochemical assessment."

A total of 75  patients with lung cancer were enrolled in the present study. The percentage of infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was determined by flow cytometry. ELISA was performed to evaluate the concentration of PGE2 in lung cancer tissue homogenate. The correlation between PGE2 and PD-1 expression levels in CD8+ T cells was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation test. The expression levels of PD-1 and PGE2 receptors were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The level of PD-1 expression in infiltrating CD8+ T cells was gradually increased as the stage of lung cancer  increased. The level of PD-1 expression was also positively associated with the concentration of PGE2 in lung cancer tissues. Furthermore, the level of PD-1 expression was closely associated with the PGE2/EP2 and PGE2/EP4 signaling pathways. The activation of PGE2-associated EP2- and EP4-pathways may positively  regulate the level of PD-1 in infiltrating CD8+ T cells, which results in immune  tolerance in the lung cancer microenvironment."

This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety between anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and docetaxel in previously treated, advanced NSCLC. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched for eligible studies. Five studies with a total of 3,025 patients were included. Our  results showed that, for all patients, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy prolonged overall  survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.63-0.75) and progression-free  survival (PFS) (HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94). For patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy had higher objective response rates. In subgroup analysis according to the tumor PD-L1 expression level, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was associated with longer OS and PFS in patients with high PD-L1 expression (≥1%, ≥5%, ≥10% and ≥50%), but not in those with low expressions. In subgroup analysis of patients' characteristics, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies showed OS benefits across most prespecified subgroups, except for patients with EGFR mutation-positive and never smokers. For patients with EGFR mutation, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was an unfavorable factor of PFS. The grade 3 or 4 adverse events rates of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment were significantly lower than that of docetaxel.

For patients with localised NSCLC (stages I to III), it has been speculated that immunotherapy may be helpful for reducing postoperative recurrence rates, or improving the clinical outcomes of current treatment for unresectable tumours. While several new agents have now  entered phase III clinical trials, we felt a systematic review was needed to address the question of the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy in patients with stages I to III NSCLC. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of immunotherapy (excluding  checkpoint inhibitors) in patients with localised NSCLC (stages I to III) who received surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent. SEARCH We searched the following databases (from inception to 20 January 2017): CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL, and five trial registers. We also manually checked abstracts or reports from relevant conference proceedings and the reference lists of included trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults (≥ 18 years) with histologically-confirmed early-stage (stages I to III) NSCLC after surgical resection, and those with unresectable locally advanced stage III  NSCLC who had received radiotherapy with curative intent. For patients who had received primary surgical treatment, postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy was allowed if it was used for both experimental and control groups. Two review authors independently selected eligible  trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used survival analysis to pool time-to-event data, expressing the intervention effect as a hazard ratio (HR). We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data, and mean differences for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to clinical heterogeneity (immunotherapeutic agents with different underlying mechanisms), we used random-effects models for our meta-analyses. MAIN We identified nine eligible trials that randomised 4940 participants, who had received surgical resection or curative radiotherapy, to either an immunotherapy group or a control group. Included immunological interventions were active immunotherapy (i.e. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)), adoptive cell transfer (i.e. transfer factor (TF), tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), dendritic cell-cytokine induced killer (DC-CIK), and antigen-specific cancer vaccines (melanoma-associated antigen 3 (MAGE-A3) and L-BLP25). Except for one small trial, which provided insufficient information for risk assessment, we assessed five studies at high risk of bias for at least one of the seven biases studied; we considered the risk of bias in the other three trials to be low. We included data from seven of the nine trials in the meta-analyses (4695 participants). We pooled data from 3693 participants from the three high quality RCTs to evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). We found a small, but not statistically significant, improvement  in OS (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.06; P = 0.35), and PFS (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to  1.07; P = 0.19; high-quality evidence). The addition of immunotherapy resulted in a small, but not statistically significant, increased risk of having any adverse  event (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.37; P = 0.11, three trials, 3955 evaluated participants, moderate-quality evidence), or severe adverse events (RR 1.10, 95%  CI 0.88 to 1.39; four trials, 4362 evaluated participants; low-quality evidence).We analysed data from six studies for one-, two-, and three-year survival rates (4265 participants), and from six studies for five-year survival rates (4234 participants). We observed no clear between-group differences (low-quality evidence for one- and two-year survival rates, and moderate-quality  evidence for three- and five-year survival rate).No trial reported the overall response rates; only one trial provided health-related quality of life results. AUTHORS' The current literature does not provide evidence that suggests a survival benefit from adding immunotherapy (excluding checkpoint inhibitors) to conventional curative surgery or radiotherapy, for patients with localised NSCLC (stages I to III). The addition of vaccine-based immunotherapy might increase the risk of adverse events. Several ongoing trials with immune checkpoints inhibitors (PD-1/PD-L1) might bring new insights for role of immunotherapy for patients with stages I to III NSCLC."

In studying the development of lung metastases, we found that NK cells lose their cytotoxic capacity and acquire a molecular signature defined by  the expression of coinhibitory receptors. In an effort to overcome this suppressive mechanism, we evaluated NK cell responses to the immunostimulatory cytokine IL12. Exposure to IL12 rescued the cytotoxicity of NK cells but also led to the emergence of an immature NK cell population that expressed high levels of  the coinhibitory molecules PD-1, Lag-3, and TIGIT, thereby limiting NK cell-mediated control of pulmonary metastases. Notably, checkpoint blockade therapy synergized with IL12 to fully enable tumor control by NK cells, demonstrating that checkpoint blockers are not only applicable to enhance T cell-mediated immunotherapy, but also to restore the tumor-suppressive capacity of NK cells."

Patients received neoadjuvant therapy consisting of 3 cycles of paclitaxel with either cisplatin or carboplatin and ipilimumab included in the last 2 cycles.Results: Chemotherapy alone had little effect on immune parameters in PBMCs. Profound CD28-dependent activation of both CD4 and CD8 cells was observed  following ipilimumab. Significant increases in the frequencies of CD4+ cells expressing activation markers ICOS, HLA-DR, CTLA-4, and PD-1 were apparent. Likewise, increased frequencies of CD8+ cells expressing the same activation markers, with the exception of PD-1, were observed. We also examined 7 resected tumors and found higher frequencies of activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes than those observed in PBMCs. Surprisingly, we found 4 cases of preexisting tumor-associated antigens (TAA) responses against survivin, PRAME, or MAGE-A3 present in PBMC at baseline, but neither increased frequencies nor the appearance of newly detectable responses following ipilimumab therapy. Ipilimumab had little effect on the frequencies of circulating regulatory T cells and MDSCs.This study did not meet the primary endpoint of detecting an increase in blood-based TAA T-cell responses after ipilimumab. Collectively, these results highlight the immune activating properties of ipilimumab in early-stage NSCLC. The immune profiling data for ipilimumab alone can contribute  to the interpretation of immunologic data from combined immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapies."

We utilized TCGA samples to comprehensively immunophenotype lung tumors and analyze the links between DNA repair mutations, neo-antigen and total mutational burden, and tumor immune infiltration. Overall, 73% of lung tumors contained infiltration by at least one  T cell subset, with high mutational burden tumors containing significantly increased infiltration by activated CD4 and CD8 T cells. Further, mutations in mismatch repair genes, homologous recombination genes, or POLE accurately predicted increased tumor mutational burden, neo-antigen load, and T cell infiltration. Finally, neo-antigen load correlated with expression of M1-polarized macrophage genes, PD-1, PD-L1, IFNγ, GZMB, and FASLG, among other immune-related genes.

Among patients with initial benefit, factors associated with subsequent progression-free survival included higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (p = 0.004) and lower depth of response to anti-PD-1 therapy (p = 0.003). A T cell-inflamed microenvironment was identified in 42% of TCGA adenocarcinoma samples versus 21.0% of squamous cell. Discussion: Specific clinical characteristics appear to be predictive of either innate or acquired resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. A T cell-inflamed tumor was more common in adenocarcinoma than squamous histology. Methods: A retrospective review of NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy. Patients with innate resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (defined  as progression at first CT evaluation) were compared to patients with initial clinical benefit. Among those with initial clinical benefit, we identified prognostic factors for time to progression (acquired resistance) or death. To further corroborate our findings on limited numbers, immune gene expression profiling of all NSCLC samples from the TCGA database was also pursued."

Many clinical trials involving these drugs achieved breakthroughs in patients previously treated for advanced NSCLC. However, the results of these clinical studies are not consistent. In this report, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies compared with docetaxel treatment for advanced NSCLC patients from 5 randomized clinical trials. We demonstrated that the patients in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy groups had significantly longer overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.63-0.75, P < 0.05) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.92, P < 0.05) than those in chemotherapy groups, especially PD-L1 positive patients. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies improved the objective response rate (ORR) compared with docetaxel (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.19-2.26, p < 0.05). In addition, the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy had fewer treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.28-0.39, P < 0.05) than docetaxel, especially the grade ≥3 AEs (OR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.12-0.28, P < 0.001). In conclusion, our study revealed that, compared with docetaxel, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy improved clinical efficacy and safety in previously treated advanced NSCLC patients. This therapy may be a promising treatment for advanced NSCLC patients."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, namely anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), antiprogrammed cell death-1 (PD-1), and antiprogrammed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies, have been used for treatment of various cancers. Classified as immune-related adverse events, several endocrinopathies, including  hypophysitis, are associated with these agents. Although anti-CTLA-4-induced hypophysitis has been frequently observed, hypophysitis upon use of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies is rare. Case 1 is a 65-year-old man presented with a stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody) following several inefficacious chemotherapies. After 56 weeks of the treatment, he complained of general malaise and appetite loss, and was diagnosed  with adrenal insufficiency. Endocrinological examination revealed isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency; pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed anterior pituitary atrophy. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy rapidly improved his symptoms and enabled him to continue atezolizumab therapy. Case 2 is a 70-year-old man with a stage IV NSCLC treated with atezolizumab. After 52 weeks of treatment, he was diagnosed with isolated ACTH deficiency. Pituitary MRI revealed no obvious abnormalities in the anterior pituitary. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy was also efficacious. We report two cases of atezolizumab-induced hypophysitis. Both showed isolated ACTH deficiency, suggesting similar clinical characteristics of hypophysitis associated with the use of anti-PD-1 antibodies. These results suggest a caution for the late-onset central adrenal insufficiency associated with hypophysitis in patients treated with anti-PD-L1 antibodies."

We used a Kras(G12D)-driven mouse model of lung cancer to establish an immune signature and identified a contribution of Gr1+ neutrophils to disease progression. Depletion experiments showed that Gr1+ cells  (1) favor tumor growth, (2) reduce T cell homing and prevent successful anti-PD1  immunotherapy, and (3) alter angiogenesis, leading to hypoxia and sustained Snail expression in lung cancer cells. In turn, Snail accelerated disease progression and increased intratumoral Cxcl2 secretion and neutrophil infiltration. Cxcl2 was produced mainly by neutrophils themselves in response to a factor secreted by Snail-expressing tumor cells. We therefore propose a vicious cycle encompassing neutrophils and Snail to maintain a deleterious tumor microenvironment."

Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a main effector of the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway, which plays important roles in cancer development. Here we show that YAP regulates PD-L1 expression in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. First, we investigated YAP and PD-L1 expression at the protein level in 142 NSCLC samples and 15 normal lung samples. In tumor tissue, immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for YAP and PD-L1, which correlated significantly (n = 142, r = 0.514, P < 0.001). Second, in cell lines that express high levels of PD-L1 (H460, SKLU-1, and H1299), the ratio of p-YAP/YAP was lower  and GTIIC reporter activity of the Hippo pathway was higher than those in three cell lines expressing low levels of PD-L1 (A549, H2030, and PC9) (P < 0.05). Third, in the same three cell lines, inhibition of YAP by two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) decreased the mRNA and protein level of PD-L1 (P < 0.05). Fourth, forced overexpression of the YAP gene rescued the PD-L1 mRNA and protein level after siRNA knockdown targeting 3'UTR of the endogenous YAP gene. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using a YAP-specific monoclonal antibody resulted in the precipitation of PD-L1 enhancer region encompassing two  putative TEAD binding sites. Our results indicate that YAP regulates the transcription of PD-L1 in NSCLC."

Here we identify that Ly6GmiLy6CloCD11b+CXCR2+ subpopulation (named CXCR2+ MDSCs) are predominately expanded and recruited in systemic and local tumor microenvironment during breast cancer progression and metastasis. The proportion of CXCR2+ MDSCs is inversely correlated with the infiltration of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Besides, CXCR2+ MDSCs promote breast cancer growth and metastasis to lung and/or lymph node in vivo. Furthermore, CXCR2+ MDSCs induce epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cells via IL-6. Moreover, CXCR2+ MDSCs upregulate the expression of immunosuppressive molecules programmed cell death protein 1(PD1), PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1), lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG3), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), and T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain protein 3 (TIM3) on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, and induce exhaustion of the activated T cells partially via IFN-γ. These  results demonstrate that CXCR2+ MDSCs accelerate breast cancer progression via directly inducing cancer cell EMT and indirectly promoting T cell exhaustion, suggesting that CXCR2+ MDSCs may be a potential therapeutic target of breast cancer."

However, immune checkpoint inhibition is successful only in subpopulations of patients emphasizing the need for powerful biomarkers that adequately reflect the complex  interaction between the tumor and the immune system. Recently, recurrent copy number gains (CNG) in chromosome 9p involving PD-L1 were detected in many cancer  types including lung cancer, melanoma, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, cervical cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer. Here, we applied functional genomics to analyze global mRNA expression changes associated with chromosome 9p gains. Using the TCGA data set, we identified a list of 75 genes that were strongly up-regulated in tumors with chromosome 9p gains across many cancer types. As expected, the gene set was enriched for chromosome 9p and in particular chromosome 9p24 (36 genes and 23 genes). Furthermore, we found enrichment of two expression programs derived from genes within and beyond 9p: one implicated in cell cycle regulation (22 genes) and the other implicated in modulation of the immune system (16 genes). Among these were specific cytokines and chemokines, e.g. CCL4, CCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, other immunoregulatory genes such as IFN-G and IDO1 as well as highly expressed proliferation-related kinases  and genes including PLK1, TTK, MELK and CDC20 that represent potential drug targets.

Recent reports indicate that inactivating mutations in the histone methyltransferase NSD1 define an intrinsic subtype of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) that features pronounced DNA hypomethylation. Here, we describe a similar hypomethylated subtype of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) that is enriched for both inactivating mutations and deletions in NSD1. The 'NSD1 subtypes' of HNSC and LUSC are highly correlated at the DNA methylation and gene expression levels, featuring ectopic expression of developmental transcription factors and genes that are also hypomethylated in  Sotos syndrome, a congenital disorder caused by germline NSD1 mutations. Further, the NSD1 subtype of HNSC displays an 'immune cold' phenotype characterized by low infiltration of tumor-associated leukocytes, particularly macrophages and CD8+ T  cells, as well as low expression of genes encoding the immunotherapy target PD-1  immune checkpoint receptor and its ligands. Using an in vivo model, we demonstrate that NSD1 inactivation results in reduced T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, implicating NSD1 as a tumor cell-intrinsic driver of  an immune cold phenotype. NSD1 inactivation therefore causes epigenetic deregulation across cancer sites, and has implications for immunotherapy."

Additionally, we evaluated the association of PD-L1 expression detected by different assays with clinicopathological features and prognosis. In total, 105 (77.78%) of 135 samples evaluated by the 22C3-IHC platform produced the same results with the SP142-IHC platform (Kappa value: 0.481, p < 0.001). In addition, 69 (51.11%) of 135 samples evaluated by the SP142-IHC platform produced the same results with the 22C3-IHC platform (Kappa value: 0.324, p < 0.001). PD-L1 expression based on the 22C3-IHC assay was significantly correlated with smoking status, whereas that based on the SP142-IHC assay was correlated with smoking status, sex, and histology. Compared to the SP142-IHC assay, the 22C3-IHC assay usually resulted in an underestimation of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and immune cells. Thus, the results from the two  assays cannot be interchanged.

PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and immune cells was analysed. Eighty-nine cases of resected NSCLC were included. Squamous cell carcinoma was more common than adenocarcinoma. IC were present in almost all cases. Immunopositivity for PD-L1 in TC and IC was 27% and 18% respectively. PD-L1 immunopositivity in TC or IC did not correlate with age, sex, stage or mutation status however sarcomatoid carcinoma and solid predominant adenocarcinomas showed higher positivity rates. PD-L1 immunopositivity in ICs was found to correlate with better disease free survival. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 immunopositivity was seen in a quarter of NSCLC patients in India. PDL1 positivity on immune cells may be associated with better prognosis in resected NSCLC. However the prognostic value of PD-L1 and clinical response to check point inhibitors in Indian population need to be validated in larger studies."

While translational and early clinical studies have demonstrated activation of antitumor immunity, most recent late-phase clinical trials have not confirmed the early promise in PDAC except in MSI-High PDAC patients. These results may in part be explained by multiple factors, including the poorly immunogenic nature of PDAC along with immune privilege, the complex tumor microenvironment, and the genetic plasticity of PDAC cells. These challenges have led to disappointments in the field, nonetheless they have also advanced our understanding that may tailor the future steps for immunotherapy for PDAC.

Various PD-L1 antibodies and cut-offs have been used in different trials to predict response to these drugs, thus comparison of those studies is difficult. We compared PD-L1 mRNA expression  measured by RT-qPCR with PD-L1 protein expression evaluated by IHC. Moreover, we  investigated the impact of different tumour tissue acquisition methods on the reliability of PD-L1 measurement techniques. NSCLC cases (N=22), including n=9 mediastinal lymph node biopsies acquired by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and n=5 metastases, were evaluated prospectively for PD-L1 protein on tumor cells (TC) and immune cells (IC) using E1L3N and 28-8 antibodies and PD-L1 mRNA using the CheckPoint TYPER® assay. In primary NSCLC tissues, agreement between PD-L1 mRNA and TC staining using the 28-8 antibody was excellent (ĸ=0.85, p=0.0002). Comparing both PD-L1 antibodies against each other showed a kappa value of 0.58 (p=0.0106). In EBUS-TBNA, PD-L1 mRNA correlated perfectly with the 28-8 antibody (ĸ=1.0, p=0.0023). PD-L1 mRNA levels significantly differed when comparing 28-8 TC staining of tumours >49% with 1-49% and 0% (p=0.0040; p=0.0081, respectively). In metastatic lesions, differences between PD-L1 mRNA and IHC became apparent (ĸ=0.2, p=0.2525). CONCLUSION: Testing of PD-L1 mRNA and 28-8 IHC showed an excellent agreement in NSCLC samples including mediastinal lymph node biopsies. Since PD-L1 expression in >50% TC detected by 28-8 IHC can be reliably detected by RT-qPCR, quantitative PD-L1 mRNA determination should be considered as an alternative to IHC as there is no interobserver variability in RNA results."

The emerging concept of conventional cancer therapies combined with immunotherapy differs from the classical concept in that it is not simply taking advantage of their additive anti-tumor effects, but it is to use certain therapeutic regimens to condition the tumor microenvironment for optimal response to immunotherapy. To this end, low dose immunogenic chemotherapies, epigenetic modulators and inhibitors of cell cycle progression are potential candidates for rendering tumors highly responsive to immunotherapy. Next generation immunotherapeutics are therefore predicted to be highly effective against cancer, when they are used following appropriate immune modulatory compounds or targeted delivery of tumor cell cycle inhibitors using nanotechnology."

Current therapeutic options only marginally improve survival. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a dominant mediator of immunosuppression, binding to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). PD-L1 is up-regulated in cancer cells, and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion, thus providing  a target for antitumor therapy. Further, a correlation between PD-L1 expression and prognosis has been reported. Studies performed on histological material have  revealed expression of PD-L1 in MM, but no study has been performed on MM effusions thus far. PD-L1 expression was determined by a commercially available antibody (clone 28-8) in 74 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell blocks from body effusions obtained at diagnosis from patients with MM. The presence of MM cells was confirmed with CK5/6, calretinin, and EMA and the admixture of macrophages was assessed with CD68. Only cases containing more than 100 tumor cells were assessed. Membranous staining in tumor cells was considered positive. Survival time was calculated from the appearance of the first malignant effusion until death. Reactivity was observed in 23 of 61 (38%) of cases and was classified as ≥1%-5% (n = 9 cases), >5%-10% (n = 4 cases), >10%-50% (n = 4 cases), and >50% (n  = 6 cases) positive cells. Survival times did not differ significantly between patients with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors.

We leveraged a collection of 14 ICI-resistant lung cancer samples to investigate whether alterations in genes encoding HLA Class I antigen  processing and presentation machinery (APM) components or interferon signaling play a role in acquired resistance to PD-1 or PD-L1 antagonistic antibodies. Recurrent mutations or copy-number changes were not detected in our cohort. In one case, we found acquired homozygous loss of B2M that caused lack of cell-surface HLA Class I expression in the tumor and a matched patient-derived xenograft (PDX). Downregulation of B2M was also found in two additional PDXs established from ICI-resistant tumors. CRISPR-mediated knockout of B2m in an immunocompetent lung cancer mouse model conferred resistance to PD-1 blockade in  vivo, proving its role in resistance to ICIs. These results indicate that HLA Class I APM disruption can mediate escape from ICIs in lung cancer.Significance:  As programmed death 1 axis inhibitors are becoming more established in standard treatment algorithms for diverse malignancies, acquired resistance to these therapies is increasingly being encountered. Here, we found that defective antigen processing and presentation can serve as a mechanism of such resistance in lung cancer."

The aim of this study was to characterize peripheral blood T cells expressing several selected surface antigens (CD4, CD8,  CD25, CD28, PD-1, CTLA-4) and transcription factors (T-bet, ROR-yt, Fox-P3, GATA-3) in this patient population. The study group (LC) consisted of 80 treatment-naïve patients with T1/2aN0M0 NSCLC and was compared with 40 cancer-free patients matched for non-oncological diseases and demographic parameters (CG). Significantly higher counts of CTLA-4+cells (in both CD4+and CD8+subtypes), a lower proportion of PD-1 expressing cells and a significantly higher percentage of Fox-P3+CD4+cells were found in the LC group. The high proportion of CD4+PD-1+cells significantly correlated with poor outcomes in LC group, while low CD4/CD8 ratio predicted a better prognosis.

Between these two sessions, a lecture entitled HLA-antigens modulation and response to immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy was also presented. Despite the impressive successes in cancer immunotherapy in recent years, the response to immune based interventions occurs only in a minority of patients (∼20%). Several basic and translational mechanisms of resistance to immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) were  discussed during the meeting: 1. the impact of tumor microenvironment on the activity of immune system; 2. strategies to inhibit the cross-talk between extracellular matrix and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the preclinical setting; 3. microRNA expression as a biomarker and as a target of therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); 4. the significance of complement  activation pathways in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors; 5. the immunosuppressive activity of the microbiota by inducing IL-17 producing cells; and 6. modulation of HLA antigens as possible markers of response to ICB therapy. In order to overcome the deficiency in active anti-tumor T cells, several clinically applicable combination strategies were also discussed: 1. strategies to enhance the anticancer effects of immunogenic cell death inducing-chemotherapy; 2. the use of CAR T-cells in solid tumors; 3. the use of combination strategies involving oncolytic viruses and ICBs; 4. combinations of new ICBs with anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy; and 4. combinations of targeted therapies and ICBs in melanoma.

Research in immunotherapy has led to important advances in the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and other malignancies using checkpoint inhibition. Multiple systemic immunotherapies have been approved or are currently being investigated for the management of urothelial malignancies (1). Five antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1--programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-1--PD-L1) pathway have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of various malignancies: pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab. Recent publications illustrate  that in specific stages, immunotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy with a better toxicity profile (1). Currently, the only FDA-approved indication for the  anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab (MEDI-4736) is locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has progressed during or following platinum-based chemotherapy within 12 months of treatment. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of durvalumab leading to its approval for urothelial carcinoma."

Epub 2017 Aug 16.","Clinical characteristics of patient selection and imaging predictors of outcome in solid tumors treated with checkpoint-inhibitors.","The rapidly evolving knowledge on tumor immunology and the continuous implementation of immunotherapy in cancer have recently led to the FDA and EMA approval of several checkpoint inhibitors as immunotherapic agents in clinical practice. Anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PDL-1 antibodies are becoming standard of care in advanced melanoma, as well as in relapsed or metastatic lung and kidney cancer, demonstrating higher and longer response compared to standard chemotherapy. These encouraging results have fostered the evaluation of these antibodies either alone or in combination with other therapies in several dozen clinical trials for the treatment of multiple tumor types. However, not all patients respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, hence, specific biomarkers are  necessary to guide and monitor therapy. The utility of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker has varied in different clinical trials, but, to date, no consensus has been reached on whether PD-L1 expression is an ideal marker for response and patient selection; approximately 20-25% of patients will respond to immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors despite a negative PD-L1 staining. On the other hand,  major issues concern the evaluation of objective response in patients treated with immunotherapy. Pure morphological criteria as commonly used in solid tumors  (i.e. RECIST) are not sufficient because change in size is not an early and reliable marker of tumor response to biological therapies. Thus, the scientific community has required a continuous adaptation of immune-related response criteria (irRC) to overcome the problem. In this context, metabolic information and antibody-based imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) have been investigated, providing a powerful approach for an optimal stratification of patients at staging and during the evaluation of the response to therapy. In the  present review we provide an overview on the clinical characteristics of patient  selection when using imaging predictors of outcome in solid tumors treated with checkpoint-inhibitors."

While many studies have been published on this biomarker, they raise a  number of questions concerning mainly, (i) the type of antibody for use and its condition of utilization, (ii) the threshold to be used, (iii) the message and information to communicate to the thoracic oncologist and, (iv) the adoption of this methodology as part of the daily practices of a pathology laboratory. Areas  covered: This review provides an update on the use of the different PD-L1 antibodies for IHC in the context of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and discusses their use as companion or complementary diagnostic tests. The limits of PD-L1 IHC as a predictive test, the precautions to be adopted as well as some perspectives will then be considered. Expert commentary: IHC for PD-L1 can be considered as a theranostic test, which implies providing an extremely reliable result that avoids any false positive and negative results. PD-L1 IHC requires considerable expertise and specific training of pathologists.  PD-L1 IHC can be a companion or complementary diagnostic test depending on the clone employed, the molecular therapy prescribed and the indication of use."

There are 2 major subtypes of lung cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Studies show that NSCLC is the more prevalent type of lung cancer  that accounts for approximately 80%-85% of cases. Although, various treatment methods, such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy have been used to treat lung cancer patients, there is an emergent need to develop more effective approaches to deal with advanced stages of tumors. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a new approach to combat with such tumors. The development and success of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/program death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blockades in treating metastatic cancers opens a new pavement for the future research. The current mini review discusses the significance of immune checkpoint inhibitors in promoting the death of tumor cells. Additionally, this review also addresses the importance of tumor-specific antigens (neoantigens) in the development of cancer vaccines and major challenges associated with this therapy. Immunotherapy can be a promising approach to treat NSCLC because it stimulates host's own immune system to recognize cancer cells. Therefore, future research should focus on the development of new methodologies to identify novel checkpoint inhibitors and potential neoantigens."

Four years after surgical resection, she was diagnosed with recurrent disease and was eventually treated with nivolumab as third-line therapy. One month after the completion of nivolumab therapy, the patient reported abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea. We diagnosed immune-related colitis and started oral prednisolone. However, the steroid therapy was ineffective, so the patient was administered infliximab and an increased dose of prednisolone. Her symptoms subsequently resolved, and her mucosal lesions improved. Six months after the last administration of nivolumab,  osimertinib was initiated as fourth-line therapy, but 3 days later, the patient developed blood in the stool and frequent diarrhea. Osimertinib treatment was discontinued, given the possibility that it had reactivated the patient's immune-related colitis. We subsequently re-administered oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day), and the colitis resolved within a few weeks."

Methods Patients with SCLC received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 24 months or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. PD-L1-positive patients had membranous PD-L1 expression in ≥ 1% of tumor and associated inflammatory cells or positive staining in stroma. Response was assessed by investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 every 8 weeks for the first 6 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. Adverse events (AEs) were reported per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Primary end points were safety, tolerability, and objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included progression-free survival, overall survival, and duration of response. Results Twenty-four patients with PD-L1-expressing SCLC were enrolled and received at least one pembrolizumab dose. At the data cutoff date (June 20, 2016), the median follow-up duration was 9.8 months (range, 0.5 to 24 months). All 24 patients experienced AEs; the most common were asthenia (n = 7), fatigue (n = 7), and cough (n = 6). Two patients experienced grade 3 to 5 treatment-related AEs: one patient had elevated bilirubin, and one patient had asthenia, grade 5 colitis, and intestinal ischemia. One patient had a complete response, and seven patients  had partial responses, resulting in an ORR of 33% (95% CI, 16% to 55%). Conclusion The safety of pembrolizumab was consistent with the known safety profile in other tumor types. Pembrolizumab demonstrated promising antitumor activity in patients with pretreated, PD-L1-expressing SCLC."

This subclass of drugs is increasingly administered to patients with advanced melanoma. They are also commonly incorporated into other cancer therapies such as non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer, head and neck cancers and Hodgkin lymphoma. The most commonly administered immunotherapeutic agents in the treatment of melanoma include programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors and a subclass of cytokines. During treatment with these antibodies, a unique set of adverse effects may occur which are often called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). It is vital for radiologists to be aware of and document these side effects during routine staging or body imaging during  therapy. Some of these include pneumonitis, colitis, hypophysitis, lymphadenopathy or sarcoid-like syndrome and myositis. IrAEs such as sarcoid-like lymphadenopathy can mimic progression of disease. Serious side effects are seen in less than 10% of patients, and typically emerge between 6 and 12 weeks after commencing treatment. The clinical manifestations of these side effects typically vary from mild to severe and so do the radiological findings. Patients with mild  side effects are often treated successfully with systemic corticosteroids, while  severe cases require cessation of immunotherapy. We provide a pictorial article on the common irAEs and the associated radiological manifestations."

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors against such metastases using a murine model of osteosarcoma. Murine osteosarcoma LM8 cells were transplanted subcutaneously into C3H  mice. The primary tumor lesion was surgically resected 11 days after transplantation. Two hundred micrograms of three antibodies (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-OX-86) or an isotype antibody were administered intraperitoneally on post-transplantation days 11, 14, 18, and 21. Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on day 11 after tumor transplantation (pre-therapy) and on day 25 (post-therapy). For pathology, 3 mice from each group were euthanized on days 11, 22, and 33 after tumor transplantation. The antibody-treated group had a significantly longer survival time compared with the control group (p = 0.002). Both the CT scan and pathological results revealed suppression of metastatic tumor proliferation in the treatment group as compared with the control group. These results suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors may be an innovative therapy for lung metastases of advanced pediatric solid tumors."

We report the role of radiofrequency (RF) -based splenic-preserving splenectomy in a patient with a solitary splenic metastasis from advanced stage melanoma that was managed with checkpoint inhibitors. We report a case of a 60-year-old man who presented with multiple lung metastases and a solitary splenic metastasis with advanced stage melanoma following excision of primary from his trunk 2.3 years back. DIAGNOSIS: Considering the diagnosis of advanced stage melanoma with multiple lung metastases and a solitary splenic metastasis, and its ongoing progressive nature. This case was discussed in the tumour board meeting. INTERVENTIONS: A decision was made to commence treatment with immunotherapy in the form of PD-1 inhibitor (programmed cell death 1 receptor) pembrolizumab. Follow-up restaging computer tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest showed a significant reduction in the lung and chest wall lesions, but the splenic lesion remained unchanged. Given the lack of response to treatment in the splenic metastasis and the significant decrease in lung metastases, the multidisciplinary team decided that a partial splenectomy combined with continued immunotherapy treatment would be appropriate as the success of immunotherapy was imminent within the splenic preservation. The postoperative recovery was smooth and the patient was discharged from hospital on the sixth postoperative day with normal platelets and white blood cells. The histopathological analysis of the resected specimen showed a metastatic melanoma with negative margins.At 10-month follow-up after the splenic resection the patient had not experienced further tumour recurrences. LESSONS: Spleen-preserving resection for an isolated, solitary splenic metastasis of melanoma is a feasible approach as it not only preserves the ongoing efficacy  of checkpoint inhibitors by preserving the physiological T cell milieu, but the immunomodulation properties of RF can produce potentially additional therapeutic  benefit."

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed correlation between PD-L1 expression and EGFR status in clinical samples of pretreated NSCLC. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry was performed using the 28-8 anti-PD-L1 antibody for tumor cell membrane staining. H-score was adopted to evaluate both percentage and intensity. We investigated H-scores ≥1, ≥5, and ≥10 as PD-L1+ cut-offs. H-score ≥10 was defined as strong PD-L1+. Results: We investigated 96 available histologic samples in 77 pretreated patients with NSCLC. Median H-score in EGFR-mutant samples (n=65) was 3 (range, 0-150), whereas EGFR-wild-type (n=31) was 8 (range, 0-134) (p=0.0075). Using H-scores ≥1, ≥5, and ≥10 cut-offs, incidence of PD-L1+ in EGFR-mutant vs. EGFR-wild-type samples were: 85% (55/65) vs. 94% (29/31) (p=0.2159); 42% (27/65)  vs. 74% (23/31) (p=0.0027); and 22% (14/65) vs. 48% (15/31) (p=0.0074), respectively.

We aim to describe the incidence of pneumonitis and other rare but severe immune-related adverse effects (IRAEs), as well as treatment related deaths. In addition, we analyze the differences in incidence of pneumonitis between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and standard-of-care chemotherapy. Methods: PubMed was searched up to 24 March 2017 for clinical trials of PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) in treatment of NSCLC. Besides, references of relevant articles were screened. Results: Finally, 22 trials were included in our study, 14 with data of pneumonitis, 19 with other severe IRAEs or treatment related deaths and 5 with control groups. Incidence of all-grade pneumonitis was 2.9% (95% CI, 2.0-4.8%) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0-2.0%). Incidence of all-grade pneumonitis in PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor therapy (n=1,313) was significantly higher than that in chemotherapy (n=918) (OR=2.35, 95% CI, 1.32-4.20, P=0.004), but had no significance in grade 3-5 pneumonitis.

These limitations are overcome with a novel treatment approach involving repeated subcutaneous delivery of a Klebsiella-derived investigational immunotherapeutic, QBKPN. In preclinical  models of lung cancer, QBKPN administration consistently showed anti-cancer efficacy, which was dependent on Klebsiella pre-exposure, but was independent of  adaptive immunity. Rather, QBKPN induced anti-tumor innate immunity that required NK cells and NKG2D engagement. QBKPN increased NK cells and macrophages in the lungs, altered macrophage polarization, and augmented the production of cytotoxic molecules. An exploratory trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer demonstrated QBKPN was well tolerated, safe, and induced peripheral immune changes suggestive of macrophage polarization and reduction of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on leukocytes. These data demonstrate preclinical efficacy, and clinical safety and tolerability, for this cancer immunotherapy strategy that exploits innate anti-tumor immune mechanisms."

Their clinical activity has been correlated with activated T-cell recognition of neoantigens, which are tumour-specific, mutated peptides presented on the surface of cancer cells. Here we present a fitness model for tumours based on immune interactions of neoantigens that predicts response to immunotherapy. Two main factors determine neoantigen fitness: the likelihood of neoantigen presentation by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and subsequent recognition by T cells. We estimate these components using the relative MHC binding affinity of each neoantigen to its wild type and a nonlinear dependence on sequence similarity of neoantigens to known antigens. To  describe the evolution of a heterogeneous tumour, we evaluate its fitness as a weighted effect of dominant neoantigens in the subclones of the tumour. Our model predicts survival in anti-CTLA-4-treated patients with melanoma and anti-PD-1-treated patients with lung cancer. Importantly, low-fitness neoantigens identified by our method may be leveraged for developing novel immunotherapies. By using an immune fitness model to study immunotherapy, we reveal broad similarities between the evolution of tumours and rapidly evolving pathogens."

Treatment options include surgery, radio- and chemotherapy, as well as the use of immunomodulatory antibodies. Interleukin (IL)-10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine involved in tumour immune escape. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on human lung surgery tissue as well as human tumour cell line cultures, FACS analysis, real-time PCR and experimental lung cancer. Here we discovered a positive correlation between IL-10 and IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) expression in the lung with tumour diameter in patients with lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer), the most life-threatening cancer type worldwide. IL-10 and IL-10R were found induced in cells surrounding the lung tumour cells, and IL-10R was mainly expressed on the surface of Foxp-3+ T-regulatory lymphocytes infiltrating the tumour of these patients where its expression inversely correlated with programmed cell death 1. These findings were confirmed in translational studies. In a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, IL-10R was found induced under metabolic restrictions present during tumour growth, whereby IL-10 inhibited PDL1 and tumour cell apoptosis. These new findings suggest that IL-10 counteracts IFN-γ effects on PD1/PDL1 pathway, resulting in possible resistance of the tumour to anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapy."

Among the post-TKI high TPS groups, median PFS with  low post- TKI CD8 + TIL scores treated with EGFR-TKIs (6.6 months) was significantly lower than that for the other patients (14.2 months; P = 0.015). The change of PD-L1 expression was accompanied by dynamic change in  CD8 + TILs and might reflect diverse mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy.

A total of 60 healthy and 290 chemotherapy-naive patients with SCLC were recruited. Venous blood samples were collected prior to chemotherapy (baseline) and after the second cycle of chemotherapy (2nd cycle), and flow cytometry was used to analyze the level of CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD-L1 with or without CD3, CD4, CD8  or CD25. Immunocytochemical method was used to detect PD-L1 expression in SCLC cell line H446. Cells of CTLA-4+ and PD-1+ in SCLC peripheral blood were (1.56±1.24)% and (8.07±3.97)%; there is no significant difference between CD3+CTLA-4+ and CD4+CTLA-4+, (4.87±5.18)% and (3.85±2.60)%, but show lower expression than CD3+PD-1+ and CD4+PD-1+ (26.63±9.04)% and (20.79±9.41)%, respectively. However, the level of CD4+CD25+CTLA-4+ cells were remarkably higher in SCLC than that in control, (7.09±5.09)% vs (1.91±1.27)%, P<0.001 and CD8+PD-1+ cells were less in SCLC than that in control, (11.47±5.85)% vs (22.56±4.21)%, P<0.001, both of which were not associated with age, sex, smoke or disease stage. Level of CD4+CD25+CTLA-4+ cells and CD8+PD-1+ cells was dropped (5.11±2.60)% vs (6.94±4.91)% and (8.74±3.39)% vs (11.48±5.91)% after 2nd cycle compare to that at baseline (P<0.000,1). Neither the level of CD4+CD25+CTLA-4+ nor CD8+PD-1+ cells before or after treatment was related to progression-free disease or overall survival of patients. Although PD-L1 was highly expressed in H446 cell cytoplasm  and membrane, it was rarely found in peripheral blood. The data we presented here showed that CTLA-4 was highly expressed in regulatory T cells and PD-1 decreased in CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood of SCLC patients, suggesting their unique mechanisms involved in immune regulation.  CD4+CD25+CTLA-4+ level changed after treatment implies its potential role in predicting treatment efficacy. ."

Target transcripts for immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1/PD-L1 and (programmed cell death-1/its ligand and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4) have proven to be beneficial against several solid tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: Simultaneous quantification of the expression level of miR-33a and PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA4 mRNAs with NanoString technology was performed in 88 lung adenocarcinoma specimens. A cohort of 323 lung adenocarcinoma patients from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database was further analyzed, in order to test our hypothesis. Potential interference of PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA4 gene expression by miR-33a was predicted using the microRNA target prediction program RNA22. Results: High miR-33a expression was significantly associated with younger (p = 0.005), female (p = 0.04), patients with low grade (p < 0.0001), early stage (p = 0.03) tumors, and better survival. The hypothesis of the involvement of miR-33a in PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA4 mechanisms was corroborated by the finding of putative miR-33a binding sites in all three genes using the RNA22 method. We found an inverse correlation between miR-33a and PD-1 levels (p = 0.01), as well  as for PD-L1 (p = 0.01) and CTLA4 (p = 0.03) expression, and a significant better prognosis for patients with high miR-33a/low PD-1. TCGA database analysis confirmed that miR-33a high levels were associated with low PD-1 expression and with longer survival on a larger population. Our study emphasizes the notion of a potential value of miR-33a as a favorable prognostic marker through PD-1 regulation."

To overcome this limitation, we engineered CAR T cells secreting checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) targeting PD-1 (CAR.αPD1-T) and evaluated their efficacy in a human lung carcinoma xenograft mouse model.Experimental Design: To evaluate the effector function and expansion capacity of CAR.αPD1-T cells in vitro, we measured the production of IFNγ and T-cell proliferation following antigen-specific stimulation. Furthermore, the antitumor efficacy of CAR.αPD1-T cells, CAR T cells, and CAR T cells combined with anti-PD-1 antibody was determined using a xenograft mouse model. Finally, the underlying mechanism was investigated by analyzing the expansion and functional capacity of TILs.Results: Human anti-PD-1 CPIs secreted by CAR.αPD1-T cells efficiently bound to PD-1 and reversed the inhibitory effect of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction on T-cell function. PD-1 blockade by continuously secreted anti-PD-1 attenuated the inhibitory T-cell signaling and enhanced T-cell expansion and effector function both in vitro and in vivo In the xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that the  secretion of anti-PD-1 enhanced the antitumor activity of CAR T cells and prolonged overall survival.With constitutive anti-PD-1 secretion, CAR.αPD1-T cells are more functional and expandable, and more efficient at tumor  eradication than parental CAR T cells. Collectively, our study presents an important and novel strategy that enables CAR T cells to achieve better antitumor immunity, especially in the treatment of solid tumors."

The precise function of LAG3 appears to be context-dependent. In this study, we investigated  the effect of LAG3 on CD4+CD25- T cells from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We found that in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of NSCLC patients, LAG3 was significantly increased in CD4+ T cells directly ex vivo and primarily in the CD4+CD25- fraction, which was regulated by prolonged TCR stimulation and the presence of IL-27. TCR stimulation also increased CD25 expression, but not Foxp3 expression, in LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- cells Compared to LAG3-nonexpressing CD4+CD25- cells, LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- cells presented  significantly higher levels of PD1 and TIM3, two inhibitory receptors best described in exhausted CD8+ T effector cells. LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- cells also presented impaired proliferation compared with LAG3-nonexpressing CD4+CD25-  cells but could be partially rescued by inhibiting both PD1 and TIM3. Interestingly, CD8+ T cells co-incubated with LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- cells at  equal cell numbers demonstrated significantly lower proliferation than CD8+ T cells incubated alone. Co-culture with CD8+ T cell and LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25-  T cell also upregulated soluble IL-10 level in the supernatant, of which the concentration was positively correlated with the number of LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- T cells. In addition, we found that LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- T cells infiltrated the resected tumors and were present at higher frequencies of in metastases than in primary tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that LAG3-expressing CD4+CD25- T cells represent another regulatory immune cell type with potential to interfere with anti-tumor immunity."

We have identified multiple tumor-infiltrating T lymphocyte subsets in patients with lung cancer, which were independent of disease stage. Functional analysis indicated high expression of the inhibitory receptors, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), lymphocyte activated gene 3 (LAG3) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in both CD4 and CD8 subsets, compared to non-malignant controls.

Although effective in  many patients and able to induce cures in some, targeting these regulatory pathways has led to a new class of immune-related adverse events. In many respects, these immune toxicities resemble idiopathic autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and vitiligo. Understanding the pathogenesis of these immune toxicities will have implications not only for care of patients receiving checkpoint blockade but may  also provide critical insights into autoimmune disease. The gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa is arguably the most complex barrier in the body, host to a diverse commensal microflora and constantly challenged by ingested foreign proteins both  of which must be tolerated. At the same time, the GI mucosa must defend against pathogenic microorganisms while maintaining sufficient permeability to absorb nutrients. For these reasons, regulatory cells and receptors are likely to play a central role in maintaining the gut barrier and GI toxicities, such as colitis and hepatitis are indeed among the most common side effects of CTLA-4 blockade and to a lesser extent blockade of PD-1 and PD-L1. High-dose corticosteroids are  typically effective for management of both checkpoint colitis and hepatitis, although a fraction of patients will require additional immune suppression such as infliximab. Prompt recognition and treatment of these toxicities is essential  to prevent more serious complications."

The programmed cell death protein-1  (PD-1) signaling pathway inhibits immune effector responses against tumors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors that block this pathway are being increasingly used  as cancer therapy. The objective of this study was to investigate whether this pathway contributes to persistent fungal infection and to determine whether anti-PD-1 Ab treatment improves fungal clearance. Studies were performed using C57BL/6 mice infected with a moderately virulent strain of Cryptococcus neoformans (52D), which resulted in prolonged elevations in fungal burden and histopathologic evidence of chronic lung inflammation. Persistent infection was associated with increased and sustained expression of PD-1 on lung lymphocytes, including a mixed population of CD4+ T cells. In parallel, expression of the PD-1 ligands, PD-1 ligands 1 and 2, was similarly upregulated on specific subsets of resident and recruited lung dendritic cells and macrophages. Treatment of persistently infected mice for 4 wk by repetitive administration of neutralizing  anti-PD-1 Ab significantly improved pulmonary fungal clearance. Treatment was well tolerated without evidence of morbidity. Immunophenotyping revealed that anti-PD-1 Ab treatment did not alter immune effector cell numbers or myeloid cell activation. Treatment did reduce gene expression of IL-5 and IL-10 by lung leukocytes and promoted sustained upregulation of OX40 by Th1 and Th17 cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates that PD-1 signaling promotes persistent cryptococcal lung infection and identifies this pathway as a potential target for novel immune-based treatments of chronic fungal disease."

Immune checkpoint blockade has been evaluated in breast cancer, particularly in the triple-negative subtype, with promising results observed in monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in the metastatic and neoadjuvant settings. However, identification of patients who are  most likely to benefit from immune checkpoint blockade remains challenging, with  many patients not responding to treatments and a significant financial cost. The  combination of immune checkpoint blockade with conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapies or with other immunotherapies is a promising strategy to potentiate its efficacy in breast cancer although further research is required to effectively identify who will respond to these immunotherapies.

Osteosarcoma cells control the recruitment and differentiation of immune infiltrating cells and establish a local immune tolerant environment favorable to the tumor growth, drug resistance  and the occurrence of metastases. Osteosarcoma cells are able to affect the balance between M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes and so could control the T-lymphocyte responses via the PD-1/PDL-1 system.

However, RECIST does not capture the heterogeneity of response in highly active therapies. Depth of tumor  response may provide a more granular view of response. We explored the association between, depth of response (DepOR), with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with NSCLC being treated with an ALK inhibitor (ALKi) or an anti-PD-1 antibody (Ab). Methods: Experimental arms from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of an ALKi and two RCTs of an anti-PD-1 Ab were separately pooled. Patient responses were grouped into DepOR 'quartiles' by percentage of maximal tumor shrinkage (Q1 = 1%-25%, Q2 = 26%-50%, Q3 = 51%-75%, and Q4 = 76%-100%), Q0 had no shrinkage. We carried out a retrospective exploratory responder analysis to evaluate the association between DepOR and OS or PFS using hazard ratios (HR) generated by the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: In the pooled ALK analysis there were 12, 39, 70, 144, and 40 patients in quartiles 0-4, respectively. The DepOR versus PFS/OS analyses HR were: 0.19/0.94 for Q1 0.11/0.56 for Q2, 0.05/0.28 for Q3, and 0.03/0.05 for Q4. In the PD-1 trials within quartiles 0-4 there were 168, 70, 44, 45, and 28 patients, respectively. The DepOR versus PFS/OS analyses HR were 0.3/0.52 for Q1, 0.22/0.47 for Q2, 0.09/0.07 for Q3, and 0.07/0.14 for Q4. Our analysis suggests a greater DepOR is associated with longer PFS  and OS for patients receiving ALKi or anti-PD1 Ab. Overall, this suggests that DepOR may provide an additional outcome measure for clinical trials, and may allow better comparisons of treatment activity."

PD-L1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry with the antibody clone SP142 in 579 surgically resected primary lung cancer patients.

We examined the association between the frequency of PD-L1 protein expression and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in preoperative 18 F-FDG PET/CT. The cut-off values for SUVmax were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. The SUVmax was significantly higher in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with PD-L1 protein expression compared with those without PD-L1 protein expression (P < 0.0001). However, there was no correlation between SUVmax and PD-L1 protein  expression in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (P = 0.6545). Multivariate analysis revealed that smoking, the presence of pleural invasion, and high SUVmax were independent predictors of PD-L1 positivity. PD-L1-expressing NSCLC had a high glucose metabolism.

However, there is still a gap of knowledge about the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in elderly patients. Data from randomized clinical trials testing ICIs are conflicting and often lack adequate statistical power. Although two large meta-analyses suggested an absence of a significant survival benefit in patients older than 75years, expanded access programs and retrospective cohort studies of ICIs in the real-life setting, showed comparable  survival outcomes and safety profiles between older and younger patients. In this complex scenario, a further unresolved issue is the potential correlation between older age and immunotherapy primary resistance, a phenomenon probably linked to the continuous and progressive remodeling of immune functions with ageing, known  as immunosenescence. Defining the role of ICIs in elderly NSCLC patients and exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying a possible lack of benefit or even  accelerated tumor growth during immunotherapy are two major challenges for future research in this field of cancer treatment.

The concordance rate for PD-L1 classification between paired samples was 67% (95% confidence interval, 57%-77%). When treating the immunohistochemistry proportional score as a continuous variable, a significant correlation of PD-L1 expression was observed between the paired samples (Pearson  correlation coefficient, 0.61; P < .001). CONCLUSION: There are good correlations of PD-L1 expression from paired NSCLC samples. For patients whose PD-L1 status is negative, it may be valuable to obtain additional tissue samples for retesting PD-L1 expression when anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is considered."

Recent findings suggest that patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who develop resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) due to mechanisms other than acquisition of the secondary T790M mutation of EGFR are more likely to benefit from nivolumab treatment, possibly as a result of a higher level of expression of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1, than are patients who are T790M-positive. The WJOG8515L study (UMIN ID: 000021133) is a randomized phase II trial to compare nivolumab with the combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed in patients with EGFR mutation-positive nonsquamous NSCLC who have developed resistance to EGFR-TKIs due to mechanisms other than T790M. Eligible patients are those with stage IV or  recurrent EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who experience disease progression after therapy with more than 1 EGFR-TKI, including gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib; they must show no evidence of the T790M mutation on analysis of a tumor biopsy specimen obtained after progression on such EGFR-TKI therapy, or, if T790M is detected, they must again experience progression on subsequent treatment with a third-generation EGFR-TKI. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary end points include overall survival (OS), objective response rate, duration of response, safety, and OS and PFS according to PD-L1 expression  level. Recruitment started in May 2016 and is ongoing."

However, biomarker-based patient  selection remains a challenge. Our aim was to assess the heterogeneity of various immune markers between different tumor areas of surgically resected NSCLC specimens. We included 94 adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 50 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) specimens. Two distinct tumor areas of each tumor sample were selected and incorporated into tissue microarrays. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells (ICs) was assessed using clone SP142 (Ventana). PDL1 gene amplification was assessed using fluorescence in situ hybridization. CD3 and CD8 densities were quantified using digital image-based analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using kappa agreement index (KI) and intraclass correlation coefficient. Prevalence of PD-L1 expression was 16.8% in TCs and 27.8% in ICs. Eleven tumors (7.6%) showed PDL1 amplification. In ADC, KI of PD-L1 TC and IC expression between cores was 0.465 and 0.260, compared with 0.274 and 0.124 in SCC, respectively. Higher concordance was observed for PDL1 amplification (KI, 0.647 in ADC and KI, 1 in SCC). Eleven (61.1%) of 18 amplified cores showed PD-L1 staining in < 5% of TCs. Intraclass correlation coefficients for CD3 and CD8 were 0.293 and 0.186 in ADC and 0.489 and 0.610 in SCC samples, respectively. We found significant heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in both ADC and SCC samples, especially in the IC compartment. Heterogeneous expression of PD-L1 could misclassify patients for PD-1/PD-L1-directed therapies."

The utility of nivolumab as second-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer has  been proven, but predictive biomarkers influencing its efficacy remain unknown. This study involved 14 patients who were treated with nivolumab from February 1 to September 30, 2016. The early response of the level of circulating  tumour DNA (ctDNA) after starting nivolumab was evaluated to ascertain whether it could predict treatment outcome. Of the 14 patients, six were responders and eight were non-responders. DNA was analysed in both tumour tissue and plasma samples. Only somatic mutations confirmed by analysis of tumour tissue were defined as ctDNA. ctDNA was detected  more often in the serial plasma samples of patients with high tumour volume (TV)  (p = 0.02). ctDNA was detected in seven cases; basal and serial ctDNA analysis revealed that a decrease in allelic frequency (AF) of ctDNA showed high-level correspondence with a good durable response. When 2 weeks was set as a clinically significant time point, changes in representative mutations of each case, defined as one of the highest baseline AF, showed 100% concordance with the response. In patients with high TV, plasma analysis of ctDNA, as validated by  tumour tissue, suggested that a durable good response to nivolumab could be predicted within 2 weeks."

Around 80% of the patients with HL will be cured by first-line therapy. However,  the ionising radiation not only produces cytotoxicity but also induces alterations in the microenvironment, and patients often struggle with the long-term consequences of these treatments, such as cardiovascular disorders, lung diseases and secondary malignancies. Hence, it is essential to improve treatments while avoiding delayed side-effects. Immunotherapy is a promising new  treatment option for Hodgkin lymphoma, and anti- programmed death-1 (PD1) agents  have produced striking results in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. The microenvironment of Hodgkin lymphoma appears to be unique in the field of human disease: the malignant Reed-Sternberg cells only constitute 1% of the cells in the lymphoma, but they are surrounded by an extensive immune infiltrate. Reed-Sternberg cells exhibit 9p24.1/PD-L1/PD-L2 copy number alterations and genetic rearrangements associated with programmed cell death ligand 1/ ligand 2 (PD-L1/2) overexpression, together with major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) and major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II) downregulation (which may facilitate the tumour's immune evasion). Although HL may be a situation in which defective immune surveillance is restored by anti-PD1 therapy, it challenges our current explanation of how anti-PD1 agents work because MHC-I expression is required for CD8-T-cell-mediated tumour antigen recognition. Here,  we review recent attempts to understand the defects in immune recognition in HL and to design an optimal evidence-based treatment for combination with anti-PD1."

Intra-tumor heterogeneity and cancer-cell plasticity give rise to therapeutic resistance and recurrence through clonal replacement and reactivation of dormant  CSCs, respectively. WNT signaling cascades cross-talk with the FGF, Notch, Hedgehog and TGFβ/BMP signaling cascades and regulate expression of functional CSC markers, such as CD44, CD133 (PROM1), EPCAM and LGR5 (GPR49). Aberrant canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling in human malignancies, including breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovary, pancreatic, prostate and uterine cancers, leukemia and melanoma, are involved in CSC survival, bulk-tumor expansion and invasion/metastasis. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics, such as anti-FZD1/2/5/7/8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (vantictumab), anti-LGR5 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) (mAb-mc-vc-PAB-MMAE), anti-PTK7 ADC (PF-06647020),  anti-ROR1 mAb (cirmtuzumab), anti-RSPO3 mAb (rosmantuzumab), small-molecule porcupine inhibitors (ETC-159, WNT-C59 and WNT974), tankyrase inhibitors (AZ1366, G007-LK, NVP-TNKS656 and XAV939) and β-catenin inhibitors (BC2059, CWP232228, ICG-001 and PRI-724), are in clinical trials or preclinical studies for the treatment of patients with WNT-driven cancers. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics are applicable for combination therapy with BCR-ABL, EGFR, FLT3, KIT or RET inhibitors to treat a subset of tyrosine kinase-driven cancers because WNT and tyrosine kinase signaling cascades converge to β-catenin for the maintenance  and expansion of CSCs. WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics might also be applicable for combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockers, such as atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, to treat cancers with immune evasion, although the context-dependent effects of WNT  signaling on immunity should be carefully assessed. Omics monitoring, such as genome sequencing and transcriptome tests, immunohistochemical analyses on PD-L1  (CD274), PD-1 (PDCD1), ROR1 and nuclear β-catenin and organoid-based drug screening, is necessary to determine the appropriate WNT signaling-targeted therapeutics for cancer patients."

However, the Dako platform is not present in each pathology department, and  this technical limitation is a major problem for the diffusion of the PD-L1 IHC predictive test for pembrolizumab. The Italian Society of Anatomic Pathology and Cytopathology and the Italian Association of Medical Oncology in an independent, multicenter study compared the in vitro diagnostics PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test (Agilent) on the Dako Autostainer and the in vitro diagnostics Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) test on the Ventana BenchMark platform (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). Using serial sections from tissue microarrays, 100 lung adenocarcinomas were locally stained and scored in four centers with the same antibody batches. A high analytical correlation (more than 90% at the lower 95% confidence interval [CI] value) between PD-L1 expression levels obtained with the 22C3 and SP263 assays was observed. At the proposed clinically relevant cutoffs (≥50% and  ≥1%), the overall concordances between 22C3 and SP263 data were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96-1) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68-0.91), respectively. The lower agreement between data obtained with the 22C3 and SP263 clones at the cutoff of 1% or higher was mainly related to the lower (about 80%) interrater agreement at this cutoff with  each clone. These results indicate a high correlation between PD-L1 IHC expression data obtained with the Agilent PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx and the Ventana  PD-L1 (SP263) tests in NSCLC and suggest that the two assays could be utilized interchangeably as an aid to select patients for first-line and second-line treatment with pembrolizumab and potentially with other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors."

However, their related adverse events (AE) are not fully characterized. Hair repigmentation (HR) is a nondescribed effect secondary to anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1 ) therapy for treatment of lung cancer (LC), in opposition to the vitiligo reactions that develop during melanoma treatment. Objective: To describe a new adverse event occurring during anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1  therapy for LC. Design, Setting, and Participants: A case series from a descriptive observation of 14 patients with HR after anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 treatment, recruited between September and December, 2016, who were followed up to detect whether they developed cutaneous AE at the time HR was detected. The patients had all been treated in the dermatology department at Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain. Clinical observation of HR during anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy for LC, proved by comparing old pictures provided by the patients and recent pictures taken during the follow-up. Results: Fourteen patients (13 men and 1 woman; mean age, 64.9 years) receiving anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presented  hair repigmentation during follow-up. This hair repigmentation consisted in a diffuse darkening of the hair in 13 of 14 patients, or in black patches between white hairs in 1. Thirteen of 14 patients presented a good clinical response to the treatment, with at least stable disease, and only 1 had to stop the therapy after only 4 cycles of treatment owing to a life-threatening progression of the disease. We present to our knowledge the first report of hair repigmentation owing to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy for lung cancer in a series  of 14 patients. Hair repigmentation may be a good response marker in patients receiving anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy for LC."

Our aim was to examine the relationship between TMB and outcome in diverse cancers treated with  various immunotherapies. We reviewed data on 1,638 patients who had undergone comprehensive genomic profiling and had TMB assessment. Immunotherapy-treated patients (N = 151) were analyzed for response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Higher TMB was independently associated with better outcome parameters (multivariable analysis). The RR for patients with high (≥20 mutations/mb) versus low to intermediate TMB was 22/38 (58%) versus 23/113 (20%; P = 0.0001); median PFS, 12.8 months vs. 3.3 months (P  ≤ 0.0001); median OS, not reached versus 16.3 months (P = 0.0036). Results were similar when anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy was analyzed (N = 102 patients), with a  linear correlation between higher TMB and favorable outcome parameters; the median TMB for responders versus nonresponders treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy was 18.0 versus 5.0 mutations/mb (P < 0.0001). Interestingly, anti-CTLA4/anti-PD-1/PD-L1 combinations versus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy was selected as a factor independent of TMB for predicting better RR (77% vs. 21%; P  = 0.004) and PFS (P = 0.024). Higher TMB predicts favorable outcome to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade across diverse tumors. Benefit from dual checkpoint blockade did not show a similarly strong dependence on TMB."

CPI can provide  durable benefits to some cancer patients with melanoma, renal cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or a growing list of other cancers. However, CPI treatment is also associated with adverse immune-mediated reactions (IMRs) that can be life-threatening. This pharmacovigilance analysis aims to characterize IMR signals in relation to CPI treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective pharmacovigilance disproportionality analysis. DATA SOURCE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN Adverse event reports submitted to FAERS between 2011 and 2015 were analyzed. CPIs were identified by generic names, and IMRs were identified by MedDRA Preferred Terms. Empirical Bayes geometric means with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (EB05-EB95) were calculated as CPI-IMR association metrics. Signals were defined as metrics with EB05 ≥ 2.0. Overall, 1,018 IMR events were submitted for CPIs, corresponding to 76% for ipilimumab, 15% for nivolumab, and 9% for pembrolizumab. The period of data collection precluded data on the most recently approved CPI agents. IMRs consisted of 51% colitis, 16% endocrinopathies, 12% pneumonitis, 11% hepatitis, 4% infusion-related reactions, 3% nephritis, and 3% other IMRs. Colitis contributed  to 63% and 41% of IMRs for ipilimumab and nivolumab, respectively. Pneumonitis and hepatitis contributed to a majority of IMRs for pembrolizumab, for which nephritis and infusion-related reactions were not reported. Signals of IMRs were  detected for CPIs as a class (EB05 = 12.4) and individual agents: ipilimumab (EB05 = 13.2), nivolumab (EB05 = 15.0), and pembrolizumab (EB05 = 7.3). Colitis and pneumonitis had the strongest signals for CPIs (EB05 = 45.6 and EB05 = 17.6,  respectively). Colitis was the strongest signal for ipilimumab (EB05 = 54.2), and pneumonitis was the strongest signal for nivolumab (EB05 = 48.0) and pembrolizumab (EB05 = 21.8). CONCLUSION: Cancer immunotherapy with CPIs is associated with a multitude of IMRs, especially colitis and pneumonitis. Individual CPIs had variable IMR signals, and pharmacoepidemiologic studies are required to evaluate the identified signals."

However, overall objective response rates are approximately 15%-25% in all NSCLC patients  who receive anti-PD therapy. Therefore, strategies to overcome primary resistance to anti-PD immunotherapy are urgently needed. We hypothesized that the barrier to the success of anti-PD therapy in most NSCLC patients can be overcome by stimulating the lymphocyte infiltration at cancer sites through locoregional virotherapy. To this end, in this study, we determined combination effects of anti-PD immunotherapy and oncolytic adenoviral vector-mediated tumor necrosis factor-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) gene therapy (Ad/E1-TRAIL) or  adenoviral-mediated TP53 (Ad/CMV-TP53) gene therapy in syngeneic mice bearing subcutaneous tumors derived from M109 lung cancer cells. Both anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies failed to elicit obvious therapeutic effects in the M109 tumors. Intratumoral administration of Ad/E1-TRAIL or Ad/CMV-TP53 alone suppressed tumor growth in animals preexposed to an adenovector and bearing subcutaneous tumors derived from M109 cells. However, combining either anti-PD-1  or anti-PD-L1 antibody with these two adenoviral vectors elicited the strongest anticancer activity in mice with existing immunity to adenoviral vectors. Dramatically enhanced intratumoral immune response was detected in this group of  combination therapy based on infiltrations of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and macrophages in tumors. Our results demonstrate that resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in syngeneic mouse lung cancer can be overcome by locoregional virotherapy."

We performed targeted NGS on 932 clinical cases of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) using the Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot panel v2 assay. Actionable mutations were identified in 65% of the cases with available  targeted therapeutic options, including 26% of the patients with mutations in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline genes. Most notably, we discovered JAK2 p.V617F somatic mutation, a hallmark of myeloproliferative neoplasms, in 1% (9/932) of the NSCLCs. Analysis of cancer cell line pharmacogenomic data showed that a high level of JAK2 expression in a panel of NSCLC cell lines is correlated with increased sensitivity to a selective JAK2 inhibitor. Further analysis of TCGA genomic data revealed JAK2 gain or loss due to genetic alterations in NSCLC clinical samples are associated with significantly elevated or reduced PD-L1 expression, suggesting that the activating JAK2 p.V617F mutation could confer sensitivity to both JAK inhibitors  and anti-PD1 immunotherapy. We also detected JAK3 germline activating mutations in 6.7% (62/932) of the patients who may benefit from anti-PD1 treatment, in light of recent findings that JAK3 mutations upregulate PD-L1 expression. CONCLUSION: Taken together, this study demonstrated the clinical utility of targeted NGS with a focused hotspot cancer gene panel in NSCLCs and identified activating mutations in JAK2 and JAK3 with clinical implications inferred through integrative analysis of cancer genetic, genomic, and pharmacogenomic data. The potential of JAK2 and JAK3 mutations as response markers for the targeted therapy against JAK kinases or anti-PD1 immunotherapy warrants further investigation."

The efficacy of antibodies targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 has led to a paradigm shift in lung cancer treatment but the prognostic and predictive value of tumor PD-L1 expression remains controversial. Evaluating PD-1, PD-L1/2 expression in peripheral blood cells may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and response to therapy. In this prospective observational study, plasma cytokine levels and PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression  was evaluated in circulating CD3+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cells from 70 treatment-naïve patients with advanced NSCLC (Stage IIIB and IV) and from 10 healthy donors. The primary objective was to assess OS according to PD-1, PD-L1,  PD-L2 expression status on PBMCs and lymphocyte subsets. Our results indicate that the percentage of PD-L1+CD3+, PD-L1+CD3+CD8+ PD-L2+PBMCs, PD-L2+CD3+, PD-L2+CD3+CD4+ cells was higher in patients than in healthy donors.

PD-L1 expression is upregulated in many solid tumors including lung cancer and functions predominantly in lactate-enriched tumor microenvironments. Here, we provided evidence for PD-L1 induction in response to lactate stimulation in lung cancer cells. Lactate-induced PD-L1 induction was mediated by its receptor GPR81. The silencing of GPR81 signaling in lung cancer cells resulted in a decrease in PD-L1 protein levels and functional inactivation of PD-L1 promoter activity. In addition, GPR81-mediated upregulation of PD-L1 in glucose-stimulated lung cancer  cells that recapitulates the enhanced glycolysis in vivo was dependent on lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). We also demonstrated that activation of GPR81 decreases intracellular cAMP levels and inhibits protein kinase A (PKA) activity, leading to activation of the transcriptional coactivator TAZ. Interaction of TAZ with the transcription factor TEAD was essential for TAZ activation of PD-L1 and induction of its expression. Furthermore, we found that lactate-induced activation of PD-L1 in tumor cells led to reduced production of interferon-γ and induction of apoptosis of cocultured Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of lactate in contributing to tumor cell protection from cytotoxic T-cell targeting and establishes a direct connection between tumor cell metabolic reprograming and tumor evasion from the immune response."

Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the characteristics of irAEs associated with the use of such drugs. Methods: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched to find potential studies using the following strategies: anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment; irAEs; and cancer. R package Meta was used to pool incidence. Results: Forty-six studies representing  12,808 oncologic patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents were included in the meta-analysis. The anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents included nivolumab, pembrolizumab,  atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and BMS-936559. The tumor types were melanomas, Hodgkin lymphomas, urothelial carcinomas, breast cancers, non-small cell lung cancers, renal cell carcinomas (RCC), colorectal cancers, and others. We described irAEs according to organ systems, namely, the skin (pruritus, rash,  maculopapular rash, vitiligo, and dermatitis), endocrine system (hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and adrenal insufficiency), digestive system (colitis, diarrhea, pancreatitis, and increased AST/ALT/bilirubin), respiratory system (pneumonitis, lung infiltration, and interstitial lung disease), and urinary system (increased creatinine, nephritis, and renal failure). In patients treated with the PD-1 signaling inhibitors, the overall incidence of irAEs was 26.82% (95% CI, 21.73-32.61; I2, 92.80) in any grade and 6.10% (95% CI, 4.85-7.64; I2, 52.00) in severe grade, respectively. The development of irAEs was unrelated to the dose of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents. The incidence of particular irAEs varied when different cancers were treated with different drugs. The incidence of death due to irAEs was around 0.17%. The occurrence of irAEs was organ-specific and related to drug and tumor types."

The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) protein is an immunoinhibitory receptor  expressed by activated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that seek out and destroy cancer cells. Multiple cancer types express and upregulate the Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) which bind to PD-1 as an immune escape mechanism. Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved for treatment of multiple cancer types. This study reports the preparation and in vivo evaluation of 89Zr labeled nivolumab in healthy non-human primates (NHP) as a preliminary study of biodistribution and clearance. The radiochemical and in vivo stabilities of the 89Zr complex were shown to be acceptable for imaging. Three naïve NHPs were intravenously injected with tracer  only or tracer co-injected with nivolumab followed by co-registered by positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), acquired for eight days following injection. Image-derived standardized uptake values (SUV) were quantified by region of interest (ROI) analysis. Radioactivity in the spleen was significantly reduced by addition of excess nivolumab compared to the tracer  only study at all imaging time points. Liver uptake of the radiotracer was consistent as a clearance organ with minimal signal from other tissues: lung, muscle, brain, heart, and kidney. The results indicate specific biodistribution to the spleen, which can be blocked by co-administration of excess nivolumab. Distribution to other organs is consistent with elimination pathways of antibodies, with primary clearance through the liver."

In this study, we investigated the role of CD73 on the activity of the anti-HER2/ErbB2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab. In a prospective, randomized phase III clinical trial evaluating the activity of trastuzumab, high levels of CD73 gene expression were  associated significantly with poor clinical outcome. In contrast, high levels of  PD-1 and PD-L1 were associated with improved clinical outcome. In immunocompetent mouse models of HER2/ErbB2-driven breast cancer, CD73 expression by tumor cells and host cells significantly suppressed immune-mediated responses mediated by anti-ErbB2 mAb. Furthermore, anti-CD73 mAb therapy enhanced the activity of anti-ErbB2 mAb to treat engrafted or spontaneous tumors as well as lung metastases. Gene ontology enrichment analysis from gene-expression data revealed  a positive association of CD73 expression with extracellular matrix organization, TGFβ genes, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factors and  hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF)-1 gene signature. Human mammary cells treated with TGFβ or undergoing EMT upregulated CD73 cell-surface expression, confirming roles for these pathways. In conclusion, our findings establish CD73 in mediating resistance to trastuzumab and provide new insights into how CD73 is regulated in  breast cancer."

Certain checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for use in Canada, and are becoming a mainstay in the treatment of melanoma and other malignancies. These drugs have a unique side effect profile and are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These adverse events often appear to originate from an infectious etiology, when in fact they result from the enhanced immune response caused by immune checkpoint therapy. IrAEs are primarily treated with corticosteroids, which suppress the overactive immune response that is secondary to the treatment. IrAEs can occur in any organ system, but adverse events in the skin, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and pulmonary systems are among the most common. As an emergency physician, one must be familiar with these drugs and their adverse events in order to identify patients presenting with irAE and treat them accordingly. This paper provides a brief introduction to immune checkpoint inhibitors, discusses the most common irAEs relevant to emergency physicians, and gives suggestions on how to manage patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) suffering from irAEs."

We searched Medline database using the keywordsPD-1 inhibitor,PD-L1 inhibitor,Pembrolizumab,Nivolumab,Atezolizumabcombined withPneumonitisby Mar 31, 2017. Results: The patient was a 60-year-old male presented with progression disease after surgery, local radiation and couples of  chemotherapy for his esophageal carcinoma. Then pembrolizumab, a kind of PD-l inhibitors, was given intravenously every 3 weeks with the average dosage 3 mg per kg. After six cycles of pembrolizumab, the patient began to have fever, cough and dyspnea, which aggravated gradually. Chest CT showed diffuse ground glass opacity, exudation and consolidation in both lungs and little pleural effusion in the right side. Cellular interstitial pneumonitis was confirmed by pathological examination. The patient's symptoms were alleviated after enough steroids and chest CT showed pulmonary infiltration was also absorbed. But the pneumonitis reoccurred twice after stopping or tapering steroids quickly and could also be controlled by using steroids again. Now the patient was still given steroids treatment and the primary esophageal cancer remained stable. 14 articles were retrieved and 88 cases of immune-related pneumonitis caused by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were reported. Among these 89 cases with immune-related pneumonitis, both male and female could attack and the median age was 67 years old. Most cases were grade 1 or 2. The common clinical manifestations were dyspnea, cough, fever  and other immune-related damages. And about 20% patients had no symptoms. Ground  glass opacities, reticular opacities, consolidation and centrilobular nodules were the common radiological features.

Since anti-PD-1 re-activates  anti-tumor Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) responses, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms regulating HLA class I, and PD-L1 expression in HLA-negative SCLC. Here we addressed the role of IL-27, a cytokine related to both IL-6 and IL-12 families. The human SCLC cell lines NCI-N592, -H69, -H146, -H446 and -H82 were treated in vitro with different cytokines (IL-27, IFN-γ, IL-6 or a soluble IL-6R/IL-6 chimera [sIL-6R/IL-6]) at different time points and analyzed for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT proteins by Western blot, for surface molecule expression by immunofluorescence and FACS analyses or for specific mRNA expression by QRT-PCR. Relative quantification of mRNAs was calculated by the ΔΔCT method. The Student's T test was used for the statistical analysis of experimental replicates. IL-27 triggered STAT1/3 phosphorylation and up-regulated the expression  of surface HLA class I antigen and of TAP1 and TAP2 mRNA in four out of five SCLC cell lines tested. The IL-27-resistant NCI-H146 cells showed up-regulation of HLA class I by IFN-γ. IFN-γ also induced expression of PD-L1 in SCLC cells, while IL-27 was less potent in this respect. IL-27 failed to activate STAT1/3 phosphorylation in NCI-H146 cells, which display a low expression of the IL-27RA  and GP130 receptor chains. As GP130 is shared in IL-27R and IL-6R complexes, we assessed its functionality in response to sIL-6R/IL-6. sIL-6R/IL-6 failed to trigger STAT1/3 signaling in NCI-H146 cells, suggesting low GP130 expression or uncoupling from signal transduction. Although both sIL-6R/IL-6 and IL-27 triggered STAT1/3 phosphorylation, sIL-6R/IL-6 failed to up-regulate HLA class I  expression, in relationship to the weak activation of STAT1. Finally sIL-6R/IL-6  limited IL-27-effects, particularly in NCI-H69 cells, in a SOCS3-independent manner, but did not modify IFN-γ induced HLA class I up-regulation. In conclusion, IL-27 is a potentially interesting cytokine for restoring HLA class I expression for SCLC combined immunotherapy purposes. However, the concomitant activation of the IL-6 pathway may limit the IL-27 effect on HLA class I induction but did not significantly alter the responsiveness to IFN-γ."

However, the association between the clinical parameters and efficacy of nivolumab remains unclear in advanced NSCLC patients. Results: Among 124 patients, 108 (88%) were performance status (PS) 0 to 1. PD-L1 expression was assessed in 89 patients, with 51 (57%) patients having PD-L1 positive expression. In all patients, the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with elevated CRP levels (≥ 1 mg/dl) was significantly worse than those  without elevated CRP levels (< 1 mg/dl) (8.3 vs 23.4%, p = 0.0180). The PS (≥ 2), smoking index (< 400), CRP levels (≥ 1 mg/dl) and LDH (≥ 245 IU/L) were significantly associated with a shorter PFS and OS in patients treated with nivolumab. Multivariate analyses showed that the PS (≥ 2), smoking index (< 400), CRP levels (≥ 1 mg/dl) and LDH (≥ 245 IU/L) and PD-L1 expression were significant factors associated with a longer PFS of nivolumab. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 124 patients who received nivolumab as a subsequent treatment. The patient characteristics, laboratory data at baseline (C-reactive protein [CRP] and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]), PD-L1 expression, nivolumab response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.

Recently, the anti-PD1 agent pembrolizumab was granted FDA approval for the first line treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors show PD-L1 expression in ≥ 50% of neoplastic cells and as a second line treatment for patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 in ≥1% of neoplastic cells, evaluated with a validated assay. For the large majority of patients such evaluation is made on small biopsies. However, small tissue samples such as core biopsies might not be  representative of tumors and may show divergent results given the possible heterogeneous immunoexpression of the biomarker. We therefore sought to evaluate  PD-L1 expression concordance in a cohort of 239 patients using tissue microarrays (TMA) as surrogates of biopsies stained with a validated PD-L1 immunohistochemical assay (SP263) and report the degree of discordance among tissue cores in order to understand how such heterogeneity could affect decisions regarding therapy. We observed a discordance rate of 20% and 7.9% and a Cohen's κ value of 0.53 (moderate) and 0,48 (moderate) for ≥ 1% and ≥ 50% cutoffs, respectively. Our results suggest that caution must be taken when evaluating single biopsies from patients with advanced NSCLC eligible for immunotherapy; moreover, at least 4 biopsies are necessary in order to minimize the risk of tumor misclassification."

Methods: Medline, EMBASE and COCHRANE databases were searched to identify prospective monotherapy trials of ICIs from 2003 to November 2015. Paired reviewers selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Odds ratio (OR), χ2  tests and multivariable regression models were used to analyse for effect size and associations. Results: We identified 48 trials (6938 patients), including 26 CTLA-4, 17 PD-1, 2 PD-L1 trials, and 3 studies tested both CTLA-4 and PD-1. Grade 3/4 irAE were more common with CTLA-4 mAbs compared with PD-1 (31% versus 10%). All grades colitis (OR 8.7, 95% CI 5.8-12.9), hypophysitis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 3.0-14.3) and rash (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.8-2.3) were more frequent with CTLA-4 mAbs; whereas pneumonitis (OR 6.4, 95% CI 3.2-12.7), hypothyroidism (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.9-6.3), arthralgia (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.6-4.8) and vitiligo (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.3-5.3) were more common with  PD-1 mAbs. Comparison of irAE from the three most studied tumour types in PD-1 mAbs trials [melanoma (n = 2048), non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 1030) and renal cell carcinoma (n = 573)] showed melanoma patients had a higher frequency of gastrointestinal and skin irAE and lower frequency of pneumonitis. Discussion: CTLA-4 and PD-1 mAbs have distinct irAE profiles. Different immune microenvironments may drive histology-specific irAE patterns. Other tumour-dependent irAE profiles may be identified as data emerge from ICI trials."

Immunotherapy, unlike classical chemotherapy and  targeted drugs, may yield long-term survival, even in patients who stop treatment due to toxicity. This fact has generated considerable excitement and a real shift in the paradigm of cancer treatment. However, only a small subset of patients benefit from immunotherapy. Survival curves show that most patients have progression of the disease in the first months after starting immunotherapy, followed by a slower decrease over the first 3 years, until curves reach a plateau. This early progression suggests the presence of mechanisms for primary resistance. In addition, some patients have tumor relapse after years of response, suggesting that there is also acquired resistance in a small subset of  patients. Resistance mechanisms are now being elucidated. PD-L1 expression in tumor and immune cells correlates with higher chances of response, but melanoma patients with PD-L1 negative tumors can also respond. Several studies have demonstrated an increased probability of clinical benefit when tumors are infiltrated by CD8 T cells, have a high mutation burden or have an interferon gamma signature. But none of these factors has been implemented in the clinical practice, since more studies confirming their value are needed, as well as the development of standardized techniques."

From biological aspect, any existence of metastases is a sign of systemic disease. Due to the reports of long survival with only local treatment and without systemic disease in oligometastatic lung cancer, word of oligometastasis is used with fascinating  expectation of cure to advanced lung cancer. Most of the previous reports are retrospective and no comprehensive data exists for selecting patient for local treatment to oligometastasis. Recent positive result of randomize phase II study  is followed up with phase III study. Progress in treatment of advanced non-small  cell lung cancer with targeted therapy to oncogenic-driver(EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and others) and immune-checkpoint inhibitor(PD-1 pathway inhibitors)makes it difficult to define the appropriate indication of local treatment to oligometastatic lung cancer."

Antibodies that block these receptors increase antitumor immunity in patients with melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal cell cancer. Tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been found to be functionally compromised. We analyzed HCC samples from patients to determine if these inhibitory pathways prevent T-cell responses in HCCs and to find ways to restore their antitumor functions. We collected HCC samples from 59 patients who underwent surgical resection from November 2013 through May 2017, along with tumor-free liver tissues (control tissues) and peripheral blood samples. We isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and intra-hepatic lymphocytes. We used flow  cytometry to quantify expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (TIM3), lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3), and CTLA4 on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells from tumor, control tissue, and blood; we studied the effects of antibodies that block these pathways in T-cell activation assays. Expression of PD-1, TIM3, LAG3, and CTLA4 was significantly higher on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells isolated from HCC tissue than control tissue or blood. Dendritic cells, monocytes, and B cells in HCC tumors expressed ligands for these receptors. Expression of PD-1, TIM3, and LAG3 was higher on tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific CD8+ TIL, compared with other CD8+ TIL. Compared with TIL  that did not express these inhibitory receptors, CD8+ and CD4+ TIL that did express these receptors had higher levels of markers of activation, but similar or decreased levels of granzyme B and effector cytokines. Antibodies against CD274 (PD-ligand1 [PD-L1]), TIM3, or LAG3 increased proliferation of CD8+ and CD4+ TIL and cytokine production in response to stimulation with polyclonal antigens or TAA. Importantly, combining antibody against PD-L1 with antibodies against TIM3, LAG3, or CTLA4 further increased TIL functions. The immune checkpoint inhibitory molecules PD-1, TIM3, and LAG3 are  up-regulated on TAA-specific T cells isolated from human HCC tissues, compared with T cells from tumor-free liver tissues or blood. Antibodies against PD-L1, TIM3, or LAG3 restore responses of HCC-derived T cells to tumor antigens, and combinations of the antibodies have additive effects. Strategies to block PD-L1,  TIM3, and LAG3 might be developed for treatment of primary liver cancer."

PD-L1 expression has been indicated in identifying non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients for treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathologic values of PD-L1 expression and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PD-L1 gene in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous  cell carcinoma (SqCC). The 147 NSCLC tissues consisted of 84 samples of ADC and 63 samples of SqCC. All tissue microarray paraffin blocks were used for PD-L1 immunohistochemical assays with 22C3, SP263, and SP142 clones. Three SNPs in the  PD-L1 gene, rs4143815, rs822336, and rs822337, were genotyped using SNP pyrosequencing. The PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in SqCC than in ADC. Among ADCs, PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in papillary and solid types than in lepidic and acinar types. Statistical associations of the PD-L1 expression with a shorter disease-free survival outcome and lymph node metastasis in the ADCs were found but no associations in SqCCs. Among the three SNPs, the rs4143815 genotype CC was statistically associated with positive 22C3 PD-L1 labeling in NSCLCs. The rs4143815 genotype GG instead showed a trend of shorter survival outcomes but did not reach statistical significance in the ADCs. Our results showed a significantly higher prevalence of positive PD-L1 expression in  lung SqCC than in ADC. However, the PD-L1 expression and rs4143815 genotype GG might be useful for the prediction of poor prognosis in lung ADC cases."

In this narrative review, the current clinical efficacy and safety data of anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) nivolumab for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell cancer (RCC) are elucidated. Methods: Systematic search was done on Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Central through September 2016 for controlled prospective interventional studies of nivolumab across two indications - NSCLC and RCC. There was heterogeneity at all levels of abstraction; hence, author did not plan to provide a meta-analysis, but instead, a narrative elaboration of results structured around the conceptual frameworks. Results: Checkpoint receptor PD-1 is a negative regulatory molecule expressed by  activated T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death-ligands 1 and 2, results in the downregulation of lymphocyte activation. Nivolumab is a fully human PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Nivolumab inhibits the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands and promotes immune responses including antitumor immune response and antigen-specific T-cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-antigens. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration granted fast track designation for nivolumab in NSCLC, RCC, and melanoma. The encouraging literature on nivolumab lends credibility to the promise of immune checkpoint blockade, not just in terms of its feasibility as an oncotherapeutic strategy but also as a key tool of the future in the therapeutic  approaches against advanced cancers."

In present study, we investigated whether PA-MSHA injection enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of CIK cells. Twenty patients with malignancies were enrolled in this retrospective clinical trial. They were divided into two groups: 10 patients received PA-MSHA treated CIK cells transfusion combined with chemotherapy, and other patients accepted CIK cells and chemotherapy. The efficacy of PA-MSHA treated CIK cells was also observed in vitro and in vivo. With PA-MSHA treatment  CIK cells exhibited enhanced proliferation but decreased expression of inhibitory cell surface markers such as Tim-3 and PD-1. Particularly in CIK cells, PA-MSHA promoted the extrusion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-γ. Of 10 patients with PA-MSHA treated CIK cells and chemotherapy, two patients reached partial remissions, 7 patients had stable disease and the other one had progressive disease. Some of these patients experienced fever after cell infusion. 8 patients with CIK cells showed stable disease and 2 patients had progressive disease. Moreover, the side effects were small in patients with CIK treatment. Our data indicated that PA-MSHA improves the functions of CIK cells and shed new light on  developing more potent therapeutic approaches for malignancies."

Furthermore, PD-L1 positive melanoma has shown more favorable outcomes when treated with anti-PD1 antibodies  and dacarbazine compared to PD-L1 negative melanoma. However, the role of PD-L1 expression with regard to response to checkpoint inhibition with anti-CTLA-4 is not clear, yet. In addition, the lack of standardization in the immunohistochemical assessment of PD-L1 makes the comparison of results difficult. In this study, we investigated the PD-L1 gene expression with a new fully automated technique via RT-PCR and correlated the findings with the response to the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab. Within a retrospective multi-center trial, PD-L1 gene expression was evaluated in 78 melanoma patients in a total of 111 pre-treatment  tumor samples from 6 skin cancer centers and analyzed with regard to response to  ipilimumab. For meaningful statistical analysis, the cohort was enriched for responders with 30 responders and 48 non-responders. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR after extracting mRNA from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue and correlated with results from immunohistochemical (IHC)  stainings. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The evaluation of PD-L1 expression based on mRNA level is feasible. Correlation between PD-L1 expression as assessed by IHC and RT-PCR showed varying levels of concordance depending on the antibody employed. RT-PCR should be further investigated to measure PD-L1 expression, since it is a semi-quantitative method with observer-independent evaluation. With this approach, there was no statistical significant difference in the PD-L1 expression between responders and non-responders to the therapy with ipilimumab.

These agents are generally well tolerated, however severe immune-related adverse effects have been noted in a small, but clinically significant percentage of patients. Specifically, sarcoidosis is a known potential complication following anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We present 2 cases of pulmonary and cutaneous sarcoidosis developing in patients with stage IV melanoma. Both patients were treated with ipilimumab and anti-PD-1 therapy, and both experienced good oncologic responses to treatment; neither had evidence of preexisting sarcoidosis. Of note, both patients developed sarcoidosis only after  undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In 1 patient, sarcoidosis developed after initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy, 3 months after the last dose of  anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy, suggesting a synergistic immune dysmodulating effect of  both checkpoint inhibitors. Ultimately, both patients' symptoms and radiologic findings resolved with corticosteroid treatment, and both patients have tolerated retreatment with PD-1 inhibitors. Sarcoidosis is a rare complication of immune checkpoint inhibitors and can manifest with severe pulmonary manifestations. However, sarcoidosis in this setting is responsive to corticosteroids and does not necessarily recur with retreatment. It is yet unclear whether the development of sarcoidosis in these patients represents unmasking of preexisting autoimmune tendencies or is a marker of oncologic response."

Interactions with calf-thymus DNA (CT-DNA) were followed by absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence quenching measurements. All complexes can bind to CT-DNA exhibiting high intrinsic binding constants (Kb=104-105M-1). Competitive studies with ethidium bromide (EB) have shown that complexes can displace DNA-bound EB. High values of binding constants towards bovine serum albumin protein (BSA) indicate good binding affinity. Finally, all complexes showed moderate to high cytotoxic activity against HeLa (human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell lines) and MDA-MB-231 (human breast epithelial carcinoma cell lines) tumor cell lines inducing apoptotic type cell death, whereas normal fibroblasts were significantly less sensitive.

This paper describes the recently identified  feature of pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics, the time-dependent or time-varying CL. Overall results indicate that CL decreases over the treatment period of a typical patient in a pattern well described by a sigmoidal function of time with three parameters: the maximum proportion change in CL from baseline (approximately Imax or exactly eImax - 1), the time to reach Imax/2 (TI50), and a Hill coefficient. Best overall response per response evaluation criteria in solid tumor category was found to be associated with the magnitude of Imax."

The objective of this retrospective study was to determine if single-agent chemotherapy (3rd-line or beyond) would yield improved ORR when given after exposure to programmed death-(ligand)1 inhibitors (anti-PD1) in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We queried the Thoracic GEMINI database of MD Anderson Cancer Center for patients treated between 06/12 and 11/16 who received at least  one single-agent chemotherapy as 3rd-line or beyond, following progression after  platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-PD1. We evaluated efficacy outcomes to each  therapy, including ORR by RECIST version 1.1, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Out of 306 anti-PD1-treated patients registered in the database, 28 met  eligibility criteria - 54% were male, median age was 66 years, 82% had adenocarcinoma, and 71% were former/current smokers. The anti-PD1 and single-agent chemotherapy most commonly used were nivolumab (86%) and docetaxel (50%), respectively. ORR to single-agent chemotherapy after exposure to anti-PD1  was 39% (11/28 patients, 8 confirmed). In contrast, ORR to first-line chemotherapy in this cohort was 37%. Liver metastasis was the only factor associated with response to single-agent chemotherapy on univariate analysis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: In NSCLC patients, the confirmed ORR to single-agent chemotherapy after immunotherapy exposure was higher as compared to historical data from the pre-anti-PD1 era, and approached ORR to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Further investigation of a possible immunotherapy-induced chemosensitization effect is warranted."

Antibodies that block this pathway offer a promising new approach to treatment in advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A systematic review of the literature was conducted to assess the association of PD-L1 with important patient and disease characteristics, the prognostic significance of PD-L1 expressing NSCLC tumors, and the value of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker of response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments in advanced/metastatic NSCLC. A total of 35 eligible studies were selected for analysis. Methods used to determine PD-L1 in NSCLC tissue varied considerably; with different PD-L1 antibodies, antibody detection methods, and staining cut-offs. Immunohistochemistry was the most frequent type of PD-L1 assay. Overall, study evidence did not support an association between PD-L1 expression and gender, age, smoking history, tumor histology (adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma), performance status, pathologic tumor grade or EGFR/KRAS/ALK mutational status. In several studies, high PD-L1 expression was associated with shorter survival compared with low expression. Most evidence indicated that patients with high vs. low PD-L1 expression were more likely to experience treatment benefit with anti-PD-1/PD-L1  agents (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab, and avelumab) in advanced NSCLC. Variability in the methods used to determine PD-L1 expression in  NSCLC tissue suggests a need for standardized use of well-validated PD-L1 diagnostic assays. Although considerable research links PD-L1 expression in tumors to shorter survival in advanced/metastatic NSCLC, its use as a prognostic  factor requires more study. As studies of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents continue, PD-L1  is likely to play an important role as a predictive biomarker for selecting patients deriving most benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy and directing patients with lower levels of tumor PD-L1 expression (with a high unmet medical need), to alternative treatments, such as combination immunotherapies."

The field of immunotherapy has brought potent new drugs into the oncological armamentarium, and is becoming recognized as a potentially important  arm in the treatment of glioblastoma for adults. Immune checkpoints are inhibitory receptors found on immune cells that, when stimulated, cause those immune cells to become quiescent. While this is a natural mechanism to prevent excessive inflammatory damage and autoimmunity in otherwise healthy tissues, cancer cells may utilize this process to grow in the absence of targeted immune destruction. Antibodies derived to block the stimulation of these negative checkpoints, allowing immune cells to remain activated and undergo effector function, are a growing area of immunotherapy. These therapies have seen much success in both the preclinical and clinical arenas for various tumors, particularly melanoma and nonsmall-cell lung cancer. Multiple clinical trials are underway to determine if these drugs have efficacy in glioblastoma. Here, we review the current evidence, from early preclinical data to lessons learned from  clinical trials outside of glioblastoma, to assess the potential of immune checkpoint inhibition in the treatment of brain tumors and discuss how this therapy may be implemented with the present standard of care."

PD-L1 expression in cancer cells has been reported to be a predictive factor for the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy. However, the mechanism of PD-L1 expression remains unclear. Another key process in cancer progression is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of PD-L1 expression as well as changes in its expression during the EMT process in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, A549 cells underwent EMT by treatment with TGF-β or chemotherapeutic agents and then PD-L1 expression was evaluated. The alterations of PD-L1 expression was also examined during the reverse EMT process; mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). The relationship between for PD-L1 expression and EMT status in clinical specimens with NSCLC after induction chemotherapy were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. We found that PD-L1 expression was upregulated following TGF-β induction; in contrast, it was downregulated by TGF-β receptor-kinase inhibitors and the MET process. Furthermore, chemo-treatment increased TGF-β expression and enhances PD-L1 expression via autocrine TGF-β induced EMT. Analysis of clinical samples revealed a significant relationship between PD-L1 expression and EMT status (P<0.05). In conclusion, our results suggest that PD-L1 expression is regulated by TGF-β induced EMT and enhanced by chemo-treatment via the chemo-induced TGF-β signaling. The anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may provide more effective anticancer activities in combination with chemotherapy in NSCLC."

We hypothesized that an immunological interaction with tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes (CD8+ TILs) would contribute to PD‑L1 expression in tumor cells. To verify this hypothesis, we examined the effect of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a cytokine secreted by CD8+ TILs, on PD‑L1 expression in pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas in vitro. We also evaluated the expression of  PD‑L1 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on tumor cells and CD8+ TILs in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung (n=77) by immunohistochemistry. IFN-γ upregulated PD‑L1 expression on pulmonary squamous carcinoma cells, and the reaction was reversible. In cases where which MHC class I molecule-positive tumor cells were dominant (n=72, 93.5%), cases in which PD‑L1-positive tumor cells were dominant (PD‑L1+ tumor cell‑dominant cases; n=45) were more frequently observed than PD‑L1-negative tumor cell‑dominant cases (n=27) (P=0.006). The number of CD8+ TILs was significantly higher in PD‑L1+ tumor cell‑dominant cases compared with PD‑L1- tumor cell‑dominant cases (P=0.005).

The activation of T‑lymphocytes is influenced by a new class of antibody-based medication, the immune checkpoint inhibitors. Review of the scientific background and the published clinical trials on the activity and approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for various tumor diseases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors function by activating T‑lymphocytes during the priming (CTLA4) or effector phase (PDL1/PD1). Activated tumor-specific T‑lymphocytes in turn can attack the tumor. For malignant melanoma, a combination of both checkpoint inhibitors is approved and achieves response rates of 60%. The PD1 inhibitors are active against non-small cell lung cancer achieving a progression-free survival (PFS) of 12 months and a survival rate of 60% at 24 months. For renal cell cancer and bladder cancer response rates to PD-1 inhibitors of approximately 25% and an improvement in overall survival (OS) up to 4 months compared to previous standard therapies have been reported. CONCLUSION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are active against a number of tumors. In some cases, such as malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, the response rates are impressive and exceed those achieved with conventional chemotherapies.

In contrast, in a spontaneous model of intestinal tumorigenesis, absence of BLT1 led to defective mucosal host response, altered microbiota and bacteria dependent colon tumor progression. Furthermore, BLT1 mediated CD8+ T cell recruitment was shown to be essential for initiating anti-tumor immunity in number of xenograft models and is critical for effective PD1 based immunotherapy. BLT2 mediated chemotherapy resistance, tumor promotion and metastasis are also discussed. This new information points to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the LTB4 pathways  in cancer."

A workshop organized by three MASCC Study Groups: Oral Care, Skin Toxicities, and Neutropenia, Infection, and Myelosuppression during the MASCC Annual Meeting held in Adelaide, Australia on 23-25 June, 2016 focused on the new class of anti-cancer therapeutic agents. Topics in the workshop included the mechanism of  action and clinical uses of immune anti-CTL4 and anti-PD1 antibodies, checkpoint  inhibitor toxicities, including skin adverse events, gastrointestinal toxicities, oral complications, pulmonary toxicities, and endocrinological and immune-related infections. Checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for use in different malignancies including metastatic melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer,  metastatic renal cell carcinoma, refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma, metastatic bladder cancer, and advanced head and neck cancer, and the list continues to grow. In general, these agents seem to be better tolerated in most patients and less toxic compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, the toxicities here, termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs), are unique and different from what  we have seen in the past. There is no prospective data on these toxicities, and guidelines or recommendations are currently based on symptomatic management from  the ongoing clinical trials. Treating oncologists need to be aware and alert themselves to the subtleties in presentation and the big difference in the way we manage the irAEs. Although most irAEs are low-grade and manageable, they have the potential to be life-threatening and extremely severe if not promptly treated. Additionally, irAEs could even lead to death, if managed incorrectly. The MASCC workshop addressed the various irAEs, per organ system, clinical presentation, management recommendations, and individual toxicities."

Several PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been approved by health authorities for this indication and others are in clinical development. However, only a subset of patients truly benefits from these agents. For patients with mutated EGFR or translocated ALK NSCLC, for whom an immune checkpoint inhibitor can be prescribed after progression on tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chemotherapy, information is  scarce and sometimes contradictory. Phase III randomized clinical trials have evaluated different immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab) vs. chemotherapy as second- or subsequent-line therapy in NSCLC, but included very few patients with EGFR/ALK-positive disease. Subgroup analyses  found that these patients did not benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. Retrospective data show progression-free survival lasting only 1.2-2.1 months. Preclinical data suggested a lower expression of PD-L1 in EGFR/ALK-positive patients compared to EGFR/ALK-negative patients. Our objective herein is to provide an up-to-date review of available data from the various publications on the impact of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with EGFR/ALK-positive NSCLC."

In recent years, immunotherapeutic regimens, that target immune checkpoints, demonstrated significant antitumor response by increasing intra-tumoral immune cell populations, including CD8+ effector T cells. However, administration of such immune checkpoint inhibitors is largely inefficacious in inducing immunogenicity and treating breast cancer. Currently, there is a great need to better understand cell autonomous mechanisms of immune evasion in breast cancer to identify upstream therapeutic targets that increase the efficacy of immunotherapy. Here we show that Crk, an SH2 and SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein implicated in focal adhesion signaling, cell migration, and invasion, and frequently up-regulated in human cancers, has an important role in regulating the tumor immune microenvironment. Using a murine 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma model of spontaneous metastasis in immune-competent BALB/C mice, we show that genetic ablation of Crk by CRISPR-Cas9 leads to enhanced anti-tumor immune cell populations, cytotoxic effector and immune surveillance cytokines in primary tumor. Pathologically, this leads to a significant reduction in tumor growth and lung metastasis. Mechanistically, Crk KO suppresses EMT and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and acts additively with anti-PD1 therapy to suppress tumor growth and metastasis outcomes. Taken together, these data reveal a previously un-described function of Crk adaptor protein expression in tumor cells for cell autonomous regulation of tumor immune  microenvironment."

However, whether the anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy also promotes drug resistance as EGFR-TKIs treatment remains unclear. Thus, we conducted the present study to investigate the effects of anti-PD-1 therapy on the expression of PD-L1, which is one important factor mediates the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy. To address the expression dynamics of PD-L1 after anti-PD-1 therapy, we  first divided the patients into three groups according to the EGFR mutation status (wild type, L858R and T790M mutation). The PD-L1 was highly expressed in the NSCLC tissues than the corresponding normal tissues. After cancer recurrence, the PD-L1 was further up-regulated in patients treated with chemotherapy or EGFR-TKI therapy but decreased in the patients with anti-PD1 therapy. Promoter methylation analysis showed that the secondary NSCLC after cancer recurrence with anti-PD1 therapy had much higher promoter methylation level than the primary cancer tissue or normal tissues. In the mice model, the anti-PD-1 therapy could induce PD-L1 promoter methylation irrespective of EGFR mutation status. Combining DNA hypomethylating agent azacytidine with anti-PD-1 therapy could significantly  further reduce the tumor size when comparing with the anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Our results demonstrated that the anti-PD-1 therapy might promote drug resistance through PD-L1 promoter methylation and down-regulation. And combining DNA hypomethylating agent azacytidine with anti-PD-1 therapy might be a promising approach to overcome the resistance."

Targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs to the tumor-promoting M2-like TAMs is challenging. Here, we developed M2-like TAM dual-targeting nanoparticles (M2NPs), whose structure and function were controlled by α-peptide  (a scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1) targeting peptide) linked with M2pep (an M2 macrophage binding peptide). By loading anti-colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (anti-CSF-1R) small interfering RNA (siRNA) on the M2NPs, we developed a molecular-targeted immunotherapeutic approach to specifically block the survival  signal of M2-like TAMs and deplete them from melanoma tumors. We confirmed the validity of SR-B1 for M2-like TAM targeting and demonstrated the synergistic effect of the two targeting units (α-peptide and M2pep) in the fusion peptide (α-M2pep). After being administered to tumor-bearing mice, M2NPs had higher affinity to M2-like TAMs than to tissue-resident macrophages in liver, spleen, and lung. Compared with control treatment groups, M2NP-based siRNA delivery resulted in a dramatic elimination of M2-like TAMs (52%), decreased tumor size (87%), and prolonged survival. Additionally, this molecular-targeted strategy inhibited immunosuppressive IL-10 and TGF-β production and increased immunostimulatory cytokines (IL-12 and IFN-γ) expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration (2.9-fold) in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the siRNA-carrying M2NPs down-regulated expression of the exhaustion markers (PD-1 and Tim-3) on the infiltrating CD8+ T cells and stimulated their IFN-γ secretion  (6.2-fold), indicating the restoration of T cell immune function. Thus, the dual-targeting property of M2NPs combined with RNA interference provides a potential strategy of molecular-targeted cancer immunotherapy for clinical application."

Furthermore, epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-induced pneumonitis was reported after treatment with anti PD-1 antibodies. We previously demonstrated that mice with naphthalene-induced airway epithelial injury developed severe gefitinib-induced pneumonitis through a neutrophil-dependent mechanism. The present study aimed to investigate whether treatment with afatinib, an EGFR-TKI that effectively targets EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, and anti PD-1 antibodies induces pneumonitis in mice. C57BL/6J mice were treated intraperitoneally with naphthalene (200 mg/kg) on day 0. Afatinib (20 mg/kg) was administered orally on  days -1 to 13. An anti-PD-1 antibody (0.2 mg/mice) was also administered intraperitoneally every 3 days from day 1 until day 13. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissues were sampled on day 14. As observed previously with gefitinib, afatinib significantly increased the severity of histopathologic findings and the level of protein in BALF on day 14, compared to  treatment with naphthalene alone. A combined anti-PD-1 antibody and afatinib treatment after naphthalene administration had yielded the same histopathological grade of lung inflammation as did afatinib treatment alone. Our results suggest that anti-PD-1 antibody treatment has little effect on afatinib-induced lung injury."

Tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) dysfunction or exhaustion by upregulating inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) in tumor-bearing hosts is one such mechanism. Identification and blockade of the pathways that induce CTL dysfunction has been shown to partially restore CTL function in tumor-bearing hosts. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a rate-limiting enzyme for prostanoid biosynthesis, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and plays a key role in both inflammation and cancer. The disruption of COX2/PGE2 signaling using COX2 inhibitors or PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 antagonists, combined with anti-PD-1 blockade was therapeutic in terms of improving eradication of tumors and augmenting the numbers of functional tumor-specific CTLs. Thus, COX2/PGE2 axis inhibition is a promising adjunct therapy to PD-1 blockade for immune-based therapies in cancer."

Nowadays, 3rd generation EGFR TKI is widely used for T790M positive 1st and 2nd EGFR-TKI resistant lung cancer patients. Immunotherapy is powerful option for lung cancer patients without drug targets and chemotherapy resistant patients. It also has changed the concept of conventional anti-cancer therapy in the point of  regulating tumor microenvironment. There are many studies linking these two important pathways. Recent studies demonstrated that PD-L1 expression is significantly correlated to the mutation status of EGFR, and activation of EGFR signaling can also induce the expression of PD-L1. However, the real linker between PD-L1 and EGFR signaling remains to be revealed. Our previous study revealed that the Hippo pathway effector YAP confers EGFR-TKI resistance in lung  adenocarcinoma, and inhibition of YAP restores sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs. Thus, we examined whether PD-L1 is relevant, in terms of conferring EGFR-TKI resistance and whether YAP directly regulates the expression of PD-L1 in this context. First, we compared the expression levels of PD-L1 and YAP between EGFR-TKI-resistant PC9 cells and the parental PC9 adenocarcinoma cells. The expression levels of both YAP and PD-L1 were markedly higher in the EGFR-TKI-resistant cells compared to the parental cells, suggesting differential  expression pattern between two cell types. YAP knockdown significantly decreased  the expression of PD-L1 in the EGFR-TKI-resistant cells, while YAP overexpression increased the expression of PD-L1 in the parental PC9 cells. Then, our results revealed that YAP regulates the transcription of PD-L1, and the YAP/TEAD complex  binds to the PD-L1 promoter. Surprisingly, knockdown of PD-L1 was sufficient to decrease cell proliferation and wound healing in the EGFR-TKI-resistant PC9 cells. These data suggest a PD1-independent oncogenic function of PD-L1. The Hippo effector YAP plays a crucial role in linking the PD-L1 and EGFR-TKI resistance by directly regulating the expression of PD-L1 in lung cancer. Targeting PD-L1 directly or via YAP could provide an effective therapeutic strategy for EGFR-TKI-resistant lung adenocarcinoma."

Clinical protocols with accelerated nonablative hypofractionated radiation followed by surgery could provide an opportunity to implement immune checkpoint blockade.Experimental Design: We therefore assessed the impact of nonablative hypofractionated radiation on the immune system in combination with surgery in a mouse mesothelioma model. Blunt surgery (R1 resection) was used to analyze the short-term effect, and radical surgery (R0 resection) was used to analyze the long-term effect of this radiation protocol before surgery.Results: Nonablative hypofractionated radiation led to a specific  immune activation against the tumor associated with significant upregulation of CD8+ T cells, limiting the negative effect of an incomplete resection. The same radiation protocol performed 7 days before radical surgery led to a long-term antitumor immune protection that was primarily driven by CD4+ T cells. Radical surgery alone or with a short course of nonablative radiation completed 24 hours  before radical surgery did not provide this vaccination effect. Combining this radiation protocol with CTLA-4 blockade provided better results than radiation alone. The effect of PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade with this radiation protocol was less effective than the combination with CTLA-4 blockade.A specific activation of the immune system against the tumor contributes to the benefit of accelerated, hypofractionated radiation before surgery. Nonablative hypofractionated radiation combined with surgery provides an opportunity to introduce immune checkpoint blockades in the clinical setting."

After nivolumab treatment, hypopharyngeal SCC with moderate PD-L1 positivity by immunohistochemical staining showed a remarkable response; conversely, nivolumab  was not effective against lung adenocarcinoma, which was negative for PD-L1.

Thirty-one (12%), 17 (7%), 12(5%) cases were positive at percentage cut offs of >0, >5, and >10% respectively. Increased PD-L1 expression was associated with  inferior prognosis (p = 0.0367). No statistically significant association was identified between PD-L1 status and MMR status or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. This data suggests that there is an inverse relationship between PD-L1 expression and disease specific survival times in resected PDAC. Consequently, this association may represent a phenotype where increased PD-L1 expression has an effect on tumor biology and could therefore identify a subgroup where PD1 blockade could have enhanced effectiveness."

Nitric oxide and CerS6 signaling was required for drug-induced death receptor activation and tumor cell killing. In vivo, [pemetrexed + sildenafil] lethality against lung cancer cells was enhanced by sodium valproate. Using syngeneic mouse lung cancer cells [pemetrexed + sildenafil] enhanced the anti-tumor effects of antibodies directed to inhibit PD-1 or CTLA4. [Pemetrexed + sildenafil] interacted with the anti-PD-1 antibody to strongly enhance tumor infiltration by  M1 macrophages; activated NK cells and activated T cells. Our data demonstrate that treatment of tumor cells with [pemetrexed + sildenafil] results in tumor cell killing and via autophagy-dependent downregulation of HDACs, it opsonizes the remaining tumor cells to anti-tumor immunotherapy antibodies."

CONCLUSION: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a breakthrough in cancer treatment that has shown unprecedented success when used for a variety of malignancies. In recent phase 3 clinical trials for NSCLC, monoclonal antibodies  that target the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand PD-L1 (i.e., the PD-1/PD-L1 axis) were associated with better overall survival in head-to-head comparisons with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. On the strength of the results of these trials, the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the  PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab recently received regulatory approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Because of their unique mechanisms of action, these agents differ from conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in both patterns of treatment response and treatment-related adverse events. Given the rapidly expanding clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the central role of radiology in the care of patients with lung cancer, it is important for radiologists to be familiar with these agents and their unique imaging findings."

Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab have dramatically altered the treatment paradigm in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and have each demonstrated improvements in outcomes and quality of life when compared to chemotherapy. Enrichment strategies to better select those patients more likely to respond have identified PD-L1 staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to be a predictive biomarker in both treatment naïve and refractory patients. Unfortunately, many challenges exist with this strategy  and underscore the need for further exploration for more reliable biomarkers. Multiple tissue and plasma-based enrichment strategies have been identified in the hope of identifying patients more likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors. These include tumor mutational load; the inflamed phenotype including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) and immunoscore; T-cell receptor  clonality; gene signatures, and several plasma biomarkers. Several studies have revealed many of these biomarkers to be reliable predictors of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors across multiple tumor types. Given the small nature of these studies, additional prospective studies are warranted to formalize and validate each of these enrichment strategies."

Whether PD-L1 was regulated by mutant Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog  (KRAS) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the underlying molecular mechanism were largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the correlation between PD-L1 expression and KRAS mutation and the functional significance of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. We found that PD-L1 expression was associated with KRAS mutation both in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and tissues. PD-L1 was up-regulated by KRAS mutation through p-ERK but not p-AKT signaling. We also found that KRAS-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1 induced the apoptosis of CD3-positive T cells which was reversed by anti-PD-1 antibody (Pembrolizumab) or ERK inhibitor. PD-1 blocker or  ERK inhibitor could recover the anti-tumor immunity of T cells and decrease the survival rates of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells in co-culture system in vitro. However, Pembrolizumab combined with ERK inhibitor did not show synergistic effect on killing tumor cells in co-culture system. Our study demonstrated that KRAS mutation could induce PD-L1 expression through p-ERK signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may be a promising therapeutic strategy for human KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma."

Here, we studied the potential therapeutic and immune effects of one such combination: Ab to PD-1 with agonist Ab to OX40/vaccine. We tested the antitumor effects of different treatment sequencing of this combination. We report that simultaneous addition of anti-PD-1 to anti-OX40 negated the antitumor effects of OX40 Ab. Antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor was  diminished, the resultant antitumor response weakened, and survival reduced. Although we observed an increase in IFNγ-producing E7-specifc CD8+ T cells in the spleens of mice treated with the combination of PD-1 blockade with anti-OX40/vaccine, these cells underwent apoptosis both in the periphery and the  tumor. These results indicate that anti-PD-1 added at the initiation of therapy exhibits a detrimental effect on the positive outcome of anti-OX40 agonist Ab. These findings have important implications on the design of combination immunotherapy for cancer, demonstrating the need to test treatment combination and sequencing before moving to the clinic."

However, clinical response rates are less than 25%. Evaluation of combinations of immunotherapy with existing therapies requires appropriate preclinical animal models. In this study, murine lung cancer cells (CMT167 and LLC) were implanted either orthotopically in the lung or subcutaneously in syngeneic mice, and response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was determined. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy inhibited CMT167 orthotopic lung tumors by 95%. The same treatments inhibited CMT167 subcutaneous tumors by only 30% and LLC orthotopic lung tumors by 35%. CMT167 subcutaneous tumors had more Foxp3+ CD4+ T  cells and fewer PD-1+ CD4+ T cells compared with CMT167 orthotopic tumors. Flow cytometric analysis also demonstrated increased abundance of PD-L1high cells in the tumor microenvironment in CMT167 tumor-bearing lungs compared with CMT167 subcutaneous tumors or LLC tumor-bearing lungs. Silencing PD-L1 expression in CMT167 cells resulted in smaller orthotopic tumors that remained sensitive to anti-PD-L1 therapy, whereas implantation of CMT167 cells into PD-L1- mice blocked orthotopic tumor growth, indicating a role for PD-L1 in both the cancer cell and  the microenvironment. These findings indicate that the response of cancer cells to immunotherapy will be determined by both intrinsic properties of the cancer cells and specific interactions with the microenvironment. Experimental models that accurately recapitulate the lung tumor microenvironment are useful for evaluation of immunotherapeutic agents."

Immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that PD-L1 expression was correlated with the E6 expression in tumors from 122 lung cancer patients. The poorest survival occurred in PD-L1-positive/E6-positive tumor. PD-L1 expression was increased by the expression of E6, but not the E7, oncoprotein in lung and cervical cancer cells.  PD-L1 expression was responsible for E6-mediated colony formation and soft agar growth. Therefore, PD-L1 secreted from tumor cells may directly promote tumor progression, particularly in E6-positive tumors. Immune deficiency nude mice were used to test the possibility that combining anti-PD-L1 mAb with Lm-LLO-E6 vaccine could have a higher antitumor activity compared with anti-PD-L1 mAb or Lm-LLO-E6  vaccine alone. A greater antitumor activity was obtained with anti-PD-L1 mAb + Lm-LLO-E6 vaccine than with anti-PD-L1 mAb or Lm-LLO-E6 alone in subcutaneous and metastatic tumors induced by TL-1 and SiHa cells. The longest survival time for nude mice was observed in the anti-PD-L1 mAb + Lm-LLO-E6 vaccine group. In conclusion, an anti-PD-L1 mAb + Lm-LLO-E6 vaccine may be an efficient treatment for suppression of tumor growth and metastasis induced by HPV-infected cells."

The selective class I histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat has been reported to have immunomodulatory activity including targeting of immune suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, we decided to assess whether entinostat could enhance anti-PD-1 treatment and investigate those alterations in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that contribute to the combined antitumor activity. We utilized syngeneic mouse models of lung (LLC) and renal cell (RENCA) carcinoma and assessed immune correlates, tumor growth, and survival following treatment with entinostat (5 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) and a PD-1 inhibitor (10 and 20 mg/kg, s.c.). Entinostat enhanced the antitumor effect of PD-1 inhibition in two syngeneic mouse tumor models by reducing tumor growth and increasing survival. Entinostat inhibited the immunosuppressive function of both polymorphonuclear (PMN)- and monocytic-myeloid derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC) populations. Analysis of MDSC response to entinostat revealed significantly reduced arginase-1, iNOS, and COX-2 levels, suggesting potential mechanisms for the altered function. We also observed significant alterations in cytokine/chemokine  release in vivo with a shift toward a tumor-suppressive microenvironment. Our results demonstrate that entinostat enhances the antitumor effect of PD-1 targeting through functional inhibition of MDSCs and a transition  away from an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. These data provide a mechanistic rationale for the clinical testing and potential markers of response  of this novel combination in solid tumor patients."

New therapeutic approaches are urgently needed; however, novel combinations with immunotherapies and checkpoint inhibitors require suitable preclinical models with intact immune systems to be properly tested.Experimental  Design: We have developed immunocompetent osteosarcoma models that grow orthotopically in the bone and spontaneously metastasize to the lungs, mimicking  human osteosarcoma. These models have been used to test the efficacy of trabectedin, a chemotherapeutic drug utilized clinically for sarcomas and ovarian cancer.Results: Trabectedin, as monotherapy, significantly inhibited osteosarcoma primary tumor growth and lung metastases by both targeting neoplastic cells and reprogramming the tumor immune microenvironment. Specifically, trabectedin induced a striking differentiation of tumor cells by favoring the recruitment of  Runx2, the master genetic regulator of osteoblastogenesis, on the promoter of genes involved in the physiologic process of terminal osteoblast differentiation. Differentiated neoplastic cells, as expected, showed reduced proliferation rate.  Concomitantly, trabectedin enhanced the number of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes, with local CD8 T cells, however, likely post-activated or exhausted, as suggested by their high expression of the inhibitory checkpoint molecule PD-1. Accordingly, the combination with a PD-1-blocking antibody significantly increased trabectedin efficacy in controlling osteosarcoma progression.These results demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of trabectedin in osteosarcoma treatment, unveiling its multiple activities and providing a solid rationale for its combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors."

Associations between the marker levels, major clinicopathologic variables and survival were analyzed.Results: Expression of B7-H3 protein was found in 80.4% (510/634) of the cases. High B7-H3 protein level (top 10 percentile) was associated with poor overall survival (P <  0.05). Elevated B7-H3 was consistently associated with smoking history across the 3 cohorts, but not with sex, age, clinical stage, and histology. Coexpression of  B7-H3 and PD-L1 was found in 17.6% of the cases (112/634) and with B7-H4 in 10% (63/634). B7-H4 and PD-L1 were simultaneously detected only in 1.8% of NSCLCs (12/634). The expression of B7-H3 was not associated with the levels of CD3-, CD8-, and CD20-positive TILs.B7-H3 protein is expressed in the majority of NSCLCs and is associated with smoking history. High levels of B7-H3 protein have a negative prognostic impact in lung carcinomas. Coexpression of B7-H3 with PD-L1 and B7-H4 is relatively low, suggesting a nonredundant biological role of these targets."

The recent phase II POPLAR and phase III OAK studies showed that atezolizumab, a representative PD-L1 inhibitor, exhibited a survival benefit compared with standard therapy in patients with NSCLC. We examined PD-L1 expression in NSCLC using the clone SP142 of POPLAR and OAK studies. PD-L1 expression in 499 surgically resected NSCLC patients was evaluated using immunohistochemistry using SP142. We set cutoff values as 1%, 5%, 10%, and 50%. The samples from 189 (37.9%), 119 (23.8%), 71 (14.2%), and 39 (7.8%) patients were positive for PD-L1 expression at cutoff values of 1%, 5%, 10%, and  50%, respectively. Fisher exact tests showed that PD-L1 positivity was significantly associated with male sex, smoking, advanced stage, the presence of  vascular invasion, squamous cell carcinoma, and wild type epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation status at all cutoff values. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses revealed that PD-L1-positive patients had a worse prognosis than PD-L1-negative patients only at the 1% cutoff value. Forest plot analyses showed that the 1% cutoff provided a more sensitive value for the prediction of postoperative prognosis. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression varied greatly according to different cutoff values. This study might be a useful reference to understand the results of POPLAR and OAK studies and to select patients likely to benefit from atezolizumab."

RECENT FINDINGS: Several new systemic treatment options for brain metastases are  in early or advanced clinical trials. These drugs have good intracranial and extracranial activities. As lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma are the three most common causes of brain metastases, most agents in clinical development are focused on these tumor types. Several of these therapies are small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies against the tyrosine kinase receptors. Another exciting development in brain metastases management is the use of immunotherapy agents. The anti-CTLA-4 and\or anti-PD-1 antibodies have shown promising intracranial activity in melanoma and nonsmall cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases. Contemporary clinical trials have shown encouraging intracranial activity of newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies against tyrosine kinase receptors and immunotherapy agents in select group of patients with brain metastases.

The success witnessed with therapeutic agents targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, programmed cell death protein 1 and programmed cell death ligand 1 immune checkpoints has inevitably led to an explosion in their clinical application and  the subsequent recognition of specific toxicity profiles distinct from those long recognised with chemotherapy. Consequently, as the utility of such therapies broaden, understanding the nature, timing and management of these immune-related  adverse events (irAEs) becomes increasingly significant. Although neurological irAEs are considered relatively rare in comparison with hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis and endocrinopathies, one emerging side-effect is myasthenia gravis (MG). Among the 23 reported cases of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated MG, 72.7% were de novo presentations, 18.2% were exacerbations of pre-existing MG and 9.1% were exacerbations of subclinical MG. The average onset of symptoms was within 6 weeks (range 2-12 weeks) of treatment initiation. In addition, there was no consistent association with elevated acetylcholine antibody titres and the development of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related MG. Significantly, there was a 30.4% MG-specific-related mortality, which further emphasises the importance of early recognition and robust treatment of this toxicity. In addition to a review  of the existing literature, we present a new case of pembrolizumab-induced MG and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of action of this phenomenon."

Several immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently Food and Drug Administration approved which target various coinhibitory pathways including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1), and programmed cell death ligand-1. Clinical trials that lead to the Food and Drug Administration approval  of these agents often excluded patients with an organ transplant. Excluding these patients was deliberate due to concern that immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy could lead to graft rejection. The PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways are essential to downregulate our immune system in the setting of T-cell activation to prevent autoimmunity. Furthermore, both pathways are implicated in transplanted organ tolerance and modulation of the pathways may inadvertently lead to peripheral transplant rejection. Currently, there are no guidelines for the treatment of patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of a prior organ transplant. Thus far, there are only 10 reported cases of patients in the literature who were treated in this setting. Two additional cases are reported herein, including 1 patient with a prior cardiac transplant receiving nivolumab for non-small cell lung cancer. Of the 12 cases, 4 patients experienced organ rejection. From these observations, the authors hypothesize factors that affect safety and of this treatment modality in this patient population. These factors include the integral role of the PD-1 pathway compared with the CTLA-4 pathway in organ acceptance, sequential implementation of different immune checkpoint inhibitor classes, length of time with a transplant before therapy, strength of immunosuppressive agents to prevent organ transplant rejection, and immunogenicity of the particular organ grafted. Although limited cases have been  reported, there are circumstances in which immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used in the setting of organ transplantation without resulting in organ rejection. A thorough discussion with the patient of the potential risks, including graft rejection, and benefits of this therapy is necessary before beginning this treatment. More research is needed to explore the safety and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of organ transplantation."

Nivolumab shows better outcome compared to standard second line chemotherapy, but reliable prognostic markers are lacking. High neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are markers of host inflammation and associated with worse overall survival (OS) in several tumor types, but have not been analysed extensively in lung cancer in the era of immunotherapy. Patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with nivolumab were enrolled. Pre-treatment NLR and PLR were calculated by division of neutrophils and platelets by lymphocytes measured in peripheral blood. Cox regression analyses were conducted to study the prognostic role of NLR and PLR on OS and progression  free survival (PFS). Logistic regression was used to study the association of NLR and PLR. The combined impact of NLR and other known prognostic factors was explored with multivariable regression. Fifty-two patients were included. Elevated NLR was associated with worse OS (HR for log(NLR)=3.64, 95% CI 1.78-7.46, p<0.001) and lower response rates (OR for log(NLR)=0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.68, p=0.013). There was no significant association with PFS (HR for log(NLR)=1.46, 95% CI=0.91-2.34, p=0.114). The AUC for the prediction of 10-month survival using log(NLR) was 0.738, the AUC for the prediction of response to nivolumab was 0.776. Relationships with PLR were similar. NLR and PLR didn't correlate with other known prognostic factors (i.e histology, tobacco use, ECOG performance status,) in our cohort. Inclusion of NLR in multivariable models with these other factors significantly improved the prediction of OS. CONCLUSION: Elevated pre-treatment NLR and PLR are associated with shorter OS and PFS and with lower response rates in patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with  nivolumab independently of other prognostic factors."

A high incidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) during combination treatment with osimertinib and anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor has been reported. The current study presents a case of ILD development during osimertinib treatment following nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) treatment. The 59-year-old female was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma harboring a deletion in exon 19 of the EGFR gene. Following nivolumab as a sixth-line treatment, an EGFR-T790M-encoding mutation in EGFR exon 20 was identified by re-biopsy. Osimertinib was therefore initiated as a seventh-line treatment. A partial response was subsequently noted; however, 63 days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented with dyspnea with decreased oxygenation in the absence of fever and sputum. A computed tomography scan revealed the emergence of ground-glass opacities with bronchiectasis in both lungs, and a diagnosis of ILD due to osimertinib was made. Following steroid pulse therapy with discontinuation of osimertinib, the patient's chest findings and respiratory condition improved. Therefore, it is considered that anti-PD-1 therapies may be associated with a risk of ILD during subsequent osimertinib treatment."

However, the role of SNPs at the 3'‑UTR of B7‑H1 in the susceptibility of non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, SNPs with a minor allele frequency >10%, which  were located at the microRNA complementary site in the PD‑L1 3'‑UTR, were selected via bioinformatic prediction using Ensembl and miRanda 2010. A total of  three SNPs were selected, s2297136, rs4143815 and rs4742098, in the 3'‑UTR of B7‑H1. The rs2297136 and rs4742098 SNPs exhibited significant differences between 320 patients with NSCLC and 199 healthy individuals, respectively (P<0.001 and P=0.007). For the rs2297136 SNP, the AG genotype was significantly associated with evaluation of the risk of NSCLC, compared the AA genotype [odds ratio (OR)=2.287; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.558‑3.358]. Similarly, for the rs4742098 SNP, the AG genotype differed from the AA genotype on eva-luation of the risk of NSCLC (OR=1.599; 95% CI=1.027‑2.488). Dual‑luciferase reporter assays showed that rs2297136 and rs4742098 in the B7‑H1 3'‑UTR contributed to the occurrence of NSCLC through disrupting the interaction between miR‑296‑5p, miR‑138 and B7‑H1 mRNA. These results indicated that genetic polymorphisms affecting the expression of B7‑H1 modified cancer susceptibility."

A great challenge in treating NSCLC is the discovery of advanced, molecular tools to diagnose the disease in early stages as well as the development of immunotherapy. MicroRNAs are regulatory molecules (~20 nt in length) with the ability to regulate the expression of genes. The recently described PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules have great importance for potential use in immunotherapy of many cancers. These molecules are associated with immune checkpoints and provide an opportunity for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients with synthetic monoclonal antibodies. PD-L1 expression is strictly associated with microRNA function in lung cancer cells. The group of microRNAs related to PD-L1 includes, among others, miR-200, miR-197 or miRNA-34. Expression of these molecules may be useful in lung cancer diagnosis, qualification to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy and could be a potential therapeutic target. However, studies on PD-L1-related microRNAs are necessary to develop advanced targeted molecular therapies."

These findings have led to the changing of the current therapeutic algorithm of advanced NSCLC, adding a new standard first-line treatment option for patients with PD-L1-positive tumors. Pembrolizumab, a highly selective anti-PD-1 humanized monoclonal antibody, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in October 2016 for previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression, tumor proportion score (TPS) ⩾  50%, as well as for metastatic NSCLC patients whose tumors express PD-L1 with TPS ⩾ 1% progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. However, many issues remain outstanding, mainly regarding the identification of an optimal biomarker which can help selecting patients more likely to respond to ICPIs. In this review, we discuss the clinical results obtained so far with the anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab in advanced NSCLC, commenting on the role of PD-L1 as a predictive  factor and providing an update of the future perspectives."

Materials and methods: Phase III randomised clinical trials (RCTs) were identified after systematic review of databases and conference proceedings. A random-effect model was used to determine the pooled HR for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response. The pooled OR for overall response and treatment-related side effects were calculated using the inverse-variance method. Heterogeneity was measured using the τ2 and I2 statistics. Results: After the systematic review, we included four phase III RCTs (n=2737) in this meta-analysis. The use of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 agents (atezolizumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab) was associated with better OS in comparison with docetaxel alone (HR: 0.69; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.75; p<0.00001).

The overall response rate was also higher for patients who received any anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1  therapy in comparison with docetaxel (OR: 1.77; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.50; p=0.001). Regarding treatment-related side effects grade 3 or higher, patients who received immunotherapy experienced less events than patients allocated to docetaxel (OR: 0.19; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.30; p<0.00001). The use of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy in patients with progressive  advanced NSCLC is significantly better than the use of docetaxel in terms of OS,  PFS, duration of response and overall response rate."

The clinical behavior of NEN is highly unpredictable; in fact, low-grade cases can unexpectedly be associated with metastases. Currently, the 2010 WHO NEN classification employs histological differentiation and the proliferation index for grading tumors but fails to provide reliable prognostic and therapeutic indications. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a better characterization of  G2/G3 NENs. Similar to several other tumors, NENs possess immune-escape mechanisms, but very little has yet been done to characterize this crucial aspect. There are no available data describing PD-L1 expression in these tumors.  Here we provide, for the first time, evidence of PD-L1 tissue expression in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs). PD-L1 expression was  significantly associated with a high-grade WHO classification (G3) (P<0.001) but  not with gender, primary site, or lymph node status. The PD-L1 positivity rate and signal intensity are directly correlated (P<0.001) with a grade increase from G1 to G3. In particular in G3 cases, we observed a dichotomy between the morphology (WD- and PD-NENs) and Ki67. Moreover, our study demonstrated a significant association with the grade and PD-L1 expression levels in immune-infiltrating cells (P<0.001). In particular, G3 tumors are characterized by strong PD-L1 expression in both the tumor and infiltrating immune cells (P<0.001), reflecting an unfavorable environment for T-cell-mediated tumor aggression. These findings suggest that NENs might acquire resistance to immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 and inhibiting peritumoral and intratumoral infiltrating lymphocytes. Here we demonstrate that PD-L1 is currently the best-known biomarker for G3 NENs, becoming the new gold standard for G3 NEN discrimination. Furthermore, pharmacological approaches using anti-PD-1 antibodies may become the logical choice for the treatment of G3 cases with a poor prognosis."

The mRNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of 14 solid cancer types representing 6,685 tumor samples was analyzed. TMIT was classified only for those tumor types that both PD-L1 and CD8A/CYT could prefict mutation and/or neoantigen number. The mutational and neoepitope features of the tumor were compared according to the four TMITs. We found that PD-L1/CD8A/CYT subgroups could not distinguish different mutation and neoantigen numbers in certain tumor  types such as glioblastoma multiforme, prostate adenocarcinoma, and head and neck and lung squamous cell carcinoma. For the remaining tumor types, compared with TIMT II (low PD-L1 and CD8A/CYT), TIMT I (high PD-L1 and CD8A/CYT) had a significantly higher number of mutations or neoantigens in bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast and cervical cancer, colorectal, stomach and lung adenocarcinoma, and melanoma. In contrast, TMIT I of kidney clear cell, liver hepatocellular, and thyroid carcinoma were negatively correlated with mutation burden or neoantigen numbers. Our findings show that the TMIT stratification proposed could serve as a favorable approach for tailoring optimal immunotherapeutic strategies in certain tumor types. Going forward, it will be important to test the clinical practicability of TMIT based on quantification of  immune infiltrates using mRNA-seq to predict clinical response to these and other immunotherapeutic strategies in more different tumors."

Patients with an aggressive tumor phenotype should be excluded from PM, since its benefit is outweighed by early tumor recurrence and impaired prognosis. Expression of PD-1 and its ligands are prognostic factors in a variety of primary tumors. However, their impact on patients' outcome in the setting of PM for CRC has not been evaluated before. 53  CRC patients with pulmonary metastases receiving PM with curative intent were included in this study. Tissue samples of resected pulmonary metastases and available corresponding primary tumors were collected and assessed for PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor cells. Expression patterns were correlated with clinical outcome parameters. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression was commonly found in TILs and tumor cells. Expression levels significantly differed between metastases and primary tumors. High PD-1 expression by TILs was associated with impaired overall survival (low vs high expression (mean, 95% CI): 78 mo (60-96) vs 35 mo (25-44); p = 0.011). Additionally, the subgroup of patients, who experienced an upgrading in their TILs/PD1 status between primary and metastasis had a worse survival outcome compared with patients with the same grade or a downgrading (34 mo (26-42) vs 96 mo (72-120); p = 0.004). Thus, PD-1 expression by TILs is a strong prognostic  marker in CRC patients with pulmonary spreading treated by PM. Moreover, this study provides a rationale for a therapeutic PD-1 pathway blockade in the treatment of CRC lung metastases. Future, large-scale studies are warranted to validate the findings of this single-center, retrospective analysis."

It is known that PD-L1  is frequently up-regulated in a number of different cancers and the relevance of  this pathway has been extensively studied and therapeutic approaches targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 have been developed. We used a non-invasive, real-time biopsy for  determining PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in CETCs of solid cancer patients. CETCs were determined from blood of 128 patients suffering from breast (72), prostate (27), colorectal (18) and lung (11) cancer. The number of vital CETCs and the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were investigated using the maintrac® method. PD-L1 expressing CETCs were detected in 94.5% of breast, 100% of prostate, 95.4% of colorectal and 82% of lung cancer patients whereas only 75% of breast cancer patients had PD-L2 positive CETCs. In the PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressing patients the cell fraction of PD-L1 positive CETCs is significantly higher than the fraction of PD-L2 positive CETCs (54.6% vs. 28.7%; p<0.001). Breast cancer patients with metastatic disease had significantly more PD-L1 positive CETCs as compared to patients without metastasis (median 75% vs. 61.1%;  p<0.05). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 seems to be a major factor in immune evasion and is highly expressed on CETCs regardless of the type of cancer. Monitoring the frequency of  PD-L1 positive CETCs could reflect individual patient's response for an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and may be a promising target of anticancer treatment."

The training was  found to have no or very little impact on intra- or interobserver reproducibility.Pathologists reported good reproducibility at both 1% and 50% cut points. More adapted training could potentially increase reliability, in particular for samples with PD-L1 proportion, scores around 50%."

Here, we studied PD-L1 expression and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in surgically resectable NSCLC and correlate the  finding with clinicopathological features and patient outcomes. Total of 170 archival samples of resectable NSCLC were probed for PD-L1 expression using the clone 22C3 pharmDx kit. The PD-L1 expression was determined by the Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) and classified into TPS <1%, TPS 1 to 49% and TPS ≥50%. The scoring of TILs was from hematoxylin & eosin stained tissue sections using a  system for standardized evaluation of TILs in breast cancer. PD-L1 expression was compared with clinical pathological characteristics and survival outcome. Expression of PD-L1 scores of TPS ≥50%, TPS 1 to 49% and TPS <1% were observed in 10.6%, 24.7% and 64.7% of the 170 archival samples, respectively. Positive PD-L1  expression was significantly higher in patients with squamous carcinoma, in those with higher TNM stage and with the presence of TILs. Neither the PD-L1 expression, TIL status, nor their combination was an independent prognosis biomarker of survival when the data was subjected to either univariate or multivariate analysis.

Susceptibilities of cisplatin-resistant  A549CisR and H157CisR cells vs. parental cells to the cytotoxic action of NK cells were examined. We found cisplatin-resistant cells more resistant to NK cell cytotoxicity than parental cells. There were constitutively higher expressions of PD-L1 in A549CisR and H157CisR cells than in parental cells in vitro, as well as  in H157CisR cell-derived tumors than H157P cell-derived tumors. In contrast, we observed that the expression of PD-1 in NK cells was induced after co-culture with cisplatin-resistant cells. We also observed increased susceptibility of cisplatin-resistant cells to NK cell cytotoxicity when neutralizing antibody of PD-1 or PD-L1 was added. Further, we found that the NK group 2, member D (NKG2D)  ligand levels were lower in A549CisR and H157CisR cells than in parental cells. Meanwhile, we discovered that the MEK/Erk signaling pathway played a significant  role in this regulation, and the addition of a MEK/Erk pathway inhibitor significantly enhanced the PD-L1 Ab effect in enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity to cisplatin-resistant cells."

However, considering the costs of these drugs and the fact that only a subset of patients experience long-term disease control, the identification of predictive biomarkers for the selection of candidates suitable for treatment has become a priority. The research focused mainly on the expression of the PD-L1 receptor on both tumor cells and/or immune infiltrates determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, different checkpoint inhibitors were tested, different IHC assays were used, different targets were considered (tumor cells, immune infiltrates or both) and different expression thresholds were employed in clinical trials. In some trials the assay was used prospectively to select the patients, while in other trials it was evaluated retrospectively. Some confusion emerges, which makes it difficult to easily compare the literature data and to translate them in practice management. This mini-review shows the possibilities and pitfalls of the PD-L1 expression to predict the activity and efficacy of anti PD1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of NSCLC."

There were 4 patients with lung metastasis, 1 with portal vein tumor thrombus, 1 with abdominal metastasis and 1  with bone metastasis. The protocol was nivolumab, 3 mg/kg, on day 1, q3w. All patients were treated for more than 4 cycles. During anti-PD1 treatment period, 6 patients also received sorafenib and 1 patient received cytokine-induced killer cell therapy. Objective response and clinical adverse events were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Patients underwent a total of 80 cycles of nivolumab therapy, ranging between 4 and 18 cycles per patient. Nivolumab was associated with a disease control rate of 81.8%, with an objective response of 63.6% (Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). No adverse effects related to nivolumab were noted.

The presence of CD8 T cells in the tumor correlates with improved survival. We show that immuno-positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) can visualize tumors by detecting infiltrating lymphocytes and, through longitudinal  observation of individual animals, distinguish responding tumors from those that  do not respond to therapy. We used 89Zr-labeled PEGylated single-domain antibody  fragments (VHHs) specific for CD8 to track the presence of intratumoral CD8+ T cells in the immunotherapy-susceptible B16 melanoma model in response to checkpoint blockade. A 89Zr-labeled PEGylated anti-CD8 VHH detected thymus and secondary lymphoid structures as well as intratumoral CD8 T cells. Animals that responded to CTLA-4 therapy showed a homogeneous distribution of the anti-CD8 PET signal throughout the tumor, whereas more heterogeneous infiltration of CD8 T cells correlated with faster tumor growth and worse responses. To support the validity of these observations, we used two different transplantable breast cancer models, yielding results that conformed with predictions based on the antimelanoma response. It may thus be possible to use immuno-PET and monitor antitumor immune responses as a prognostic tool to predict patient responses to checkpoint therapies."

Even though pemetrexed has shown huge potential in combination with other  targeted or immune therapies, there is still little information about the values  of specific immune checkpoint markers for advanced lung adenocarcinoma treated with pemetrexed. In the present study, a total of 56 patients with advanced lung  adenocarcinoma, who received pemetrexed-based chemotherapy, were included retrospectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess PD-L1, programmed death 1 (PD-1), thymidylate synthase, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  In this cohort, the positive expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 were 26.8% and 33.9% respectively. PD-L1, PD-1, and thymidylate synthase expression were not significantly associated with any clinical features, while the expression of both PD-L1 and PD-1 were correlated with Ki-67 expression. Furthermore, the expression of PD-1 was significantly correlated with TILs. The progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with PD-L1+ specimens was significantly longer compared to PD-L1- specimens. Moreover, PD-L1 expression was an independent protective factor for PFS, and the smoking status was an independent risk factor. PD-L1 expression  was significantly associated with better prognosis for patients with pemetrexed-based treatment. Our findings suggested that PD-L1 expression might be a favorable prognostic biomarker for pemetrexed-based regimen, which is a rationale for combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy for lung cancer."

Blockade of the receptor (PD-1) can avert this evasion. Here we aim at investigating PD-L1 expression in erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells with MET proto-oncogene (MET) gene amplification. We employed an erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cell line with MET gene amplification. PD-L1 mRNA (qPCR) and protein (flow cytometry) expression was investigated after treatment with MET and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) targeting drugs (crizotinib and SCH772984, respectively). We demonstrate that PD-L1 expression is increased in erlotinib-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with MET gene amplification. Targeted inhibition of MET significantly decreases both gene and protein expression of PD-L1. Further, we demonstrate that inhibiting MAPK also results in a significant decrease in PD-L1 expression. Taken together these results show that expression of PD-L1 in the erlotinib-resistant cell line is associated with MET activity, and the downstream MAPK pathway. Our results demonstrate that PD-L1 expression is increased in erlotinib resistant NSCLC cells with MET gene amplification and that the increase can be averted by targeted inhibition of MET."

The most success has been achieved with the class of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), antibodies that unleash the antitumor immune response. After the success in melanoma, numerous clinical trials are being conducted investigating CPIs in lung cancer and mesothelioma. The programmed death protein  (PD) 1-PD ligand 1/2 pathway and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 are  currently the most studied immunotherapeutic targets in these malignancies. In non-small cell lung cancer, anti-PD-1 antibodies have become part of the approved treatment arsenal. In small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma, the efficacy of checkpoint inhibition has not yet been proven. In this Concise Clinical Review, an overview of the landmark clinical trials investigating checkpoint blockade in  lung cancer and mesothelioma is provided. Because response rates are around 20% in the majority of clinical trials, there is much room for improvement. Predictive biomarkers are therefore essential to fully develop the potential of CPIs. To increase efficacy, multiple clinical trials investigating the combination of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitors and PD-1/PD ligand 1 blockade in lung cancer and mesothelioma are being conducted. Given the  potential benefit of immunotherapy, implementation of current and new knowledge in trial designs and interpretation of results is essential for moving forward."

One recent advance that holds great promise is immunotherapy-an approach that enhances a patient's immune system to better recognize and react to abnormal cells. The most successful immunotherapeutic strategy to date uses antibodies to block inhibitory receptors (also called checkpoints) that are up-regulated on the T cells that infiltrate the tumor. Two examples of such molecules are programmed cell death-1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4. With more than a dozen clinical trials in non-small-cell lung cancer completed, checkpoint blockade targeting PD1 has demonstrated durable responses and superior survival compared with traditional chemotherapy agents when used as  first-line therapy in individuals with more than 50% PD1 ligand (PDL1) expression by immunohistochemical staining and as second-line therapy independent of PDL1 status. Antibodies to PDL1 have shown similar activity. Combinations of anti-PD1  and anti-PDL1 with anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 and chemotherapy are being actively tested. These agents have generally tolerable safety profiles; pneumonitis, although rare, remains the most feared adverse effect. PDL1 expression on tumors has been identified as a biomarker predictive of response. Although PDL1 expression has traditionally been measured on resected tumor specimens, the pulmonologist has a growing role in obtaining samples for testing via minimally invasive means."

We evaluated changes in serum IL-8 levels as a biomarker of response to anti-PD-1 blockade in melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Patients and methods: Metastatic melanoma and NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab alone or nivolumab plus ipilimumab were studied. Serum was collected at baseline; at 2-4 weeks after the first dose; and at the time-points of response evaluation. Serum IL-8 levels were determined by sandwich ELISA. Changes in serum IL-8 levels were compared with the Wilcoxon test and their strength of association with response was assessed with the Mann-Whitney test. Accuracy of changes in IL-8 levels to predict response was estimated using  receiver operation characteristics curves. Results: Twenty-nine melanoma patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab were studied. In responding patients, serum IL-8 levels significantly decreased between baseline and best response (P <0.001), and significantly increased upon progression (P =  0.004). In non-responders, IL-8 levels significantly increased  between baseline and progression (P =  0.013). Early changes in serum IL-8 levels (2-4 weeks after treatment initiation) were strongly associated with response (P <0.001). These observations were validated in 19 NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab (P =  0.001), and in 15 melanoma patients treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (P <0.001). Early decreases in serum IL-8 levels were associated with longer overall survival in melanoma (P =  0.001) and NSCLC (P =  0.015) patients. Serum IL-8 levels also correctly reflected true response in three cancer patients presenting pseudoprogression.

Changes of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels during therapy could be a promising tool for very accurate monitoring of treatment efficacy, but data are lacking with ICB. Patients and methods: This prospective pilot study was conducted in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer, uveal melanoma, or microsatellite-instable colorectal  cancer treated by nivolumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy at Institut Curie. ctDNA levels were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks (w8) by bidirectional pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization, droplet digital PCR or next-generation sequencing depending on the mutation type. Radiological evaluation of efficacy of treatment was carried out by using immune-related response criteria. Results: ctDNA was detected at baseline in 10 out of 15 patients. At w8, a significant correlation (r = 0.86; P = 0.002) was observed between synchronous changes in ctDNA levels and tumor size. Patients in whom ctDNA levels became undetectable at w8 presented a marked and lasting response to therapy. ctDNA detection at w8 was also a significant prognostic factor in terms of progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 10.2; 95% confidence interval 2.5-41, P < 0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 15; 95% confidence interval 2.5-94.9, P = 0.004).

We hypothesized that cytologic cell block material is suitable for PD-L1 analysis. Eighty-six paired samples of malignancies from the lung where cytologic cell block and histologic material were available from the same lesion were stained with PD-L1 IHC 28-8pharmDx and PD-L1 IHC 22C3pharmDx. Scorings of like material (cytology or histology) stained with different assays were analyzed in order to evaluate the analytical agreement between assays. Scoring of different materials stained with like assays were analyzed in order to evaluate the agreement between cytology and histology. A high degree of agreement was found between 28-8pharmDx and 22C3pharmDx, whether applied to histologic or cytologic cell blocks, with Pearson R of 0.95. The Pearson R between 2 rounds of assessment of the same assay on the  same type of material was also 0.95. The agreement between histologic and cytologic specimens was high with Pearson R 0.87 to 0.89 and overall agreement between 85% and 95%. There was no bias toward lower prevalence of positivity with cytology than with histology. Disagreement was related to heterogeneity of the histologic tumor sample. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 assessment is feasible on cytologic material with the tested assays using cutoffs for positivity similar to those used on histologic material."

However, they are often associated with potentially fatal immune-mediated pneumonitis. Preliminary reports of trials suggest a difference in the rate of pneumonitis with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. We sought to determine the overall incidence of pneumonitis and differences according to type of inhibitors and prior chemotherapy use.

Rates of pneumonitis of any grade and grade ≥ 3 from all clinical trials investigating nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab as single agents in NSCLC were collected. The incidence of pneumonitis across trials was calculated using DerSimonian-Laird random effects models. We compared incidences between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and between treatment naive and previously treated patients. Nineteen trials (12 with PD-1 inhibitors [n = 3,232] and 7 with PD-L1 inhibitors [n = 1,806]) were identified. PD-1 inhibitors were found to have statistically significant higher incidence of any grade pneumonitis compared with PD-L1 inhibitors (3.6%; 95% CI, 2.4%-4.9% vs 1.3%; 95% CI, 0.8%-1.9%, respectively; P = .001).

PD-L1 expression has been most widely  studied, and is more predictive in NSCLC than renal cell carcinoma or melanoma. We therefore studied differences in expression patterns across tumor types.Experimental Design: We used tissue microarrays with tumors from NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, or melanoma and a panel of cell lines to study differences  between tumor types. Predictive studies were conducted on samples from 65 melanoma patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors alone or with CTLA-4 inhibitors, characterized for outcome. PD-L1 expression was studied by quantitative immunofluorescence using two well-validated antibodies.Results: PD-L1 expression  was higher in NSCLC specimens than renal cell carcinoma, and lowest in melanoma (P = 0.001), and this finding was confirmed in a panel of cell lines. In melanoma tumors, PD-L1 was expressed either on tumor cells or immune-infiltrating cells. The association between PD-L1 expression in immune-infiltrating cells and progression-free or overall-survival in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab was stronger than PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, and remained significant on multivariable analysis.PD-L1 expression in melanoma tumor cells is lower than NSCLC or renal cell carcinoma cells. The higher response rate in melanoma patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors is likely related to PD-L1 in tumor-associated inflammatory cells. Further studies are warranted to validate the predictive role of inflammatory cell PD-L1 expression in melanoma and determine its biological significance."

Patients and Measurements: We studied 93 patients with advanced cancer (ages 24 to 82 years; 60% males) who received at least one infusion of pembrolizumab. Thyroid test results and thyroid imaging modalities were reviewed. Comprehensive  10-color flow cytometry of peripheral blood was performed. Results: Thirteen (14%) thyroid irAEs were observed. Thyroiditis occurred in seven patients (54%), from which four recovered. New onset of hypothyroidism overt/subclinical developed in three patients. Levothyroxine dosing required doubling in three patients with a known history of hypothyroidism. Thyroperoxidase antibodies were positive in the minority of the patients [4/13 (31%)] and diffuse increased 18fludeoxyglucose uptake of the thyroid gland was observed in the majority [7/11 (64%)] of patients. We observed more circulating CD56+CD16+ natural killer (NK) cells and an elevated HLA-DR surface expression in the inflammatory intermediate CD14+CD16+ monocytes in anti-PD-1-treated patients. Thyroid dysfunction is common in cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab. Reversible destructive thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism are the most common clinical presentations. The mechanism of thyroid destruction appears independent of thyroid autoantibodies and may include T cell, NK cell, and/or monocyte-mediated pathways. Because the thyroid is a frequent target of anti-PD-1 therapies, patients with therapeutically refractory thyroid cancer may  be ideal candidates for this treatment."

Recent studies suggest  that IFN-γ is a critical driver of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression in cancer and host cells, and baseline intratumoral T cell infiltration may improve response likelihood to anti-PD-1 therapies, including pembrolizumab. However, whether quantifying T cell-inflamed microenvironment is a useful pan-tumor determinant of PD-1-directed therapy response has not been rigorously evaluated. Here, we analyzed gene expression profiles (GEPs) using RNA from baseline tumor samples of pembrolizumab-treated patients. We identified immune-related signatures correlating with clinical benefit using a learn-and-confirm paradigm based on data from different clinical studies of pembrolizumab, starting with a small pilot of 19 melanoma patients and eventually defining a pan-tumor T cell-inflamed GEP in 220 patients with 9 cancers. Predictive value was independently confirmed and compared with that of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in 96 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The T cell-inflamed GEP contained IFN-γ-responsive genes related to antigen presentation, chemokine expression, cytotoxic activity, and adaptive immune resistance, and these features were necessary, but not always sufficient, for clinical benefit. The T cell-inflamed GEP has been developed into a clinical-grade assay that is currently being evaluated in ongoing pembrolizumab trials."

Although studies  have examined the association between lung cancer driver gene mutations or expression and PD-L1 expression, the present studies have not been mined the correlation systematically and genome-widely. All relevant published PD-L1 articles with driver genes data and the RNA-seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. We performed meta-analysis for data included in the selected literature, and then independently explored the correlation between genes by co-expression analysis of RNA-seq data in the TCGA database. A sum of 9,934 lung cancer cases were collected from 34 published studies. Higher PD-L1 expression was associated with wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [odds ratio (OR): 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48-0.96, P=0.03], Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.58, P=0.03) or non-adenocarcinoma histology (OR: 0.68,  95% CI: 0.47-0.98, P=0.04). In addition, our analysis from TCGA data indicated that, compared with lung adenocarcinoma, the expression of PD-L1 was significantly higher than that of squamous cell carcinoma patients (P=0.023). The expression of targetable driver genes showed no correlations with PD-L1 expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our results suggest the presence of EGFR wild-type, KRAS gene mutations or squamous cell carcinoma were associated with high PD-L1expression, which provides potential benefited population for the administration of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in human lung cancer."

We hypothesized that IL-17A promotes a  protumorigenic inflammatory phenotype and inhibits antitumor immune responses. We generated bitransgenic mice expressing a conditional IL-17A allele along with conditional KrasG12D and performed immune phenotyping of mouse lungs,  a survival analysis, and treatment studies with antibodies either blocking programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or IL-6 or depleting neutrophils. To support the preclinical findings, we analyzed human gene expression data sets and immune profiled patient lung tumors. Tumors in IL-17:KrasG12D mice grew more rapidly, resulting in a significantly shorter survival as compared with that of KrasG12D mice. IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein, and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 were increased in the lungs of IL17:Kras mice. Time course analysis revealed that levels of tumor-associated neutrophils were significantly increased, and lymphocyte recruitment was significantly reduced in IL17:KrasG12D mice as compared with in KrasG12D mice. In therapeutic studies PD-1 blockade was not effective in treating IL-17:KrasG12D tumors. In contrast, blocking IL-6 or depleting neutrophils with an anti-Ly-6G antibody in the IL17:KrasG12D tumors resulted in a clinical response associated with T-cell activation. In tumors from patients with lung cancer with KRAS mutation we found a correlation between higher levels of IL-17A and colony- stimulating factor 3 and a significant correlation among high neutrophil and lower T-cell numbers. Here we have shown that an increase in a single cytokine, IL-17A, without additional mutations can promote lung cancer growth by promoting inflammation, which contributes to resistance to PD-1 blockade and sensitizes tumors to cytokine and neutrophil depletion."

To evaluate MMR status, we analyzed the microsatellite instability (MSI) of lung adenocarcinomas. Frozen tissues of lung adenocarcinoma and corresponding normal lung were obtained from 341 patients, including 141 with tumors harboring  driver gene alterations (50 EGFR gene mutations, 50 KRAS gene mutations, 21 ALK fusions, 10 ROS1 fusions, and 10 RET fusions) and 200 with pan-negative tumors (100 never- or light-smokers and 100 heavy-smokers), who were surgically treated  between 2007 and 2015. Genomic DNA extracted from tumors and corresponding normal lung tissues were used for MSI analysis using the Promega panel (5 mononucleotide markers: BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, and MONO-27; and 2 pentanucleotide markers: Penta C and Penta D). MSI was identified in only 1 pan-negative tumor from a 64-year-old male  heavy smoker. MSI was found in 4 mononucleotide markers. Although no clinical background of Lynch syndrome was evident, somatic MLH1 gene mutation was identified. MLH1 was expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and was not expressed in cancer cells. PD-L1 was not expressed in cancer cells, and PD-1 was  not expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: MSI is a rare event in lung adenocarcinoma regardless of smoking status and mutation status of driver oncogenes. Accordingly, MMR deficiency status cannot be used as a biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for lung adenocarcinoma."

Six months before the emergence of pneumonitis, the patient had discontinued treatment with nivolumab because of acute hepatitis. Information on  pneumonitis after nivolumab discontinuation in the literature is scarce, whereas  most of the cases emerge during the first 2.5 months of treatment. Patients with  multiple immune-related AEs comprise a group of special interest as the identification of factors affecting the susceptibility of patients to immune-related AEs of PD-1 inhibitors may lead to a more rational use of these drugs.

We performed transcriptomic profiling of tumor-infiltrating CTLs from treatment-naive patients with lung cancer to define the molecular features associated with the robustness of anti-tumor immune responses. We observed considerable heterogeneity in the expression of molecules associated with activation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and of immunological-checkpoint molecules such as 4-1BB, PD-1 and TIM-3. Tumors with a high density of CTLs showed enrichment for transcripts linked to tissue-resident memory cells (TRM cells), such as CD103, and CTLs from CD103hi tumors displayed features of enhanced cytotoxicity. A greater density of TRM cells in tumors was predictive of a better survival outcome in lung cancer, and this effect was independent of that conferred by CTL density. Here we define the 'molecular fingerprint' of tumor-infiltrating CTLs and identify potentially new targets for immunotherapy."

Considering the promising results with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, evaluating the status of immune cell (IC) infiltrates in the prognosis of brain metastasis may lead to better therapeutic strategies with these agents. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution of ICs and determine the expression of the checkpoint molecules programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1, in brain metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients and to analyze their clinicopathological correlations. Methods: We determined the presence of peritumoral mononuclear cells (mononuclear ring) and the density of intratumoral stromal mononuclear cells on brain metastasis tissue sections of 208 LUAD patients. PD-L1/PD-1 expressions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Mononuclear rings were significantly associated with better survival after brain metastasis surgery. Cases with massive stromal IC infiltration also showed a tendency for better overall survival. Lower expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was associated with better survival in patients who underwent surgery for the primary tumor and had multiple brain metastases. Steroid administration and chemotherapy appear not to influence the density of IC in brain metastasis. This is the first study demonstrating the independent prognostic value of mononuclear rings in LUAD cases with brain metastasis. Our results also  suggest that the density of tumor-associated ICs in addition to PD-L1 expression  of tumor cells and ICs as well as PD-1 expression of ICs may hold relevant information for the appropriate selection of patients who might benefit from anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 therapy."

Last year, the Unites States Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anti-PD-1 inhibitors for treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma and recently expanded the use of immunotherapy for  metastatic urothelial cell carcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. However, studies on expression of PD-1 and its ligand in malignant bone and soft tissue sarcoma are sparse. In this study, we evaluated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on variants of liposarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) for liposarcomas (well differentiated, myxoid/round cell, and  pleomorphic), rhabdomyosarcomas (alveolar, embryonal, pleomorphic, and spindle cell), conventional osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas were stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies. Adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, bone, osteochondroma and lipoma were used as control and benign counterparts. Western blot was performed to evaluate expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in four sarcoma cell lines. Osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, and all variants of liposarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas over-expressed PD-1 relative to normal tissue. Expression of PD-1 in rhabdomyosarcomas was associated with higher tumour stage. Only one case  of pleomorphic liposarcoma, one case of pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma and two cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas were positive for PD-L1. Normal adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone were negative for both PD-1 and PD-L1 and lipomas and osteochondroma weakly expressed PD-1 but not PD-L1. Western blot confirmed the presence of PD-1 protein in all four sarcoma cell lines. Overall, our results showed cytoplasmic expression of PD-1 in the bone and soft tissue sarcomas, while PD-L1 was negative. Whether these data are an indication for effectiveness of immunotherapy in the management of malignant bone and soft tissue sarcomas remains to be elucidated."

In addition, the  prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression in advanced NSCLC was also investigated. 5 eligible studies including 3579 patients were identified through  comprehensive search of multiple databases. The results showed that pooled hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were 0.69 (95% CI: 0.63-0.75; p < 0.001) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80-0.94; p < 0.001), between PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and docetaxel treatment arms, respectively. The pooled relative risk (RR) value for objective response rate (ORR) was 1.53, (95%  CI: 1.16-2.01, p = 0.003). Further, subgroup analysis based on PD-L1 expression indicated that pooled HR for OS was significant with 0.66(95% CI: 0.59-0.74, p <  0.001) for PD-L1≥1%.

We performed an integrated analysis of PD-ligand 1(PD-L1)/CD8 expression and mutation profile based on the repository database and resected early-stage NSCLC in Guangdong Lung Cancer Institute (GLCI). Meanwhile, 2 pool-analyses were set to clarify the correlation between EGFR mutation and PD-L1 expression, and the association of EGFR status with response to anti-PD-1/L1 therapy. Pool-analysis of 15 public studies suggested that patients with EGFR mutations had decreased PD-L1 expression (odds ratio: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.10-2.93; P  = 0.02). Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the GCLI cohort confirmed the inverse correlation between EGFR mutation and PD-L1 expression. Furthermore,  patients with EGFR mutation showed a lack of T-cell infiltration and shrinking proportion of PD-L1+/CD8+ TIL (P = 0.034). Importantly, patients with EGFR mutations, especially the sensitive subtype, showed a significantly decreased mutation burden, based on analysis of the discovery and validation sets. Finally, a pool-analysis of 4 randomized control trials confirmed that patients with EGFR  mutation did not benefit from PD-1/L1 inhibitors (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.09, P = 0.51) while patients with EGFR wild-type did (HR = 0.73, P < 0.00001).

However, immune interstitial nephritis has been described in a patient treated by nivolumab and ipilimumab concomitantly, and three cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis have been reported with ipilimumab monotherapy. We report herein a case of acute  interstitial immune nephritis in a patient treated with nivolumab after ipilimumab for pulmonary metastatic melanoma. CASE PRESENTATION: Interstitial nephritis was diagnosed after acute kidney injury following three cycles and was confirmed by kidney biopsy. Kidney injury responded rapidly to prednisolone, which was then gradually reduced. As a follow-up computed tomography scan indicated mixed response, with minimal size progression of a pulmonary nodule, but a significant reduction in the size of the other nodules, nivolumab was reintroduced after renal function improvement. Low-dose corticosteroids were first maintained during nivolumab treatment and subsequently discontinued. Only one month after prednisolone discontinuation, creatinine levels increased. A second kidney biopsy confirmed relapse of acute interstitial nephritis. To our knowledge, this is the first case of nivolumab-induced acute  interstitial immune nephritis. This case highlights that anti-PD-1 immunotherapy  may be continued when renal function is adequate, and this requires close interaction between dermatologists and nephrologists. This adverse effect should  be made known to prescribers as nivolumab is associated with significant improvement of survival in metastatic melanoma and may be used in many different  types of cancer."

In the present study, we have evaluated a heterologous prime boost regime based on the simian adenovirus ChAdOx1 and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing 5T4 for immunogenicity and tumour protective efficacy in a mouse cancer model. Vaccination-induced immune responses were strong, durable and attributable primarily to CD8+ T cells. By comparison, homologous MVA vaccination regimen did not induce detectable 5T4-specific T cell responses. ChAdOx1-MVA vaccinated mice were completely protected against subsequent B16 melanoma challenge, but in therapeutic settings this regime was only modestly effective in delaying tumour outgrowth. Concomitant delivery of the vaccine with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting immune checkpoint regulators LAG-3, PD-1 or PD-L1 demonstrated that the combination of vaccine with anti PD-1 mAb could significantly delay tumour growth and increase overall survival of tumour-bearing mice.

A laboratory is  unlikely to use multiple assay platforms. Furthermore, commercially available diagnostic assays are not standardized, and different assay methods could lead to inappropriate treatment selection. This study establishes the extent of concordance between three validated, commercially available PD-L1 IHC diagnostic  assays for NSCLC patients [Ventana SP263 (durvalumab), Dako 22C3 (pembrolizumab), and Dako 28-8 (nivolumab)].Experimental Design: Five hundred formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival NSCLC samples were obtained from commercial sources. Stained slides were read in batches on an assay-by-assay basis by a single pathologist trained in all methods, in a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments program-certified laboratory. An additional pathologist performed an independent review of 200 stained samples for each assay.Results: PD-L1 expression was evaluable with all assays in 493 samples. The three assays showed  similar patterns of tumor membrane staining, with high correlation between percent PD-L1 staining. An overall percentage agreement of >90% was achieved between assays at multiple expression cutoffs, including 1%, 10%, 25%, and 50% tumor membrane staining.This study builds optimism that harmonization between assays may be possible, and that the three assays studied could potentially be used interchangeably to identify patients most likely to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies, provided the appropriate clinically defined algorithm and agent are always linked."

Lung cancer has been in the forefront of checkpoint inhibition for the past 2 years and has paved the path for other subspecialties. While PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab have  been approved for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), this review focuses on atezolizumab, its landmark studies, and ongoing trials. Atezolizumab is the first programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor to receive US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for metastatic NSCLC patients who have progressed on frontline chemotherapy. This approval was based on two open-label Phase II multicenter trials, POPLAR (NCT01903993) and BIRCH (NCT02031458). Both studies revealed a benefit in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and response rate in the atezolizumab arm when compared to single-agent docetaxol. There were also fewest Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in the  atezolizumab cohort. The open-label randomized Phase III OAK trial (NCT02008227)  further established the role of atezolizumab in previously treated NSCLC. This study compared atezolizumab with docetaxel in patients with advanced NSCLC (squamous or nonsquamous histologies) who had progressed on one to two prior chemotherapy regimens. OS in the PD-L1-enriched population was superior in the atezolizumab arm (n=241) at 15.7 months compared with docetaxel (n=222) at 10.3 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.93; p=0.0102). Patients lacking PD-L1 also had survival benefit with atezolizumab with a median OS (mOS) of 12.6 months versus 8.9 months with chemotherapy (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96). Benefit was noted in both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC subsets and regardless of PD-L1 expressivity. As seen in the POPLAR and BIRCH studies, the toxicity profile was significantly better with immunotherapy. The future is unfolding rapidly as new checkpoint inhibitors are gaining FDA approval. It is still not known if these agents will be used in combination with  chemotherapy, with other immune-modulating agents, radiation therapy, or all of the above. The results of these studies investigating their use in combination with chemotherapy agents, with other immunotherapy agents such as CTLA-4 inhibitors, and with radiation therapy, are eagerly awaited."

However, the signals responsible for upregulation of PD-L1 in NSCLC cells and whether they are integrated with the regulation of other immune-related genes are not known. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly overexpressed in NSCLC, activates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65→︀ZEB1 pathway and confers a poor prognosis. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C activates PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. We show that MUC1-C increases NF-κB p65 occupancy on the CD274/PD-L1 promoter and thereby drives CD274 transcription. Moreover, we demonstrate that MUC1-C-induced activation of NF-κB→︀ZEB1 signaling represses the TLR9 (toll-like receptor 9), IFNG, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and GM-CSF genes, and that this signature is associated with decreases in overall survival. In concert with these results, targeting MUC1-C in NSCLC tumors suppresses PD-L1 and induces these effectors of  innate and adaptive immunity. These findings support a previously unrecognized central role for MUC1-C in integrating PD-L1 activation with suppression of immune effectors and poor clinical outcome."

Tumors evade the immune response partly by suppressing T-cell activity using immune checkpoints. The use of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies counteract this suppression, thereby enhancing the antitumor activity of the immune system. This approach has proven efficacy in melanoma, renal cancer, and lung cancer. There is growing evidence that the central nervous system is accessible to the immune system in the diseased state. Moreover, glioblastomas (GBMs) attract CTLA-4-expressing T-cells and express PD-L1, which inhibit activation and continuation of a cytotoxic T-cell response, respectively. This may contribute to the evasion of the host immune response by GBM. Trials are in progress to determine if checkpoint inhibitors will be of benefit in GBM. Radiotherapy could also be helpful in promoting inflammation, enhancing the immunogenicity of tumors, disrupting the blood-brain barrier and creating greater antigen release. The combination of radiotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors has been promising in preclinical trials but is yet to show efficacy in humans. In this review, we summarize the mechanism and current evidence for checkpoint inhibitors in gliomas and other solid tumors, examine the rationale of combining  radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors, and discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of this approach."

Methods: Thirty-four original studies of prospective ICI trials were identified based on a PubMed search completed on November 1st, 2016. Seventeen studies compared incidences across tumor types. The incidences of all-grade, grade 3-4 (severe) colitis, and grade 3-4 (severe) diarrhea were collected. Results: Thirty-four studies containing 8863 patients were included in the meta-analysis.  The overall incidence during ipilimumab monotherapy was 9.1% for all-grade colitis, 6.8% for severe colitis, and 7.9% for severe diarrhea. The incidence was lowest during PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy with 1.3% for all-grade colitis, 0.9% for severe colitis and 1.2% for severe diarrhea, while combination ipilimumab and nivolumab resulted in the highest incidences of all-grade colitis  (13.6%), severe colitis (9.4%) and severe diarrhea (9.2%) among ICIs. Among melanoma, NSCLC, RCC patients, incidences of colitis and diarrhea with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy did not significantly differ. Severe colitis incidence was  similar with ipilimumab monotherapy at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (7.1% vs 5.1%, respectively), but significantly higher for severe diarrhea with 10mg/kg (11.5% vs 5.2%). The incidence of immune-related colitis and severe diarrhea was higher with ipilimumab-containing regimens compared with PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors. There was no significant difference in immune-related colitis between different tumor types with PD-1/L1 inhibitors."

More than 90% of them are pleomorphic, spindle cell and giant cell carcinoma (PSCGCC). This rare subtype of lung cancer is thought to be more resistant to chemotherapy, and a small subset of them seems to exhibit targetable mutations. Immunotherapy against PD1/PDL-1 is a new emerging treatment, and might be of interest in PSGSCC because they frequently express PD-L1. The aim of our work is  to evaluate PD1 and PDL-1 expression in a surgical series of lung PSCGCC and their relationship with morphological and immunohistochemical parameters and prognosis. Thirty-six patients who underwent surgical resection of a PSGSCC were  included. PD-L1 (E1L3N) expression on tumor cells and PD1 (NAT105) expression by  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were performed by immunohistochemistry. Results were compared to immunohistochemistry tests of TTF1, Napsin A, p40 and to molecular study of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Seventy-five % of PSCGCC were considered as positive for PD-L1.PD-L1 expression in PSGSCC is associated with TTF-1 and/or Napsin A expression (47.2%, p = 0.039). Few p40 positive PSCGCC expressed PD-L1 (8.3%, p = 0.013). PD1 expression was not related to TTF-1 and/or Napsin A expression (p = 0.47), p40 expression (p = 0.68) or survival (p = 0.14). PD-L1 or PD1 expression were not related to the age, gender, pT, pN, stage, visceral pleura invasion, histopathological subtype, the presence of giant cell component, the predominance of sarcomatoid component, and the presence of EGFR or BRAF or HER2 or PIK3CA mutation (p>0.05). PD-L1 expression was correlated with a  worse overall survival in PSCGCC (p = 0.045).

Despite these advances, patient outcomes remain suboptimal, underscoring the need for therapeutic interventions with novel mechanisms of action. The advent of immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has led to significant changes in the treatment landscape for several solid malignancies. Specifically, drugs targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA-4) pathways have demonstrated considerable  clinical efficacy and gained regulatory approval as single-agent or combination therapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, aRCC, advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, urothelial cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. In aRCC, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab was approved in both the United States and Europe for the treatment of patients who have received prior therapy, based on improved overall survival compared with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Other checkpoint inhibitors, including the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab in combination with several agents, and the PD-L1 inhibitor  atezolizumab, are in various stages of clinical development in patients with aRCC. In this review, current evidence related to the clinical use of checkpoint  inhibitors for the treatment of patients with aRCC is discussed, including information on the frequency and management of unconventional responses and the management of immune-related adverse events.

The RMP1-14 antibody  was used to block PD-1, and an L-aptamer was used to inhibit signaling of complement C5a with its receptors. Using syngeneic models of lung cancer, we demonstrate that the combination of C5a and PD-1 blockade markedly reduces tumor  growth and metastasis and leads to prolonged survival. This effect is accompanied by a negative association between the frequency of CD8 T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells within tumors, which may result in a more complete reversal of CD8 T-cell exhaustion.

Recent research has shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling affects PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells;  however, the mechanism regulating PD-L1 expression in tumor cells remains unclear. Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated the impact of expression of PD-L1 and EGF family receptors EGFR and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2  (HER2) in tumor cells from 91 patients with pathological Stage IA-IIIA NSCLC. Overexpression of PD-L1 was observed in 14% of the resected tumors, and associated with poor recurrence-free survival (p = 0.021) and overall survival (p = 0.033). PD-L1 expression is positively correlated with EGFR expression and inversely correlated with HER2. NSCLC cell lines were treated in vitro with the EGFR ligand EGF with or without inhibition of EGFR or HER2, after which PD-L1 expression was evaluated using flow cytometry. Consistent with previous reports,  PD-L1 expression was clearly enhanced by EGF. EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors or  EGFR small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked EGF-induced PD-L1 overexpression in NSCLC cell lines, but HER2 siRNA did not. Moreover, our findings suggest that PD-L1 expression could be partially regulated via the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. We conclude that PD-L1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is positively correlated with EGFR expression but inversely correlated with HER2 expression in NSCLC. We also showed that EGFR and HER2 have different effects on EGF-induced PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cell lines."

Malignant mesothelioma is characterized by a poor prognosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune suppression without immune activation does not improve survival. However, combination of TAM-mediated immune suppression with dendritic cell immunotherapy  generates robust and durable antitumor immunity. These findings provide insights  into the interaction between immunotherapy-induced antitumor T cells and TAMs and offer a therapeutic strategy for mesothelioma treatment."

Tumor RNA before anti-PD1 therapy was analyzed on the nCounter system using the PanCancer 730-Immune Panel, and we identified 23 immune-related genes or signatures linked to response and progression-free survival (PFS). In addition, we evaluated intra- and interbiopsy variability of PD1, PD-L1, CD8A, and CD4 mRNAs and their relationship with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and PD-L1 IHC expression. Among the biomarkers examined, PD1 gene expression along with 12 signatures tracking CD8 and CD4 T-cell activation, natural killer cells, and IFN activation associated significantly with nonprogressive disease and PFS. These associations were independent of sample timing, drug used, or cancer type. TIL correlated moderately (∼0.50) with PD1 and CD8A mRNA levels and weakly (∼0.35) with CD4 and  PD-L1. IHC expression of PD-L1 correlated strongly with PD-L1 (0.90), moderately  with CD4 and CD8A, and weakly with PD1.

Harnessing the immune system to better fight cancer has generated a unique spectrum of immune-related adverse events (IrAEs) that effect  virtually every major organ system. Although lung involvement is less common than other forms of IrAEs, its consequences are potentially lethal. This review focuses on the evolving spectrum of lung toxicities associated with the two major classes of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, cytotoxic T-cell ligand-4, and  programed cell death-1 (PDL-1). RECENT FINDINGS: Lung injury was not reported in the earliest clinical trials of  immune checkpoint inhibitors. More recent studies, however, have described unique radiographic and clinical toxicity profiles that differ significantly from lung injury patterns associated with conventional cytotoxic therapies. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of immune-related lung injury, its radiographic and clinical disease spectrum, associated risk factors, and optimal treatment strategies remain poorly understood. Adverse immune-mediated lung events are increasingly recognized as unique and potentially life-threatening sequelae of checkpoint inhibitor therapies. Early recognition of symptoms and radiographic abnormalities is essential to proper management and successful outcome."

Therefore, the mortality at 5 years is still very high, ranging from 51% to 99%, depending on the stage. The implementation of different molecular techniques has allowed genomic studies even in relatively small histological samples such as obtained with non-invasive or minimally invasive techniques, facilitating a better phenotyping of lung ADC. Thus, current classification differentiates between preinvasive lesions (atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and in situ ADC), minimally invasive ADC (MIA) and invasive ADC. 'Field cancerization' is a concept that refers to progressive loco-regional changes occurring in tissues exposed to carcinogens, due to the interaction of the latter with a predisposing genetic background and an appropriate tissue microenvironment. Somatic genetic alterations, including mutations but also other changes, are necessary for oncogenesis, being especially frequent in lung ADC. Changes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, Kirsten rat sarcoma  viral oncogene (KRAS), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), gene encoding neurofibromin (NF1), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 are the main genes that suffer alterations in the tumors of patients with ADC. Molecular  profiling of these tumors allows more targeted treatments through two distinct strategies, genome-guided therapy and immunotherapy. The former, targets the aberrant pathways secondary to the genomic alteration, whereas the latter may be  based on the administration of antibodies [such as those against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death ligand 1/protein 1 pathway (PD-L1/PD-1)] or the stimulation of the patient's own immune system to produce a specific response. These strategies are obtaining better results in selected ADC patients."

Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are important immune checkpoint molecules that  could cause tumor cells to escape the host immune response. The aim of the study  was to explore the role of PD-L1 in radioresistance and the antitumor effect of combined radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 therapy in NSCLC. The role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and tripartite motif containing 21 in regulating PD-L1 expression after radiotherapy was investigated by small interfering-PD-L1-RNA transfection, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation. The synergistic effect of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibody was evaluated in a mouse model. PD-L1 expression on tumor specimens was examined in a retrospective cohort of patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. PD-L1 expression was increased in vivo and in vitro after conventionally fractionated radiation. Radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody synergistically enhanced antitumor immunity by promoting CD8-positive T-cell infiltration and reducing the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells in a mouse model. Radiotherapy may up-regulate PD-L1 expression through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathways. PD-L1 may also stimulate cell migration and facilitate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process to induce radioresistance. Moreover, down-regulating PD-L1 could alleviate radioresistance by promoting apoptosis. Intriguingly, patients with negative PD-L1 expression had a significantly higher objective response rate (88% versus 43.1% [p < 0.001]) and disease control rate (100% versus 86.2% [p = 0.026]) than  those with positive PD-L1 expression after delivery of radiotherapy. Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody shows a synergistic antitumor immunity in NSCLC.

Objective: To report the cases of 3 consecutive patients with pembrolizumab-induced eruptive KAs and their management. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case report study of 3 patients from 2 centers with pembrolizumab-treated cancer who all developed eruptive KAs. Interventions: All 3 patients had AK treatment with clobetasol ointment and intralesional triamcinolone; 2 patients also underwent open superficial cryosurgery. Results: Three consecutive patients with cancer, 2 men and 1 woman (median age, 83 years; range 77-91 years), experienced pembrolizumab-associated eruptive KAs.  All patients presented with a sudden onset of multiple lesions on sun-exposed areas of their extremities after a median of 13 months (range, 4-18 months) of pembrolizumab therapy. On lesional biopsy, a lichenoid infiltrate was observed in the underlying dermis, predominantly composed of CD3+ T cells, scattered CD20+ B  cells, and relatively few PD-1+ (programmed cell death 1-positive) T cells, an immunophenotypic pattern also observed in other cases of anti-PD-1-induced lichenoid dermatitis. Patients were treated with clobetasol ointment and intralesional triamcinolone, alone or in combination with open superficial cryosurgery. All KAs resolved in all patients, and no new lesions occurred during close follow-up. Pembrolizumab treatment was continued without disruption in all  3 cases, and all patients had complete responses of their primary cancers. Pembrolizumab is used in advanced melanoma, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, and in head and neck cancer. A variety of dermatologic immune-related adverse events including maculopapular eruption, lichenoid reactions, pruritus, and vitiligo have been described. This case series demonstrates that pembrolizumab therapy may also be associated with eruptive KAs  with characteristic dermal inflammation, which improved with corticosteroid treatment (topical and intralesional) alone or in combination with cryosurgery, allowing patients to continue therapy with pembrolizumab."

However, our current understanding of the role of immunotherapies on NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, following acquisition of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), is so far unclear. Especially, there is little data on if each acquired resistance mechanism to EGFR-TKIs alters PD-L1 expression status which is employed as an important predictive biomarker for PD-1/PD-L1 targeting agents. Lung cancer cell lines (HCC827, HCC4006, PC9, H1975, H358, SW900, and H647) and their daughter cells that acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs or cytotoxic drugs (cisplatin or vinorelbine) were examined. PD-L1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and/or fluorescent imaging. Published microarray data were also employed to evaluate our findings. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found correlations between therapy-induced E-cadherin  downregulation and decreased PD-L1 expression using our cell lines and published  microarray data. ShRNA mediated E-cadherin knockdown decreased PD-L1 expression in parental cells, and dual immunofluorescent staining of E-cadherin and PD-L1 suggests co-localization of both molecules. We also observed marked downregulation of PD-L1 in cells with E-cadherin downregulation after chronic treatment with vinorelbine. These results indicate a correlation between therapy-induced E-cadherin downregulation and decreased PD-L1 expression, highlighting the importance of re-biopsy after acquisition of resistance to EGFR-TKIs, not only for the evaluation of resistance mechanisms but also for the  determination of PD-L1 expression status."

The success of these studies has led to the development of various antibodies/inhibitors for the different checkpoint proteins involved in immune evasion of the tumor. Adenosine  present in high concentrations in the tumor microenvironment activates the immune checkpoint adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR), leading to the suppression of antitumor responses. Inhibition of this checkpoint has the potential to enhance antitumor T-cell responsiveness. We developed a novel A2aR antagonist (PBF-509) and tested its antitumor  response in vitro, in a mouse model, and in non-small cell lung cancer patient samples. Our studies showed that PBF-509 is highly specific to the A2aR as well as inhibitory of A2aR function in an in vitro model. In a mouse model, we found that lung metastasis was decreased after treatment with PBF-509 compared with its control. Furthermore, freshly resected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from lung cancer patients showed increased A2aR expression in CD4+ cells and variable expression in CD8+ cells. Ex vivo studies showed an increased responsiveness of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes when PBF-509 was combined with anti-PD-1 or  anti-PD-L1. Our studies demonstrate that inhibition of the A2aR using the novel  inhibitor PBF-509 could lead to novel immunotherapeutic strategies in non-small cell lung cancer."

Outcome data are limited in this population. MATERIAL AND We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with metastatic NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC who received radiation and anti-PD-1 therapy  at four centers. We identified 137 patients who received radiation and PD-1 inhibition. Median survival from first PD-1 therapy was 192, 394, and 121days for NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC patients. Among 59 patients who received radiation following the start of PD-1 blockade, 25 continued to receive PD-1 inhibition for a median  of 179days and survived for a median of 238 additional days. Median survival following first course of radiation for brain metastases was 634days. Melanoma patients received brain directed radiation relatively less frequently following the start of PD-1 inhibitor treatment. Incorporation of palliative radiation does not preclude favorable outcomes in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors; patients irradiated after the  start of PD-1 inhibition can remain on therapy and demonstrate prolonged survival. Of note, patients irradiated for brain metastases demonstrate favorable outcomes compared with historical controls."

It consists of the PD-1 receptor  and its two ligands, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2). Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody approved for malignant melanoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and advanced renal cell carcinoma in Japan. Thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism have both been reported in international Phase 3 studies and national post-marketing surveillance of nivolumab in Japan. This study analyzed five consecutive cases with thyroid dysfunction associated with nivolumab therapy. Second, it examined the mRNA and protein expressions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. All patients were diagnosed with painless thyroiditis. Thyrotoxicosis developed within four weeks from the first administration of nivolumab and normalized within four weeks of onset in three of the five patients. Hypothyroidism after transient thyrotoxicosis developed in two patients, and preexisting hypothyroidism persisted in one patient. The other two patients were  treated with glucocorticoids and discontinued nivolumab therapy for comorbid adverse events. One did not develop hypothyroidism, and the other developed mild, transient hypothyroidism. In addition, it was verified that normal thyroid tissue expresses PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA and those proteins. In the present cases, nivolumab-induced thyrotoxicosis seemed to be  associated with painless thyroiditis, while no patient with Graves' disease was observed. A transient and rapid course with subsequent hypothyroidism was observed in nivolumab-induced thyroiditis. In addition, it was verified that PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed in normal thyroid tissue. This suggests that nivolumab therapy reduces immune tolerance, even in normal thyroid tissue, and leads to the development of thyroiditis. Treating thyrotoxicosis with only supportive care and considering levothyroxine replacement therapy once subsequent hypothyroidism occurs is proposed. Further investigations are required to confirm whether glucocorticoid therapy and discontinuation of nivolumab therapy prevent subsequent hypothyroidism."

T-cell activation and cytotoxic function  is tightly regulated by a series of immune-regulatory receptor-ligand interactions or immune checkpoints. These controls limit immune-mediated damage,  particularly in the context of chronic infection. However, prolonged signalling through these axes can lead to progressive loss of T-cell function, termed exhaustion.Understanding of the biology of checkpoints and that exhaustion is reversible has been key to the development of new therapies directed at reversing the dysfunctional status of T-cells, which are dramatically improving outcomes of cancer treatment.Emerging data suggest that immune checkpoint axes are dysregulated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). T-cells from diseased lungs express the key receptor programmed death (PD)1 and demonstrate loss of cytotoxic function. However, the picture is complex with evidence of downregulation of the associated ligand PDL1 on alveolar macrophages. The resulting impact may be excessive T-cell inflammation as a consequence of acute infection, which may contribute to the pattern of exacerbation and lung damage characteristic of COPD. More work is needed to understand these immune controls in COPD before the therapeutic advances seen in lung cancer can be explored."

Nonetheless, a significant number of patients and malignancies  do not respond to this therapy. To develop a screen for response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition, it is critical to develop a non-invasive tool to accurately assess dynamic immune checkpoint expression. Here we evaluated non-invasive SPECT/CT imaging of PD-L1 expression, in murine tumor models with varying PD-L1 expression, using high affinity PD-L1-specific nanobodies (Nbs). We generated and characterized 37 Nbs recognizing mouse PD-L1. Among those, four Nbs C3, C7, E2 and E4 were selected and evaluated for preclinical imaging of PD-L1 in syngeneic  mice. We performed SPECT/CT imaging in wild type versus PD-L1 knock-out mice, using Technetium-99m (99mTc) labeled Nbs. Nb C3 and E2 showed specific antigen binding and beneficial biodistribution. Through the use of CRISPR/Cas9 PD-L1 knock-out TC-1 lung epithelial cell lines, we demonstrate that SPECT/CT imaging using Nb C3 and E2 identifies PD-L1 expressing tumors, but not PD-L1 non-expressing tumors, thereby confirming the diagnostic potential of the selected Nbs. In conclusion, these data show that Nbs C3 and E2 can be used to non-invasively image PD-L1 levels in the tumor, with the strength of the signal correlating with PD-L1 levels. These findings warrant further research into the use of Nbs as a tool to image inhibitory signals in the tumor environment."

Methods: The expression of PD-1 protein in 88 cases of NSCLC tumor tissues and adjacent tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The mutations of EGFR in NSCLC were detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Amplification Refractory Mutation System(PCR-ARMS) method. The expression of PD-1 and patients' clinical characteristics and prognosis were analyzed. Results: PD-1 was positive in 63.6%(56/88) NSCLC tumor tissues, which was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues (21.6%, 19/88) (P<0.05). EGFR gene mutations were found in 43 cases (48.9%), in which 30 cases (69.8%)were PD-1 positive expression. 45 cases had the wild types of EGFR gene, in which 26 cases (57.8%) were PD-1 positive. There were 24 cases of 19Del EGFR mutations, including 20 cases (83.3%) of PD-1 positive expression. 19 patients had 21L858 EGFR mutations, including 10  cases (52.6%) of PD-1 positive expression. The expression of PD-1 in NSCLC was related to patients' smoking status, lymph node metastasis and EGFR gene mutations (P<0.05). The median progression-free survival time of patients with PD-1 positive and negative expression was 7.03 and 18.66 months, respectively (P=0.007). In patients with wild-type EGFR gene, the median progression-free survival time of PD-1 positive and negative expression was 25.21 and 38.24 months, respectively.

Besides its clinical benefit immune checkpoint therapy leads to significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Some rare irAEs are not well described yet but are critical in patient management. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a case of autoimmune cerebral vasculitis/encephalitis after PD-1 inhibitor treatment for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. Upon PD-1 blockade, the patient developed cerebral lesions, while having disease stabilization of extracranial metastases. Imaging suggested that the patient had new progressing brain metastases. Despite stereotactic irradiation the lesions progressed further. The largest lesion became symptomatic and had to be surgically resected. On examination, cerebral vasculitis was detected but not evidence of metastatic lung cancer. Analysis of the patient's serum revealed the presence of antinuclear antibodies that were already present before starting PD-1 blockade. In addition, we also found anti-vascular endothelial antibodies in the serum. CONCLUSION: This finding suggests that the patient had preformed autoantibodies and the checkpoint inhibitor induced a clinically relevant autoimmune disease. Taken together, encephalitic lesions in patients under PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can mimic metastatic brain lesions and this rare irAE has to be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients treated with immunotherapy."

One hundred and 15 patients with NSCLC were included in this retrospective study from 4 different French centers. Forty-three squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and 72 non-SCC received nivolumab between 2015 and 2016 (3 mg/kg IV Q2W). Response to first-line chemotherapy and to nivolumab was retrospectively assessed on CT-scan by central review. The association between RECIST response to first-line chemotherapy and nivolumab efficacy were determined using Fisher's exact test and Cox proportional hazard model. Respectively 46 (40%), 44 (38%) and 25 (22%) patients experienced partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) in response to first-line platinum- based chemotherapy. Twenty 5 (21%), 34 (30%), 56 (49%) respectively experienced PR, SD and PD in response to nivolumab. 60% (54/90) of patients who experienced clinical benefit (PR + SD) after first-line chemotherapy also had clinical benefit after nivolumab, while only 20% (5/25) of patients with initial PD subsequently experienced clinical benefit with nivolumab (Fisher's exact test, P  = 0.001). The type of first-line doublet chemotherapy did not influence the response rate to nivolumab. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that patients with clinical benefit from first-line chemotherapy had higher second-line PFS (P = 0.003) (median PFS on nivolumab of 5, 3.3 and 1.9 months for patients with PR, SD and PD in response to first-line therapy, respectively). Similar results were obtained for OS. Thus this study suggests that the efficacy of first-line chemotherapy may be a valuable surrogate marker of the benefit of nivolumab in terms of PFS and OS."

We focused on the genetic and functional analysis of β2-microglobulin (B2M), a component of the HLA class-I complex.Results: We identified alterations in genes involved in various functions, such as B2M involved in immunosurveillance. We extended the mutational analysis of B2M to about 230 lung cancers. Five percent of the lung cancers carried somatic mutations, most of which impaired the correct formation of the HLA-I complex. We  also report that genes such as CALR, PDIA3, and TAP1, which are involved in the maturation of the HLA-I complex, are altered in lung cancer. By gene expression microarrays, we observed that restitution of B2M in lung cancer cells upregulated targets of IFNα/IFNγ. Furthermore, one third of the lung cancers lacked the HLA-I complex, which was associated with lower cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration.  The levels of B2M and HLA-I proteins correlated with those of PD-L1. Finally, a deficiency in HLA-I complex and CD8+ infiltration tended to correlate with reduced survival of patients with lung cancer treated with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1.Here, we report recurrent inactivation of B2M in lung cancer. These observations, coupled with the mutations found at CALR, PDIA3, and TAP1, and the downregulation of the HLA-I complex, indicate that an abnormal immunosurveillance axis contributes to lung cancer development. Finally, our observations suggest that an impaired HLA-I complex affects the response to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapies."

The Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, Embase, Medline, and the Science Citation Index were searched for prospective published reports of atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC. Finally, we identified 14 prospective published reports including four trials of atezolizumab covering 542 subjects, three trials of pembrolizumab covering 1566 subjects, seven trials of nivolumab covering 1678 subjects. When compared to docetaxel, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy could significantly improve overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, P<0.001) and progression-free survival  (HR 0.83, P=0.002) for previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy produced an overall response rate of 19% in the 2374 evaluable patients. When using docetaxel as the common comparator, indirect comparison of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy versus EGFR-TKIs showed progression-free survival benefit (HR 0.62, P<0.001) and overall survival benefit (HR 0.60, P<0.001) for those patients with EGFR wild-type. Meanwhile, for those EGFR mutant patients, indirect comparison indicated that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was inferior to EGFR-TKIs therapy in terms of progression-free survival (HR 3.20, P<0.001), but no survival difference (HR 1.30, P=0.18). CONCLUSION: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy could produce progression-free survival and overall survival improvement over docetaxel for patients with previously treated  NSCLC. For EGFR wild-type patients, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy seemed to prolong progression-free survival and overall survival when compared to EGFR-TKIs. Meanwhile, for these EGFR mutant patients, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy was inferior to EGFR-TKIs therapy in terms of progression-free survival."

In lung cancer carcinogenesis is related mainly to tobacco smoking with high somatic mutation rate and immunogenicity. The PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and pembrolizumab  and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab is a labelled indication in second line setting in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Avelumab and durvalumab have promising activity as well. Based on the data of KEYNOTE 024 trial, pembrolizumab is approved in first line setting for cases with ≥50% PD-L1 expression. In this selected patient population, progression-free survival has doubled, and overall survival was significantly better in pembrolizumab-treated patients compared to those receiving standard of care. Pembrolizumab treatment became a new first line standard of care in advanced NSCLC. There are numerous ongoing clinical trials in lung cancer with immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted agents, or in adjuvant setting."

Amongst immunotherapies, the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) proved to be the most effective, primarily in the treatment of solid tumours, including melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. The reason for this efficacy is the  immunosuppressive microenvironment typical for many cancer types, directly and indirectly inhibiting effector T-cell responses. To date, three cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors have been approved in Europe, and six in the USA. Furthermore, an increasing number of these drugs is available in the setting of clinical trials. For the optimal use of the numerous different ICIs there is an ever increasing need to identify reliable predictive biomarkers and to explore therapy-associated resistance mechanisms, which will represent the main challenge of the next years."

Dedicated ir-RECIST criteria have been established to improve this situation. However, this can be sometimes considered inadequate and patients experiencing true progression may then receive inefficient treatments. Additional reliable tools to discriminate pseudo from true progression are thus needed. So far, no biomarker has been identified to distinguish pseudo from true progression. We hypothesize that biomarkers associated with the molecular characteristics of the tumor may be of interest. To avoid a tumor re-biopsy, circulating markers appear to be a less invasive and reproducible procedure. As ctDNA kinetics correlate with the response to treatment in KRAS-mutated adenocarcinoma, we anticipated that this analysis could be of interest. We monitored the level of KRAS-mutated ctDNA by digital droplet PCR in serial plasma samples from two patients who had experienced pseudo-progression and compared the variations with those from of a patient that  had true progression. ctDNA showed rapid and dramatic decreases in pseudo-progressive patients, whereas it was strongly increased in the progressive patient. ddPCR of ctDNA may thus be an additional tool to discriminate pseudo-progression from true progression for tumors that harbor an oncogenic addiction."

Following informed consent, genome-wide exome and RNA-sequencing was performed in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited environment. Actionable targets were identified and therapeutic recommendations made from a pharmacopeia of FDA-approved drugs. Clinical response to genomically-guided treatment was evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The study completed its accrual goal of 12 evaluable patients. The minimum tumor content for successful NGS was 20%, with a median turnaround time from sample collection to genomics-based treatment recommendation of 27 days. At  least two clinically actionable targets were identified in each patient, and six  patients (50%) received treatment identified by NGS. Two had partial responses by RECIST 1.1 on a clinical trial involving a PD-1 inhibitor + irinotecan (indicated by MLH1 alteration). The remaining patients had clinical deterioration before NGS recommended therapy could be initiated. Comprehensive genomic profiling using NGS identified clinically-actionable alterations in SCLC patients who progressed on initial therapy. Recommended PD-1 therapy generated partial responses in two patients. Earlier access to NGS guided therapy, along with improved understanding of those  SCLC patients likely to respond to immune-based therapies, should help to extend  survival in these cases with poor outcomes."

Remarkable regression of the primary tumor was observed, suggesting high anti-tumor activity of nivolumab. We retrospectively investigated the change in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) variant allele fractions in serial plasma samples before and after the nivolumab therapy. Targeted sequencing analysis showed tumor-derived TP53R249S and EGFRL858R mutations detectable in plasma, and the timing of decrease was only 5 days, much earlier than the appearance of radiological changes.

Epub 2017 Apr 28.","Relationship of Metabolic Alterations and PD-L1 Expression in Cisplatin Resistant Lung Cancer.","Despite numerous reports on immune checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the response rate remains low but durable. Thus cisplatin still plays a major role in the treatment of NSCLC. While there are many mechanisms involved in cisplatin resistance, alteration in metabolic phenotypes with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are found in several cisplatin resistant tumors. These resistant cells become more reliant on  mitochondria oxidative metabolism instead of glucose. Consequently, high ROS and  metabolic alteration contributed to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, recent findings indicated that EMT has a crucial role in upregulating PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. Thus, it is very likely that cisplatin resistance will lead to high expression of PD-L1/PD-1 which makes them  vulnerable to anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 antibody treatment. An understanding of the interactions between cancer cells metabolic reprogramming and immune checkpoints  is critical for combining metabolism targeted therapies with immunotherapies."

Depending on the subtype of breast cancer, it is now clear in both primary and metastatic disease that the extent of tumor-infiltrating T cells is not only prognostic for survival but predictive of  response to nonimmune, standard therapies. Despite these findings, immune cytolytic activity in spontaneous breast tumors, the burden of nonsynonymous tumor mutations, and the predicted load of neoepitopes-factors linked to response to checkpoint blockade in other malignancies-are all relatively modest in breast  cancer compared with melanoma or lung cancer. Thus, in breast cancer, combinations of immune agents with nonredundant mechanisms of action are high-priority strategies. For most breast cancers that exhibit relatively modest  T-cell infiltration, major challenges include immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment as well as failed or suboptimal T-cell priming. Agents that trigger de novo T-cell responses may be critical for the successful development of cancer immunotherapy and immune prevention in breast cancer. Success may also  require reaching beyond nonsynonymous mutations as the T-cell epitopes to target, especially as numerous unmutated proteins were validated as breast cancer-associated antigens in the pre-checkpoint era. A deeper understanding of the immunobiology of breast cancer will be critical for immunotherapy to become broadly relevant in this disease."

Several next generation ALK inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with crizotinib refractory NSCLC patients including in the CNS. Based on available data, therapy with a next generation ALK inhibitor can be initiated following therapy with crizotinib without any assessment of the molecular mechanisms of resistance. The appropriate therapy for patients with progressive disease following two ALK inhibitors is not well defined. In patients with an ALK-resistant mutation in their tumor, an ALK inhibitor with activity against the mutation would be the most appropriate therapy. In others, chemotherapy and PD-1  directed agents can be considered.

For standard therapy, however, there are good data to support the practice of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) testing in the front-line advanced setting and to use pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for those with ≥50% PD-L1 expression. In those who have progressed after receiving platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line, multiple PD-1/PD-L1 agents are available and currently approved, including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab. There are no data to suggest that one agent is more efficacious than the others, but pembrolizumab should be reserved for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%. Prescribers and patients must be cognizant of the toxicity profile of these agents, as severe immune-related adverse events can occur with therapy. At this time, this practice pattern for immunotherapy in the first- and second-line can be considered the standard of care, but new data are likely to impact the role of immunotherapy as  monotherapy or in combination in the near future."

Results from recent phase II and phase III randomised trials testing other ICIs have been presented. In Keynote-024, pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, was reported to have great efficacy in the first-line treatment of PDL1 ≥ 50% tumours (30% of screened tumours), with a progression-free survival (PFS, median) of 10.4 months versus 6.0 months with chemotherapy (CT; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.37-0.68, P < 0.001), overall response rate (ORR) of 45% versus 28% with CT (P = 0.0011), and a 1-year overall survival (OS) of around 70%. In contrast, Checkmate-026 reported that nivolumab failed to show any benefit compared with standard platinum-based CT, with a PFS (median) in the PDL1 ≥ 5% NSCLC group of 4.2 months (nivolumab) versus 5.9 months (CT; HR = 1.15: 95% CI 0.91-1.45, P = 0.25).

Immune-related adverse events, defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, were tabulated in relation to treatment variables, and associations with sequencing and timing were assessed. We identified 133 patients, of whom 28 received a CTLA-4 inhibitor alone, 88 received a PD-1 inhibitor alone, and 17 received both classes of inhibitors either sequentially (n=13) or concurrently (n=4). Fifty-six patients received radiation within 14 days of an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Forty-six patients experienced at least 1 ir-AE (34.6%). Patients receiving both CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibitors experienced more any-grade ir-AEs as compared with either individually (71% vs 29%, P=.0008). Any-grade ir-AEs occurred in 39% of patients  in whom radiation was administered within 14 days of immunotherapy, compared with 23% of other patients (P=.06) and more often in patients who received higher equivalent dose in 2-Gy fractions (EQD2) EQD2 (P=.01). However, most toxicities were mild. There were no associations between site irradiated and specific ir-AEs. Our data suggest the combination of focal palliative radiation and CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 inhibitors is well tolerated, with manageable ir-AEs that did  not seem to be associated with the particular site irradiated. Although conclusions are limited by the heterogeneity of patients and treatments, and future confirmatory studies are needed, this information can help guide clinical  practice for patients receiving immune checkpoint therapy who require palliative  radiation therapy."

The MET/HGF axis appears to be another signaling pathway frequently altered in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Our study was aimed  to investigate the expression and prognostic roles of PD-L1 and c-MET in SCLC. The expression levels of PD-L1 and c-MET were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in 83 SCLC specimens. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the SCLC specimens, 51.8% and 25.3% exhibited positivity for PD-L1 and c-MET, respectively. Higher PD-L1 expression in tumor specimens was significantly correlated with a limited disease (LD) stage, normal levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). No association was found between the levels of c-MET and PD-L1 expression or between c-MET expression and other clinical characteristics. SCLC patients with PD-L1-positive tumors showed significantly longer overall survival (OS) than patients with PD-L1-negative tumors (17.0 vs 9.0, p=0.018). Conversely, those with positive c-MET expression exhibited a shorter OS trend (12.0 vs 15.0, p=0.186). However, sub-analysis of LD-stage patients revealed longer OS among the c-MET-negative group (25.0 vs 14.0; p=0.011). The OS of patients with positivity  for both PD-L1 and c-MET showed no significant difference compared with other patients (p=0.17). According to multivariate analyses, neither PD-L1 nor c-MET immunoreactivity was a prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: Expression of PD-L1 was correlated with LD stage and might serve as a prognostic for better OS in SCLC patients. In LD-stage patients, high c-MET expression might be predictive of a poor outcome."

Selection of patients is mandatory and PD-L1 is the only biomarker currently available in clinical practice. However, PD-L1 staining is an imperfect marker, whose negativity does not exclude a response to immunotherapy, as well as the roughly half of patients are not-responders despite high tumor PD-L1 levels. The right cut-off, the differences among various immune checkpoint inhibitors and among various antibody clones, and a not trivial activity reported even in PD-L1 negative tumors are questions still open.

A home-made ELISA was developed and validated according to the general recommendations for the immunoassays. Then, the ELISA method was applied to quantify plasma trough levels (Cmin) of nivolumab (3mg/kg every two weeks) in 27 NSCLC patients at days 14, 28  and 42 after start of treatment. Blood samples were collected just before the infusion on days 0 (baseline), 14, 28 and 42 after start of treatment. The dynamic calibration range for nivolumab assay was 5-100μg/mL. Within- and between-day imprecision for quality controls (5, 20 and 75μg/mL) were less than 5 and 12%, respectively. The mean (±standard deviation) nivolumab Cmin was 17.3±4.8μg/mL (coefficient of variation, CV=27.8%), 25.0±9.7μg/mL (CV=38.8%) and  33.0±12.9μg/mL (CV=39.1%) on days 14, 28 and 42, respectively.

Furthermore, the correlation between the SUVmax and PD-L1 expression has not been assessed. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between PD-L1 expression and the SUVmax on 18FDG-PET and to examine the prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression and the  SUVmax in surgical pulmonary SCC. Expression of PD-L1 was examined in 84 patients with resected SCC using immunohistochemistry. Positive PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was observed in 58.3% (49/84) of patients with SCC. High PD-L1 expression levels were significantly correlated with histological differentiation (P=0.006), and a high SUVmax was associated with histological differentiation (P=0.037), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.025). Spearman's test showed that there was a significant correlation between PD-L1 expression levels and the SUVmax. High PD-L1 expression levels and a high SUVmax were both independent risks factors for poor overall survival. Our results suggested that high PD-L1 expression levels and a high SUVmax was associated with poor prognosis in surgical pulmonary SCC. The existence of a statistically significant correlation between the SUVmax and PD-L1 expression levels justifies exploring the usefulness of the SUVmax as a predictor of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor activity."

Tumour cells frequently overexpress the ligand for PD-1, programmed cell death ligand 1  (PD-L1), facilitating their escape from the immune system. Monoclonal antibodies  that block the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1, by binding to either the ligand or receptor, have shown notable clinical efficacy in patients with a variety of cancers, including melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although it is well established that PD-1-PD-L1 blockade activates T cells, little is known about the role that this pathway may  have in tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). Here we show that both mouse and human TAMs express PD-1. TAM PD-1 expression increases over time in mouse models  of cancer and with increasing disease stage in primary human cancers. TAM PD-1 expression correlates negatively with phagocytic potency against tumour cells, and blockade of PD-1-PD-L1 in vivo increases macrophage phagocytosis, reduces tumour growth and lengthens the survival of mice in mouse models of cancer in a macrophage-dependent fashion. This suggests that PD-1-PD-L1 therapies may also function through a direct effect on macrophages, with substantial implications for the treatment of cancer with these agents."

In this exploratory study we assessed the differences in T-cell subsets and PD-1 expression levels on T-cells in tumour-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To evaluate this, flow cytometric analyses were performed on endobronchial ultrasound-guided (EBUS) fine-needle aspirates (FNA) from TDLNs of patients with NSCLC, and the results were compared to paired PBMC samples.

STUDY DESIGN: Data mining of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 530 patients with HNSCC were pulled from the TCGA using cBioPortal. Primary tumor site data was available in 279 of the samples (52.6%), of which oral cavity was the most common site (61.6%) followed by larynx (25.8%). Other PD-1-sensitive tumors were analyzed to compare PD-L1 expression in HNSCC relative to other tumors including bladder, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and lung carcinomas. A significant fraction of HNSCC tumors have genetic alterations in PD-L1 (6.2%). HNSCC has the highest PD-L1 expression of all of the tumor types examined, with a median 60-fold increase. Several important genes were identified in this study including Caspase 7, ZFYVE9, and Plg-R(KT) that have a strong relationship with alterations in PD-L1.

In a cell-specific fashion, melanoma isolates released the immunogenic protein HMGB1 into the extracellular environment. Very similar data were obtained in ovarian and H&NSCC PDX isolates, and in established tumor cell lines from the lung and kidney.

As the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) proliferates, the incidence of autoimmune side effects associated with these agents, termed immune related adverse events (irAE), is expected to increase. The frequency of significant irAE in ICI treated patients is about 10-20% and early recognition is critical to prevent serious morbidity and even mortality. New onset autoimmune diabetes mellitus (DM) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment is extremely rare, occurring in less than 1% of patients. Autoimmune DM often presents as diabetic ketoacidosis, a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. We describe the  first reported case of a patient with lung cancer who developed autoimmune diabetes after nivolumab treatment and was found to have three diabetes related (islet) autoantibodies present before ICI treatment and seroconversion of another after ICI treatment and onset of autoimmune DM. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34 year old African American woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was treated with nivolumab in the second line setting after disease progression following standard chemoradiation therapy. After receiving two doses of nivolumab, the patient developed abrupt onset of hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Autoimmune diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of undetectable C-peptide levels, seropositivity of three diabetes related  (islet) autoantibodies and absolute insulin dependence. The patient eventually required use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump) due to erratic glycemic excursions and multiple readmissions for DKA. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genoyping revealed none of the high risk haplotypes associated with the development of type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, a frozen blood sample obtained prior to treatment with nivolumab tested positive for three of the four diabetes  related (islet) autoantibodies despite no prior history of diabetes and no family history of diabetes. Notably, at the time of manuscript preparation, the patient  is without evidence of NSCLC recurrence with no further treatment since the nivolumab therapy. CONCLUSION: New onset autoimmune diabetes mellitus associated with nivolumab has  been described only in case reports and occurs at rates of < 1% in the large clinical trials which garnered FDA approval in the second line setting for NSCLC. As ICI use continues to expand across a wide variety of malignancies, clinicians  must maintain a high index of suspicion for irAE, including autoimmune DM and other endocrinopathies. A multidisciplinary team and thorough education of the patient are recommended to optimize management of new onset adult autoimmune DM.  Our patient may have been at greater risk for the development of ICI related autoimmune diabetes due to the presence of three diabetes related autoantibodies  prior to therapy; however, about half of the reported cases of autoimmune DM after anti-PD-1 therapy occurred in patients with no detectable diabetes related  autoantibodies. Further studies are needed to delineate genetic and immunologic biomarkers that may be useful in identifying patients at risk of developing ICI related autoimmune DM."

It can be highly represented in tumor patients, but its relevance in human cancer development is not clear. In this study, we provide evidence that IL-18 is principally expressed in tumor cells and, in concert with other conventional Th1 cell-driven cytokines, has a pivotal  role in establishing a pro-inflammatory milieu in the tumor microenvironment of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Interestingly, the analysis of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cell populations showed that (i) the relative IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) is significantly more expressed by the minority of cells with a functional phenotype (T-bet+Eomes+), than by the majority of those with the dysfunctional phenotype T-bet-Eomes+ generally resident within tumors; (ii) as a  consequence, the former are significantly more responsive than the latter to IL-18 stimulus in terms of IFNγ production ex vivo; (iii) PD-1 expression does not discriminate these two populations. These data indicate that IL-18R may represent a biomarker of the minority of functional tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in adenocarcinoma NSCLC patients. In addition, our results lead to envisage the possible therapeutic usage of IL-18 in NSCLC, even in combination with other  checkpoint inhibitor approaches."

Results were correlated with transcriptome data. Significant differences in the CpG-methylation patterns between tumor tissues and matched controls were observed for CTLA4 and PDCD1 (PD1) showing a decreased methylation  of these genes compared to matched tumor-free tissues from the same patients. Results were confirmed by bisulfide sequencing in an independent validation cohort. Hypomethylation also resulted in increased expression of these genes as shown by transcriptome data.

Therapies that block the  PD-1 pathway have shown promising clinical results in a significant number of advanced-stage cancer patients. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the immunological responses induced by PD-1 blockade in cancer patients is lacking. Identification of predictive biomarkers is a priority in the field, but whether peripheral blood analysis can provide biomarkers to monitor or predict patients'  responses to treatment remains to be resolved. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal blood samples from advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (n = 29) receiving PD-1-targeted therapies. We detected an increase in Ki-67+ PD-1+ CD8 T cells following therapy in ∼70% of patients, and most responses were induced after the first or second treatment cycle. This T-cell activation was not indiscriminate because we observed only minimal effects on EBV-specific CD8 T cells, suggesting that responding cells may be tumor specific. These proliferating CD8 T cells had an effector-like phenotype (HLA-DR+, CD38+, Bcl-2lo), expressed costimulatory molecules (CD28, CD27, ICOS), and had high levels of PD-1 and coexpression of CTLA-4. We found that 70% of patients with disease progression had either a delayed or absent PD-1+ CD8 T-cell response, whereas 80% of patients with clinical benefit exhibited PD-1+ CD8 T-cell responses within 4 wk of treatment initiation. Our results suggest that peripheral blood analysis may provide valuable insights into NSCLC patients' responses to PD-1-targeted therapies."

Programmed death-1 or PD-1 is a checkpoint molecule on T cells that plays a vital role in limiting adaptive immune responses and preventing autoimmune and auto-inflammatory reactivity in the normal host. In cancer patients, PD-1 expression is very high on T cells in the tumor microenvironment, and PD-L1, its  primary ligand, is variably expressed on tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells within tumors, providing a potent inhibitory influence within the tumor microenvironment. While PD-L1 expression on tumors is often regarded as a negative prognostic factor, it is clearly associated with a positive outcome for  treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, and has been used to select patients for this therapy. Responses of long duration, a minority of patients with atypical responses in which progression may precede tumor shrinkage, and a pattern of autoimmune side effects often seen with this class of drugs characterize therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking drugs. While excellent efficacy has been seen with a limited number of tumor types, most epithelial cancers do not show responses of long duration with these agents.

Since inhibition of CTLA-4 or PD-1 leads to non-selective activation of the immune system, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are frequent. Enterocolitis is a common irAE, currently managed with corticosteroids  and, if necessary, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy. Such a regimen carries a risk of serious side-effects including infections, and may potentially imply impaired antitumor effects. Vedolizumab is an anti-integrin α4β7 antibody with gut-specific immunosuppressive effects, approved for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We report a case series of seven patients with metastatic melanoma or lung cancer, treated with vedolizumab off-label for ipilimumab- or nivolumab-induced enterocolitis, from June 2014 through October 2016. Clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and histologic data were analyzed. Patients initially received corticosteroids but were steroid-dependent and/or partially refractory.  One patient was administered infliximab but was refractory. The median time from  onset of enterocolitis to start of vedolizumab therapy was 79 days. Following vedolizumab therapy, all patients but one experienced steroid-free enterocolitis  remission, with normalized fecal calprotectin. This was achieved after a median of 56 days from vedolizumab start, without any vedolizumab-related side-effects noted. The patient in whom vedolizumab was not successful, due to active ulcerative colitis, received vedolizumab prophylactically. This is the first case series to suggest that vedolizumab is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic for steroid-dependent or partially refractory ICPI-induced enterocolitis. A larger prospective study to evaluate vedolizumab in this indication is warranted."

The melanoma discovery cohort was drawn from the phase I Keynote 001 trial, whereas the melanoma validation cohort was drawn from Keynote  002, 006, and EAP trials and the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort from Keynote 001. Liver metastasis was associated with reduced response and shortened  progression-free survival [PFS; objective response rate (ORR), 30.6%; median PFS, 5.1 months] compared with patients without liver metastasis (ORR, 56.3%; median PFS, 20.1 months) P ≤ 0.0001, and confirmed in the validation cohort (P = 0.0006). The presence of liver metastasis significantly increased the likelihood  of progression (OR, 1.852; P < 0.0001). In a subset of biopsied patients (n = 62), liver metastasis was associated with reduced CD8+ T-cell density at the invasive tumor margin (liver metastasis+ group, n = 547 ± 164.8; liver metastasis- group, n = 1,441 ± 250.7; P < 0.016). A reduced response rate and shortened PFS was also observed in NSCLC patients with liver metastasis [median PFS, 1.8 months; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-2.0], compared with those without liver metastasis (n = 119, median PFS, 4.0 months; 95% CI, 2.1-5.1), P =  0.0094. Thus, liver metastatic patients with melanoma or NSCLC that had been treated with pembrolizumab were associated with reduced responses and PFS, and liver metastases were associated with reduced marginal CD8+ T-cell infiltration,  providing a potential mechanism for this outcome."

Antibodies directed against programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) are currently assessed within clinical trials. We present updated data on our experience with checkpoint inhibitors as a compassionate use off-label treatment attempt for highly-pretreated patients with GCT and provide an overview of the current literature on PD-L1 expression in this rare tumour entity. We analysed all patients with platinum refractory GCT treated with checkpoint inhibitors at our institutions between 2015 and 2017. Data were retrieved retrospectively from the patient charts. Seven patients were treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Four patients received single-dose treatment and died shortly afterwards due to tumour progression; the remaining three patients received treatment for at least 6 months. No significant treatment toxicity was observed. Long-term tumour response was achieved in two of the three patients, both of them highly positive for PD-L1 staining. INTERPRETATION: We consider checkpoint inhibition to be efficient in carefully selected patients with platinum refractory GCT. However, predictive markers associated with tumour response are not yet known and larger prospective clinical trials are warranted."

CTLA-4, expressed on T cells, interacts with CD80/CD86, thereby limiting T-cell activation and leading to anergy. PD-1 is predominantly expressed on T cells and its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and tumors sends a negative signal to T cells, which can lead to T-cell exhaustion. Given their role in suppressing effector T-cell responses, immune checkpoints are being targeted for the treatment of cancer. Indeed, antibodies binding to CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 have shown remarkable efficacy, especially in combination therapies, for a number of cancers and have been licensed for the treatment of melanoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and renal and bladder cancers. Moreover, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to enhance ex vivo effector T-cell responses from patients with chronic viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection, including HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. Although the data from clinical trials in infectious diseases are still sparse, these inhibitors have great potential for treating chronic infections, especially when combined with therapeutic vaccines."

The authors report the incidence of irAEs based on the currently available data involving NSCLC and provide recommendations on the general approach to irAEs, as well as indications for the most relevant site-specific events. Expert opinion: Since irAEs may involve a wide range of organs and systems and are potentially reversible if promptly treated, early diagnosis should always be achieved; this might be particularly challenging when other potential causes of toxicity are suspected, such as infections or concurrent treatments. Finally, drugs active on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis appear to be generally manageable even when they are administered to patients with relevant comorbidities, provided that adequate clinical monitoring is performed."

Despite a treatment paradigm shift due to molecularly-targeted therapies and immunotherapy, a majority of patients will receive chemotherapy during their treatment course. Either used alone or in combination, tubulin inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefits in different  settings of lung cancer management. Areas covered: This review first discusses FDA-approved tubulin inhibitors for NSCLC, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, and nab-paclitaxel. The article then provides a summary of novel tubulin inhibitors, including cabazitaxel, eribulin, ixabepilone, patupilone, plinabulin, new colchicine analogues and others. It also discusses new tubulin inhibitor combinations with immunotherapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) and molecularly-targeted therapies (e.g. anti-angiogenic agents, mTOR inhibitors, heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, and anti-HER3 agents). Lastly,  emerging data on potential resistance mechanisms and predictive biomarkers for tubulin inhibitors are explored. Expert opinion: Tubulin inhibitors will likely continue to play important roles in NSCLC management due to the advent of novel agents and combinations. Through further understanding of tumor biology, investigation of drug resistance, and development of predictive biomarkers, we will be better positioned to incorporate microtubule inhibition into patient specific treatment strategies."

The limited toxicity profile and the ability to treat for prolonged periods, even in smokers, is a welcome expansion of the therapeutic arsenal of the oncologist. Areas covered: This review highlights the results of recent clinical trials on pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

Additionally, implications of the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay with the 22C3 antibody and its use in clinical practice and trials is discussed.  Expert commentary: A higher overall response, overall survival and a moderate toxicity profile is observed with the use of pembrolizumab, compared to chemotherapy, in both first and second line. These promising results have already translated into the registration of pembrolizumab in first and second line in patients with a high expression of PD-L1. However, as PD-L1 staining does not sufficiently discriminate responders from non-responders for all checkpoint inhibitors, there still is a need for a better predictive biomarker."

The updated survival hazard ratios (HR) were included in the analysis. 14 studies with 2857 patients were included (2019 treated with immunotherapy). The response rate was as higher among PD-L1-positive patients (RR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.63-2.94).

Lymphocyte activating 3 gene (LAG-3) is another important checkpoint, and  its role in NSCLC is still not clear. In this study we investigated lymphocyte activing 3 (LAG-3) protein expression; its correlation with PD-1, PD-L1, and tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TILs); and its association with survival in NSCLC. The expression of LAG-3 (EPR4392 [Abcam, Cambridge, MA]) protein was assessed in 55 NSCLC cell lines by immunohistochemistry. LAG-3, PD-1 (NAT 105 [Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA]), and PD-L1 (22C3 [Dako, Carpenteria, CA]) protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and TIL abundance was scored in 139 surgically resected specimens from patients with NSCLC. We also verified results in samples from 62 patients with untreated NSCLC and detected a correlation between LAG-3 expression and EGFR and KRAS mutation and echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 gene (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement. LAG-3 was not expressed on any of the 55 NSCLC cell lines. However, LAG-3 was expressed on the TILs in 36 patients with NSCLC (25.9%). Sixty patient  samples (43.2%) were positive for PD-1 on the TILs, and 25 (18.0%) were positive  for PD-L1 on tumor cells. Neither LAG-3 nor PD-1 was expressed on the tumor cells. LAG-3 was overexpressed on the TILs in nonadenocarcinoma compared with in  adenocarcinoma (p = 0.031). LAG-3 expression on TILs was significantly correlated with that of PD-1 on TILs (p < 0.001) and PD-L1 on tumor cells (p = 0.041) but not with TIL percentage (p = 0.244). With the logistic regression model, the ORs  for LAG-3 were 0.320 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.110-0.929) and 4.364 (95% CI: 1.898-10.031) when nonadenocarcinoma was compared with adenocarcinoma and TILs that were negative for PD-1 were compared with those positive for PD-1. Recurrence-free survival was significantly different in patients whose TILs were  LAG-3-negative as opposed to LAG-3-positive (1.91 years [95% CI: 0.76-3.06] versus 0.87 years [95% CI: 0.27-1.47] [p = 0.025]). Likewise, LAG-3 status of TILs (negative versus positive) did significantly affect overall survival (OS) (3.04 years [95% CI: 2.76-3.32] versus 1.08 years [95% CI: 0.42-1.74] [p = 0.039]). Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that patients with both PD-L1-negative tumor cells and LAG-3-negative TILs have longer recurrence-free survival than patients who are either PD-L1- or LAG-3-positive or both PD-L1- and LAG-3-positive (2.09 years [95% CI: 0.90-3.28] versus 1.42 years [95% CI: 0.46-2.34] versus 0.67 years [95% CI: 0.00-1.45] [p = 0.007]). In the verification stage, high expression of LAG-3 was also significantly correlated with higher expression of PD-1 on TILs (p = 0.016) and PD-L1 on tumor cells (p =  0.014). There was no correlation between LAG-3 expression and EGFR (p = 0.325) and KRAS mutation (p = 1.000) and ALK fusion (p = 0.562). LAG-3 is expressed on TILs in tumor tissues of some patients with NSCLC. Its expression was higher in nonadenocarcinoma and correlated with PD-1/PD-L1 expression. LAG-3 positivity or both LAG-3 and PD-L1 positivity was correlated with early postoperative recurrence. LAG-3 was related to poor prognosis."

We retrospectively probed the first 71 pairs of patients with lung adenocarcinoma from our institution. They were analyzed for PD-L1 by IHC using the clone 22C3 pharmDx kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and evaluated  for co-occurrence of genomic aberrations and clinicopathologic characteristics. Surgical resection specimens, small biopsy (transbronchial or core needle) samples, and cytologic cell blocks (needle aspirates or pleural fluid) were tested. A PD-L1 TPS of at least ≥50% was seen in 29.6% of tumors. Of 19 tumors with EGFR mutations, ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization positivity, or ROS1 fluorescence in situ hybridization positivity, 18 had a PD-L1 TPS less than  50% versus only one tumor with a PD-L1 TPS of at least 50% (p = 0.0073). Tumors with a PD-L1 TPS of at least 50% were significantly associated with smoking status compared with tumors with a PD-L1 TPS less than 50% but were not associated with patient sex, ethnicity, tumor stage, biopsy site, or biopsy type/preparation. PD-L1 IHC can be performed on routine clinical lung cancer specimens. A TPS of at least 50% seldom overlaps with presence of driver oncogenes with approved targeted therapies. Three biomarker-specified groups of advanced lung adenocarcinomas can now be defined, each paired with a specific palliative first-line systemic therapy of proven clinical benefit: (1) EGFR/ALK/ROS1-affected adenocarcinoma paired with a matched tyrosine kinase inhibitor (∼20% of cases), (2) PD-L1-enriched adenocarcinoma (TPS ≥50%) paired with anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab (∼30% of cases), and (3) biomarker-negative (i.e., EGFR/ALK/ROS1/PD-L1-negative) adenocarcinoma paired with platinum doublet chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (∼50% of cases)."

Eligible patients had advanced squamous-cell carcinoma, adenosquamous-cell carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus refractory or intolerant to fluoropyrimidine-based, platinum-based, and taxane-based chemotherapy. Patients were treated with 3 mg/kg nivolumab given intravenously once every 2 weeks in 6-week cycles. The primary endpoint was centrally assessed objective response (the proportion of patients whose best response was complete or partial response), according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Adverse events and treatment-related adverse events (defined as events for which a causal relation to nivolumab could not be ruled out) were monitored throughout the study. The safety analysis was done in patients who received at least one dose of nivolumab, and drug activity was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of nivolumab and had at least one central assessment of tumour response. This study is registered with clinicaltrials.jp, number ONO-4538-07/JapicCTI-No.142422. Follow-up of patients is ongoing.

Therapy is based on surgery, but not all carcinomas are completely resectable, e.g. because carcinomas often show infiltration of nerves. For further therapy decision pathology is recommended, but evaluation of potential targets for personalized therapy is not  part of the routine panel. Many salivary gland carcinomas can be resistant to radio- and/or chemotherapy, which limits therapeutic options. This review summarizes new concepts for personalized therapy in salivary gland carcinoma patients. Targeting growth receptors HER2, EGFR, AR and ER is possible but, in some studies, potential target molecules were not adequately tested before therapy. In addition, approximately 20-25% of carcinomas have RAS mutation (mainly H-RAS), which could explain resistance to therapy. Possible therapy options in the future could be immunomodulation (inhibition of PDL1/PD1 signalling), nanoparticles (gold nanoparticles conjugated to cetuximab can increase radiosensitivity) and drug delivery systems (trastuzumab emtansine/T-DM1)."

Its presently known ligands, programmed death ligands (PD-Ls) 1 and 2, are expressed by a variety of cells including cancer cells, suggesting a role for these molecules as an immune evasion mechanism. Blocking of the PD-1-PD-L signaling axis has recently been shown to be effective and was clinically approved in relapsed/refractory tumors such as malignant melanoma and lung cancer, but also classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. A plethora of trials exploring PD-1 blockade in cancer are ongoing. Here, we review the role of PD-1 signaling in lymphoid malignancies, and the latest results of trials investigating PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking agents in this group of diseases. Early phase studies proved very promising, leading to the clinical approval of a PD-1 blocking agent in Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Phase III clinical studies are either planned or ongoing in most lymphoid malignancies."

Here, we designed and synthesized a bispecific antibody (BsAb) that can bind cellular-mesenchymal to epithelial transition factor (c-MET, overexpressed in several human solid tumor), and programmed death-1 (PD-1, involved in cancer cell immune evasion) with high affinity and specificity. We found that BsAb can induce the degradation of c-MET protein in cancer cells, including MKN45, a gastric cancer cell line, and A549, a lung cancer cell line. BsAb inhibited hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-mediated proliferation, migration, and antiapoptosis, and downregulated HGF-stimulated phosphorylation of c-MET, protein kinase B (AKT), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). BsAb can also rescue T cell activation. Furthermore, xenograft analysis revealed that BsAb markedly inhibits the growth of subcutaneously implanted tumors and chronic inflammation. On the basis of these results, we have identified a potential bispecific drug, which can effectively target c-MET and PD-1 for the treatment of human solid cancers."

There is clearly a significant unmet need for new drugs and therapies to further improve the treatment outcomes of GI malignancies. Immunotherapy is a novel treatment strategy that is emerging as an  effective and promising treatment option against several types of cancers. CTLA-4 and PD-1 are critical immune checkpoint molecules that negatively regulate T cell activation via distinct mechanisms. Immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies directed against these pathways has already shown clinical efficacy that has led  to their FDA approval in the treatment of several solid tumors including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and head and neck cancer. This review will summarize the current clinical progress of modern immunotherapy in the field of GI tumors, with a special focus  on immune checkpoint blockade."

Despite remarkable advances in targeted therapy, advanced lung cancer patients have not experienced a significant improvement in mortality. Lung cancer has been shown to be immunogenic and responsive to checkpoint blockade therapy. Checkpoint signals such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 dampen T cell activation and allow tumors to escape the adaptive immune response. Response rates in patients with pretreated, advanced NSCLC were much higher and more durable with PD-1 blockade therapy compared to standard-of-care, cytotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, PD-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab were rapidly approved for both squamous and nonsquamous lung cancer in the pretreated  population. The advent of these new therapies have revolutionized the treatment of lung cancer; however, the majority of NSCLC patients still do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition leaving an unmet need for a large and growing population.Immunotherapy combinations with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or novel immunomodulatory agents are currently being examined with the hope of achieving higher response rates and improving overall survival rate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy has been theorized to increase the release of tumor antigen leading to increased responses with immunotherapy. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also destroy actively proliferating T cells. The correct combination and order of therapy is under investigation. The majority of patients who do respond to immunotherapy have a durable response attributed to the effect of adaptive immune system's memory. Unfortunately, some  patients' tumors do progress afterward and investigation of checkpoint blockade resistance is still nascent.This review will summarize the latest efficacy and safety data for early and advanced NSCLC in both the treatment-naïve and pretreated settings. The emerging role of immunotherapy for the treatment of small cell lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma will also be discussed."

Nevertheless, the high degree of non-responders demonstrates that we are still far from completely understanding the events underlying tumor immune resistance. Although the expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissue has been correlated with clinical response to anti PD-1 inhibitors, the ability of this marker to discriminate the subgroup of patients who derive benefit from immunotherapy is suboptimal. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), as an accessible source of tumor for biologic characterization that can be serially obtained with minimally invasive procedure, hold significant promise to facilitate treatment-specific biomarkers discovery. We recently demonstrated that the presence of PD-L1 on CTCs apparently predicts resistance to the anti-PD-1 Nivolumab in metastatic NSCLC patients and that PD-L1 positive CTCs usually have  an elongated morphology that can be ascribed to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We here demonstrate for the first time that PD-L1 positive CTCs isolated from NSCLC patients are characterized by partial EMT phenotype, and hypothesize that the co-expression of PD-L1 and EMT markers might represent for these cells a possible molecular background for immune escape."

Chemotherapy has offered modest improvements in survival over the past two decades. Immune checkpoint modulation with programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibition has shown the promise of changing the future landscape of cancer therapy. This update reviews recent advances in the treatment of NSCLC with immune checkpoint modulation. Publications and proceedings were identified from searching PubMed and proceedings from the annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and European Lung Cancer Conference. Atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab increase overall survival in  second-line treatment of Stage III/IV squamous and non-squamous NSCLC when compared to docetaxel. Pembrolizumab increases progression-free survival in the first-line treatment of Stage IV NSCLC with 50% PD-L1 expression when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy. Combination therapy with chemotherapy and cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors has shown promise in early  trials. CONCLUSION: Immune checkpoint modulation produces durable responses and overall survival benefits with less toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy. Future investigations are combining PD-1/L1 inhibition with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or other immuno-oncology agents in an effort to further improve efficacy."

We report the long-term safety and clinical activity of pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC and the correlation between PD-L1 expression and efficacy. Patients and methods: In the open-label phase 1b KEYNOTE-001 trial, treatment-naive patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (≥1% staining, assessed using a prototype assay) were randomly assigned to intravenous pembrolizumab 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 (Q3W) or 2 (Q2W) weeks. Response was assessed per central RECIST v1.1 every 9 weeks in all patients who received ≥1 pembrolizumab dose.

Results: Between 1 March 2013 and 18 September 2015, 101 patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W (n = 6), 10 mg/kg Q3W (n = 49), or 10 mg/kg Q2W (n = 46). Of these, 27 (26.7%) had TPS ≥50%, 52 (51.5%) had TPS 1%-49%, and 12 (11.9%) had TPS <1%. The objective response rate (ORR) was 27% (27/101, 95% CI 18-37) and median overall survival was 22.1 months (95% CI 17.1-27.2).

The efficacy of several agents appears correlated with PD-L1 expression. It remains controversial whether PD-L1 is prognostic in NSCLC. We assessed the prognostic value of PD-L1 IHC and its predictive role for adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC. Patients and methods: Tumor sections from three pivotal adjuvant chemotherapy trials (IALT, JBR.10, CALGB 9633) using the E1L3N antibody were studied in this pooled analysis. PD-L1 staining intensity and percentage in both tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells (ICs) were scored by two pathologists. The average or consensus PD-L1 expression levels across intensities and/or percent cells stained were correlated with clinicopathological and molecular features, patient survivals and potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. Results: Results from 982 patients were available for analysis. Considering staining at any intensities for overall PD-L1 expression, 314 (32.0%), 204 (20.8%) and 141 (14.3%) tumor samples were positive for PD-L1 staining on TCs using cut-offs at ≥1%, ≥10% and ≥25%, respectively. For PD-L1 expressing ICs, 380 (38.7%), 308 (31.4%) and 148 (15.1%) were positive at ≥ 1%, ≥10% and 25% cut-offs, respectively. Positive PD-L1 was correlated with squamous histology, intense lymphocytic infiltrate, and KRAS but not with TP53 mutation. EGFR mutated tumors showed statistically non-significant lower PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression was neither prognostic with these cut-offs nor other exploratory cut-offs, nor were predictive for survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. PD-L1 IHC is not a prognostic factor in early stage NSCLC patients.  It is also not predictive for adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in these patients."

In another approach, the immune system is forced or accelerated to attack the tumor through augmentation of the antitumor response against mutations carried by each lung tumor. This latter approach has become feasible since the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, which allows identification of the specific mutations that each individual lung tumor bears. Indeed lung cancers are now known to have high  mutation rates, making them logical targets for mutation-directed immune therapies.

In this review article, we aim to discuss the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies in GI cancers, including gastric, esophageal and colorectal cancer in published or reported recent studies. SCOPE: A literature search was made from PubMed and ASCO Annual Meeting abstracts by using the following search keywords: nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, GI cancers anti-PD1 therapy and anti-PD-L1 therapy. The last search was on  2 November 2016. The most important limitation of our review is that most of the  data on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies in GI cancers relies on phase 1 and 2 trials. FINDINGS: Currently, there are two anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and one anti-PDL1 (atezolizumab) agents approved by FDA. After the treatment efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade was shown in melanoma, renal cell cancer and non-squamous lung cancer, trials which evaluate immune checkpoint blockade in GI  cancers are ongoing. Early results of trials have been promising and encouraging  for patients with advanced stage gastroesophageal cancer. According to early results of published trials, response to anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents appears to be associated with tumor PD-L1 levels. According to two recently published phase 2 trials, the clinical benefits of immune checkpoint blockade with both nivolumab and pembrolizumab were limited in patients with microsatellite instability (MSI)  positive advanced colorectal cancer. However, several phase 2/3 trials are still  ongoing. CONCLUSION: Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab show promising efficacy with acceptable safety data in published trials in GI cancers, especially in refractory MSI positive metastatic colorectal cancer."

Historically, survival for NSCLC with symptomatic BrM was weeks to months. Now, many patients are surviving years with limited data to guide treatment decisions. Tumors with activating mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRact+) have a higher incidence of BrM, but a longer overall survival. The high response rate of both systemic and BrM EGFRact+ NSCLC  to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has led to the rapid incorporation of new therapies but is outpacing evidence-based decisions for BrM in NSCLC. While whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) was the foundation of management of BrM, extended  survival raises concerns for the subacute and late effects radiotherapy. We favor the use of TKIs and delaying the use of WBRT when able. At inevitable disease progression, we consider alternative dosing schedules to increase CNS penetration (such as pulse dosing of erlotinib) or advance to next generation TKI if available. We utilize local control options of surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for symptomatic accessible lesions based on size and edema. At progression despite available TKIs, we use pemetrexed-based platinum doublet chemotherapy or immunotherapy if the tumor has high expression of PDL-1. We reserve the use of WBRT for patients with more than 10 BrM and progression despite TKI and conventional chemotherapy, if performance status is appropriate."

Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), a ligand to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), is expressed by many cancer cells and the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 results in the suppression of T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells.

In total, 161 paired primary and metastatic tumour tissues from 146 patients with pADC were collected. Most of the cases had regional nodal metastasis (134/161, 83.2%). PD-L1 expression was categorised based on the proportion of immunostained tumour cells using cutoff values of 1%, 5%, 10% and 50%. In primary tumours, PD-L1 positivity was observed  in 28.1% (41/146), 27.4% (40/146), 22.6% (33/146) and 13.0% (19/146) of cases using cutoff values of 1%, 5%, 10% and 50%, respectively. The overall concordance rate for PD-L1 expression between primary and metastatic tumours was 75.2% (121/161). The concordance rate in primary tumours expressing PD-L1 in <1% or ≥50% of tumour cells was 87.2% (102/117) or 70% (14/20), respectively. In contrast, the concordance rate in tumours expressing PD-L1 in ≥1% to <50% of cells was only 20.8% (5/24). After dichotomising the cases using cutoff values of 1% and 50%, the concordance rate increased to 80.1% (129/161) and 90.7% (146/161) in all paired cases and to 70.4% (19/27) and 85.2% (23/27) in cases with distant  metastases, respectively. This study demonstrates that the concordance of PD-L1 expression between primary and metastatic pADC is high when using cutoff values of 1% and 50%. Thus, evaluation of PD-L1 in either primary or metastatic tumours  would be helpful for guiding anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in patients with advanced pADC."

Areas covered: Almost all patients treated with EGFR TKIs eventually develop acquired resistance. It has been reported that activation of the oncogenic EGFR pathway enhances susceptibility of the lung tumors to PD-1 blockade in mouse model, suggesting combination of PD1 blockade with EGFR TKIs may be a promising therapeutic strategy. Nivolumab combined with erlotinib was associated with 19% of grade 3 toxicities. The combination of osimertinib plus durvalumab in pretreated or chemo naïve NSCLC patients showed encouraging clinical activity, however, this combination was associated with high incidence of interstitial lung disease (38%), leading to termination of further enrollment. The combination of gefitinib plus durvalumab demonstrated encouraging activity but higher incidence  of grade 3/4 liver enzyme elevation (40-70%). The treatment related Grade 3-4 adverse events were observed in 39% of patients when treated with atezolizumab plus erlotinib. Expert opinion: Given the relatively high incidence of treatment-related toxicities associated with combination of EGFR TKI and immunotherapy, further development of this approach remains controversial. Until  now, the combination of EGFR TKI and immunotherapy should be investigational."

The success of this therapy is based on the fact that upon light microscopy, many solid tumors harbor lymphocytic cells infiltrating the tumor (TILs), and in many solid tumors, the presence of these TILs are prognostic. Ipilimumab was the first monoclonal antibody developed against a target present on T cells after becoming activated, CTLA-4. In malignant melanoma, ipilimumab showed its beneficial effect as compared to a placebo peptide. However, the therapy with this antibody harbors significant toxicity. Meanwhile, other targets such as PD-1, also expressed on (late) activated T cells, were identified, and therapies with antibodies inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 are less toxic. Although these antibodies show response only in a minority of patients, the benefit seems durable in some of these patients. In solid tumors such as melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), treatment with PD-1 inhibitors has resulted in a significant prolongation of survival, even in first-line treatment. As these drugs have been approved in many indications, it is important to know the drugs and side effects. Resistance towards these drugs are caused by low expression of the natural ligand, PD-L1, in the tumor tissue, as well as acquired loss of signal transduction of interferon-related genes such as JAK1 or JAK2, respectively. Also new in cancer therapy are bispecific T cell engager monoclonal antibodies (BiTEs) such as blinatumomab, and autologous chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-Ts). The later have proven their efficacy mainly in hematological neoplasias such as precursor-B-ALL. The dramatic costs of all these new drugs will have an enormous impact on the health care systems in the near future."

In patients with metastatic melanoma treated with ipilimumab, a pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)<5 has been associated with improved survival. This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine whether the pretreatment NLR was associated with outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab. We reviewed the medical records of all patients with previously treated  advanced NSCLC who received nivolumab between March 2015 and March 2016 outside of a clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania. Patients were dichotomized according to pretreatment NLR<5 vs. ≥5. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact of pretreatment NLR on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall response rate (ORR). 175 patients were treated. Median age was 68 (range, 33-88); 54% were female. Twenty-five percent of patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) ≥2; 46% had received ≥2 prior systemic therapies. In multivariate analyses, pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥5 was independently associated with inferior OS (median 5.5 vs. 8.4 months; HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.3-3.3; p=0.002) and inferior PFS (median 1.9 vs. 2.8 months; HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02-2.0; p=0.04). In a cohort of patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab in routine practice, pretreatment NLR≥5 was associated with inferior outcomes. It is unclear whether this marker is predictive or prognostic. Prospective studies are warranted to determine the utility of NLR in the context of other biomarkers of programmed death-1 (PD-1) therapy."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare safety and tolerability between PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and chemotherapy. PubMed and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) databases were searched 1966 to September 2016. Eligible studies included randomized controlled  trials (RCTs) comparing single-agent U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab) with chemotherapy in cancer patients reporting any all-grade (1-4) or high-grade (3-4) adverse events (AEs), all- or high-grade treatment-related symptoms, hematologic  toxicities and immune-related AEs, treatment discontinuation due to toxicities, or treatment-related deaths. The summary incidence, relative risk, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. A total of 3,450 patients from 7 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis: 4 nivolumab, 2 pembrolizumab, and 1 atezolizumab trials. The underlying malignancies included were non-small cell lung cancer (4 trials) and melanoma (3 trials). Compared with chemotherapy, the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had a  significantly lower risk of all- and high-grade fatigue, sensory neuropathy, diarrhea and hematologic toxicities, all-grade anorexia, nausea, and constipation, any all- and high-grade AEs, and treatment discontinuation. There was an increased risk of all-grade rash, pruritus, colitis, aminotransferase elevations, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism, and all- and high-grade pneumonitis with PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are overall better tolerated than chemotherapy. Our results provide further evidence supporting the favorable risk/benefit ratio  for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The Oncologist 2017;22:470-479 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare summary toxicity endpoints and clinically relevant adverse events between programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors and chemotherapy. PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors were associated with a lower risk of treatment-related symptoms (fatigue, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and sensory neuropathy) but a higher risk of immune-related adverse events (AEs). Summary toxicity endpoints favor PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors (any all- and high-grade AEs and treatment discontinuation). PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors are overall better tolerated than chemotherapy. In addition to efficacy data from trials, our findings provide useful information for clinicians for well-balanced discussions  with their patients on the risks and benefits of treatment options for advanced cancer."

Last year, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anti-PD-1 inhibitors for treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma and recently  has approved anti-PD-L1 blocker for treatment of metastatic urothelial cell carcinoma. However, the role that the immune system might have on benign tumours  including vascular anomalies has received less attention. In this study, we evaluated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on two benign vascular anomalies: infantile haemangiomas and venous malformations. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from these two entities were stained for PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies. Blood vessels from normal tissue were used as control. The endothelial cells in both infantile haemangioma  and venous malformation showed high expression of PD-1 but were negative for PD-L1. Endothelial cells within the blood vessels in normal tissues were negative for both PD-1 and PD-L1. Our results showed over-expression of PD-1 in subsets of vascular anomalies, while PD-L1 was negative. This would raise the possibility of immunotherapy in benign vascular tumour when other options are exhausted."

As a result, there has been increased interested in immunotherapy for mesothelioma, both in the first-line and salvage settings. Early investigations of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon alfa-2a/b have been limited by modest response rates and toxicity, whereas cytokine gene therapy is currently being investigated and shows early promise. The most prominent class of immunotherapies to be trialed with mesothelioma in the past half-decade has been immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI). Early results are encouraging, particularly for agents targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways. With the increasing recognition of the immune potential of mesothelioma, interest in the immunomodulatory properties of radiation therapy has emerged. The combination of immunotherapy and radiation therapy may allow for complimentary immunologic effects that can enhance antitumor response.

Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC when genomic testing reveals no targetable alteration such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1 translocation/re-arrangements. But, chemotherapy produces response rates ranging  only between 15-30%. For patients whose disease progresses on first-line chemotherapy, second-line therapy historically consists of taxane-based salvage chemotherapy with a response rate of less than 25%. Recently, immunotherapy with  checkpoint inhibitor agents have demonstrated responses in advanced NSCLC, with some patients exhibiting durable responses after discontinuing therapy. In 2015,  two immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), nivolumab and pembrolizumab were approved for second-line therapy of NSCLC. In 2016, another checkpoint inhibitor targeting program death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), atezolizumab was approved for the same indication. Moreover, pembrolizumab also received approval in 2016 for first-line NSCLC treatment in patients with high PD-L1 expressing tumors. Immunotherapy for NSCLC has therefore, recently evolved  into a true treatment modality with the acceptance of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors as the new standard of care for second-line treatment. However, it is still at the discretion of the treating physician whether to use PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor as data to compare these two pathways is lacking. Focus is now also on exploring  their role in the adjuvant and consolidation settings for NSCLC as well as on exploring novel combinations combining these agents with chemotherapy or radiation. Research is also needed in the development of predictive and prognostic biomarkers for these agents. While vaccine therapy trials in NSCLC have so far failed to show significant clinical benefit, the demonstration of enhanced immune response in these trials suggest the vaccine therapy needs additional evaluation in combination with other therapeutic modalities especially checkpoint inhibition."

Conditional gene deletion showed a cell-intrinsic requirement of CD28 for CD8 T cell proliferation after PD-1 blockade. B7-costimulation was also  necessary for effective PD-1 therapy in tumor-bearing mice. In addition, we found that CD8 T cells proliferating in blood after PD-1 therapy of lung cancer patients were predominantly CD28-positive.

Herein is reported the case of a 51-year-old African-American patient with metastatic biopsy-proven small cell carcinoma of the vagina that progressed  through multiple therapies: first-line cisplatin and etoposide (making it platinum-resistant) and radiotherapy, followed by the tumor macrophage-stimulating agent RRx-001 in a clinical trial called QUADRUPLE THREAT, which per protocol preceded a mandated rechallenge with cisplatin and etoposide.  RECIST v.1.1 tumor progression on both RRx-001 and cisplatin/etoposide was accompanied by central necrosis in several of the enlarged lymph nodes and hepatic metastases, which may have been evidence of pseudoprogression, accounting for her ongoing longer-than-expected survival, since the necrotic tissue may have primed the activity of the PD-1 inhibitor. The lack of response to RRx-001 is hypothesized to have correlated with sparse tumor macrophage infiltration, seen on pre- and post-treatment biopsies, since the mechanism of action of RRx-001 relates to stimulation of tumor-associated macrophages."

However, a systemic immune inflammation is an adverse effect of this therapeutic strategy. In this study, we aimed to identify the possible changes in the tumor microenvironment that contribute to the anti-cancer activity of EGFR inhibition. Squamous-cell cancers were induced by the syngeneic transplantation of either EGFR-null or wild-type mouse primary keratinocytes that had been transduced with an oncogenic H-ras retrovirus. The mice were treated with gefinitib. Then, flow cytometric was used to detect the ratio of T cells and the  expression of programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1). RT-PCR was used to detect  the expression of cytokines and chemokines. Tumors that formed from EGFR-null keratinocytes were smaller, had fewer  infiltrating FoxP3+ Treg cells, lower Foxp3 RNA, and lower percentage of PD-1 positive CD4 cells than those formed from wild-type keratinocytes. These results  indicated that tumor cells can autonomously regulate the tumor microenvironment.  Hosts with wild-type cancers and that were treated with gefitinib for 1 week tended to have smaller tumors. The treated mice in the short-term pharmacological model tended to have reduced FoxP3+ cells and FoxP3 RNA in the tumor microenvironment, as well as a substantially increased ratio of IL-1A/IL-1RA transcripts. These results suggested that the brief systemic inhibition of EGFR signaling alters the immune environment of the targeted cancer. The autonomous (genetic) or systemic (pharmacologic) inhibition of EGFR signaling in tumor cells reduces tumor growth and Treg infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. An EGFR-dependent Treg function supports the growth of squamous cancers. Therefore, Treg is a target in the therapeutic strategy of EGFR inhibition."

MTD was determined with a 3  + 3 dose de-escalation design. Immune marker expression was assessed by flow cytometry.Results: Among 35 patients who initiated ipilimumab, 2 experienced dose-limiting toxicity and 12 (34%) grade 3 toxicity. Response outside the radiation field was assessable in 31 patients. Three patients (10%) exhibited partial response and 7 (23%) experienced clinical benefit (defined as partial response or stable disease lasting ≥6 months). Clinical benefit was associated with increases in peripheral CD8+ T cells, CD8+/CD4+ T-cell ratio, and proportion of CD8+ T cells expressing 4-1BB and PD1. Liver (vs. lung) irradiation produced greater T-cell activation, reflected as increases in the proportions of peripheral T cells expressing ICOS, GITR, and 4-1BB.Combining SABR and ipilimumab was safe with signs of efficacy, peripheral T-cell markers may predict clinical benefit, and systemic immune activation was greater after liver  irradiation."

It is particularly the incidence and mortality regarding females that have increased significantly in recent years. For many years chemotherapeutic treatments of lung cancer were the only way forward in the treatment of patients. In 2015 immunotherapy proved to be a great breakthrough in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), resulting from a new treatment strategy, described as immune checkpoint inhibition. Recent studies have shown the best efficacy of immunotherapy, especially in squamous cell lung cancer and the smoking-related non-squamous cell lung cancer which is explained by research regarding the high occurrence of increased mutation rate caused by smoking. The introduction of immunotherapy carries a great challenge for clinicians regarding the best therapeutic efficacy, longer survival, better quality of life as well as the management of the different profile of side effects. Pembrolizumab was the first PD-1 inhibitor, which was registered for first-line, second-line or greater treatment of non-small cell lung cancer."

However, the extent and knowledge of pulmonary toxicities associated with PD-1 blockade, mainly manifested as pneumonitis, remains obscure. In this study, a total of 6360 subjects from 16 phase II/III clinical trials were pooled for meta-analysis to evaluate the overall incidence and risk of PD-1 inhibitors-related pneumonitis in cancer patients. The incidence of pneumonitis during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy was 2.92% (95%CI: 2.18-3.90%) for all-grade and 1.53% (95%CI: 1.15-2.04%) for high-grade pneumonitis. Compared with routine chemotherapy, PD-1 inhibitors were associated  with a significant increased risk of pneumonitis. Moreover, among the types of tumor treated with PD-1 inhibitors, the melanoma patients have the lowest incidence of pneumonitis, while the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal  cell carcinoma (RCC) patients have the highest. Furthermore, no significant differences were detected in the incidences of all- and high-grade pneumonitis between high-dose and low-dose groups of PD-1 inhibitors. In conclusion, PD-1 inhibitors were probably associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis in a dose-independent manner, compared with routine chemotherapeutic agents. The frequency and severity of treatment-mediated pneumonitis was quite different in patients with various tumor types."

Here, we demonstrated that the M-MDSCs expressing CD11b+CD33+HLA-DR-CD14+ in lung cancer patients after thoractomy significantly increased in comparison with preoperation, and their accumulation linearly correlated with an increase in Treg. Surgery-induced M-MDSCs, in addition to have high arginase activity, were more efficient in suppressing T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, the surgery-induced Treg expressed high levels of Foxp3, PD-1 and CTLA-4. Surgery-induced M-MDSCs were more potent in expending Treg when cocultured with autologous T cells in vitro. Using a lung  metastasis mouse model, we demonstrated that the M-MDSCs at postoperative period  were significantly increased and linearly correlated with Treg. We also showed that all-trans retinoic acid significantly inhibited the induction and proliferation of M-MDSCs, suppressed expansion of Treg, and finally prevented tumor metastasis in the mice after tumor resection. Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed the superiority of surgery-induced M-MDSCs and Treg to those at preoperative period as a prognostic marker for lung cancer patients. Taken together, our results link the presence of surgery-induced M-MDSCs with the emergence of Treg and identify M-MDSCs and Treg derived postoperatively as potential indicators of tumor metastasis."

Programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD1/PD-L1) are promising immunotherapy targets and its expression may be an important biomarker of predicting clinical response. In this study, we evaluated  PD-L1 expression in conjunction with clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes in resected lung adenocarcinoma. This study included 133 cases of lung adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 expression rate in lung adenocarcinoma was 16.5% at the mRNA level and 13.5% at the protein  level, and the kappa coefficient of the two examination methods was 0.824 (P = 0.219, highly correlated). PD-L1 was highly expressed in male patients and smokers with lung adenocarcinoma (P = 0.019 and 0.002, respectively), while no associations were identified between PD-L1 expression and age, tumor size, clinical stage, positive pleural invasion, lymph node metastasis, or therapy methods. Overexpression of PD-L1 was a significant indicator of shorter recurrence free survival time and overall survival (P = 0.000 and 0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that PD-L1 expression was an independent risk factor for poor recurrence free survival and overall survival (P = 0.009 and 0.016, respectively). Expression of PD-L1 was examined with immunohistochemistry, using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) rabbit monoclonal antibody. mRNA levels of PD-L1 were evaluated using in situ hybridization. PD-L1 overexpression is more frequently observed in male patients and smokers in lung adenocarcinoma.

Clinical success of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has spurred interest in applying ICIs targeting CTLA4, PD1 or IDO1 against GBM. This amplifies the need to ascertain GBM's intrinsic susceptibility (or resistance) toward these ICIs, through clinical biomarkers that may also guide and prioritize preclinical testing. Here, we interrogated the TCGA and/or REMBRANDT human patient-cohorts to predict  GBM's predisposition toward ICIs. We exploited various broad clinical biomarkers, including mutational or predicted-neoantigen burden, pre-existing or basal levels of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), differential expression of immune-checkpoints within the tumor and their correlation with particular TILs/Treg-associated functional signature and prognostic impact of differential immune-checkpoint expression. Based on these analyses, we found that predictive biomarkers of ICI responsiveness exhibited inconsistent patterns in GBM patients, i.e., they either predicted ICI resistance (as compared with typical ICI-responsive cancer-types like melanoma, lung cancer or bladder cancer) or susceptibility to therapeutic targeting of CTLA4 or IDO1. On the other hand, our  comprehensive literature meta-analysis and preclinical testing of ICIs using an orthotopic GL261-glioma mice model, indicated significant antitumor properties of anti-PD1 antibody, whereas blockade of IDO1 or CTLA4 either failed or provided very marginal advantage.

Fifty-eight patients (30 females) commenced therapy in the period June-August 2015. Median age was 64.6 years (range 32.3-88.2). Twenty-four patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 32 adenocarcinoma, 38 had received two or more prior lines of therapy. Fourteen cases (24%) were in ECOG PS 2. After a medium observation time of 14.3 months, 13 (22%) are still in treatment. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 4.0 months, 34% were off treatment during the first two months.

Treatment is generally well tolerated although immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can occur. Autoimmune thyroid dysfunction is among the most common irAE, but an assessment of the clinical, mechanistic, and immunologic features has not been previously described. Patient and methods: Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pembrolizumab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (n = 51) as  part of KEYNOTE-001 (NCT01295827) were included. Thyroid function test and anti-thyroid antibodies were assessed prospectively at each study visit, beginning before the first treatment. Frequency of development of thyroid dysfunction, association with anti-thyroid antibodies, clinical course, and relationship with progression-free survival and overall survival to treatment with pembrolizumab was evaluated. Results: Of 51 patients treated, 3 were hypothyroid and 48 were not at baseline.  Ten of 48 [21%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10% to 35%] patients developed thyroid dysfunction requiring thyroid replacement. Anti-thyroid antibodies were present in 8 of 10 patients who developed thyroid dysfunction, compared with 3 of 38 who did not (80% versus 8%, P < 0.0001). Thyroid dysfunction occurred early (median, 42 days) in the pembrolizumab course, and a majority (6 of 10 patients)  experienced brief, transient hyperthyroidism preceding the onset of hypothyroidism; no persistent hyperthyroidism occurred. Both hyperthyroidism and  hypothyroidism were largely asymptomatic. Overall survival with pembrolizumab was significantly longer in subjects who developed thyroid dysfunction (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI 0.09-0.94; P = 0.04). Thyroid dysfunction during pembrolizumab treatment of NSCLC is common and is characterized by early-onset, frequently preceded by transient hyperthyroidism, closely associated with anti-thyroid antibodies, and may be associated with improved outcomes. The presence of antibody-mediated toxicity in  T-cell-directed therapy suggests an under-recognized impact of PD-1 biology in modulating humoral immunity."

We have examined the evolving landscape of tumor neoantigens during the emergence of acquired resistance in patients with non-small cell lung cancer after initial response to  immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Analyses of matched pretreatment and resistant tumors identified genomic changes  resulting in loss of 7 to 18 putative mutation-associated neoantigens in resistant clones. Peptides generated from the eliminated neoantigens elicited clonal T-cell expansion in autologous T-cell cultures, suggesting that they generated functional immune responses. Neoantigen loss occurred through elimination of tumor subclones or through deletion of chromosomal regions containing truncal alterations, and was associated with changes in T-cell receptor clonality. These analyses provide insight into the dynamics of mutational landscapes during immune checkpoint blockade and have implications for the development of immune therapies that target tumor neoantigens.Significance: Acquired resistance to immune checkpoint therapy is being recognized more commonly. This work demonstrates for the first time that acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade can arise in association with the evolving landscape of mutations, some of which encode tumor neoantigens recognizable by T cells. These observations imply that widening the breadth of neoantigen reactivity may mitigate the development of acquired resistance."

Immune checkpoint blockade has been approved in advanced melanoma, renal cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, relapsed refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma, and urothelial cancer. Though FDA-approved indications for use of some of these novel agents depend on current  protein-based programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) assays, detection methods come with several caveats. Additional predictive tools  must be interrogated to discern responders from non-responders. Some of these include measurement of microsatellite instability, PD-L1 amplification, cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) infiltrate density, and tumor mutational burden. This  review serves to synthesize biomarker detection at the DNA, RNA, and protein level to more accurately forecast benefit from these novel agents."

The aim of this study was to determine PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 gene expression at the mRNA level in tumoral tissue from patients with NSCLC and analyze their possible relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics  and their potential prognostic role. PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 expression levels were analyzed using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in fresh-frozen tumor and normal adjacent lung tissue samples from 78 patients with  NSCLC. Later, a significant association between mRNA levels, clinicopathologic characteristics, and patient's survival was assessed. No significant correlation between gene expression levels and sex, age,  histological type, smoking status, pathologic stage, or tumor differentiation was found. However, higher levels of PD-1 were significantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with NSCLC, and PD-L1 overexpression was associated with a  worse prognosis in stage I patients and in Grade 1 to 2 tumors. CONCLUSION: Alterations in PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 expression in lung tumoral tissue seem not to be related to age, sex, smoking status, histological type, pathological stage, or tumor differentiation degree.

Area covered: This review highlights the results of recent clinical studies of single  or combination checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The authors discuss pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab, durvalumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab, nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab for NSCLC as well as nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab for SCLC. Expert opinion: Available data suggest that,  in both metastatic NSCLC and SCLC, combined PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade may produce  a higher tumor response rate than PD-1 blockade alone. Nevertheless, combination  therapy is associated with an increased toxicity. Several larger-scale studies are currently ongoing. For checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in SCLC and NSCLC,  combination therapy is associated with a higher incidence of toxicities than single therapy; however, it appears to help increase tumor response rate. The increased response rate, if confirmed in larger scale studies, will likely make combination therapy another useful therapeutic approach for lung cancer."

Fighting cancer with immunotherapy has revolutionized treatment for some patients and therapies targeting the immune checkpoint molecules such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 have achieved durable responses in melanoma, renal cancer, Hodgkin's diseases and lung cancer. However, the success rate of these treatments has been low and a large number of cancers, including colorectal cancer remain largely refractory to CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade. This has provided impetus to identify other co-inhibitory receptors that could be exploited to enhance response rates of current immunotherapeutic agents and achieve responses to the cancers that are refectory to immunotherapy. Tim-3 is a co-inhibitory receptor that is expressed on IFN-g-producing T cells, FoxP3+ Treg cells and innate immune cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) where it has been shown to suppress their responses upon interaction with their ligand(s). Tim-3 has gained prominence as a potential candidate for cancer immunotherapy, where it has been shown that in vivo blockade of Tim-3 with other check-point inhibitors enhances anti-tumor immunity and suppresses tumor growth in several preclinical tumor models.

One approach to immunotherapy is immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as blockage of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1. This special report aims to describe the state of clinical trials of  tremelimumab in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma (MM) in particular with regard to the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability. Criticism and perspective of this treatment are also discussed. Biological and clinical considerations rule out the use of tremelimumab as single agent for MM and, more generally, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors for MM is still largely questionable and not supported by evidences."

Pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and ipilimumab are approved for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (pembrolizumab and  nivolumab), metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (pembrolizumab and nivolumab), advanced renal cell carcinoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma (nivolumab). Atezolizumab is approved for urothelial carcinoma. These agents function as immune checkpoint inhibitors, activating T-cell-mediated antitumor immune responses through the inhibition of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been reported to cause irdAEs, including rash, pruritus, and vitiligo, requiring an interdisciplinary approach to avoid dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment and to maintain quality of life. Advanced care providers and nurses play a critical role in the attribution, grading, and management of these untoward events and must be knowledgeable about their pathophysiology, incidence, assessment, and clinical presentation."

Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features are poorly described. Methods Patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 mAb were identified at two institutions (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center: advanced solid cancers, 2009 to 2014, and Melanoma Institute of Australia: melanomas only, 2013 to 2015). Pneumonitis was diagnosed by the treating investigator; cases with confirmed malignant lung infiltration or infection were excluded. Clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features of pneumonitis were collected. Associations among pneumonitis incidence, therapy received, and underlying malignancy were examined with Fisher's exact test as were associations between pneumonitis features and outcomes. Results Of 915 patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs, pneumonitis  developed in 43 (5%; 95% CI, 3% to 6%; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 27 of 578 [5%]; Melanoma Institute of Australia, 16 of 337 [5%]). Time to onset of pneumonitis ranged from 9 days to 19.2 months. The incidence of pneumonitis was higher with combination immunotherapy versus monotherapy (19 of 199 [10%] v 24 of 716 [3%]; P < .01). Incidence was similar in patients with melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (overall, 26 of 532 [5%] v nine of 209 [4%]; monotherapy, 15 of 417 v five of 152 [ P = 1.0]; combination, 11 of 115 v four of 57 [ P = .78]). Seventy-two percent (31 of 43) of cases were grade 1 to 2, and 86% (37 of 43) improved/resolved with drug holding/immunosuppression. Five patients worsened clinically and died during the course of pneumonitis treatment; proximal cause of death was pneumonitis (n = 1), infection related to immunosuppression (n = 3), or progressive cancer (n = 1). Radiologic and pathologic features of pneumonitis were diverse. Conclusion Pneumonitis associated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs is a toxicity of variable onset and clinical, radiologic, and pathologic appearances. It is more common when anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs are combined with anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 mAb. Most events are low grade and improve/resolve with drug holding/immunosuppression. Rarely, pneumonitis worsens despite immunosuppression, and may result in infection and/or death."

It has demonstrated efficacy in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. This analysis assessed the immunogenicity  of nivolumab and its impact on pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in patients with solid tumors enrolled in 6 clinical studies. The incidence and prevalence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were determined by validated electrochemiluminescence  assays in samples collected during nivolumab treatment and up to 100 days after the last dose. Confirmed positive samples from the 6 studies were also tested for presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Among 1086 nivolumab-treated patients, 138 patients (12.7%) were ADA positive (relative to baseline), only 3 (0.3%) of whom were persistently positive for ADA, and 9 (0.8%) were NAb positive at 1 time point. The presence of ADAs was not associated with hypersensitivity, infusion reactions, or loss of efficacy and had minimal impact on nivolumab clearance. Additionally, the presence of NAbs was not associated with loss of efficacy. In conclusion, immunogenicity of nivolumab is not clinically meaningful."

In addition, donor CMV seropositivity is an independent risk factor for renal graft loss. The  anti-CMV response might modulate this risk. Expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a receptor involved in viral-specific T-cell exhaustion, is influenced by a single nucleotide polymorphism called PD-1.3 (wild-type allele G, variant allele A). We performed a retrospective study to assess the impact of PD-1.3 on graft outcome in donor CMV seropositive (D+) and donor CMV seronegative (D-) KTx  and LTx. We also performed a case-control study to evaluate the anti-CMVpp65 response according to genotype. PD-1.3 was determined in 1,119 KTx and 181 LTx. In 481 D+ KTx, A allele  carriers (24%) experienced significantly less graft failure compared with GG carriers (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that this association was independent of donor and recipient age, acute rejection episodes, and number of human leukocyte antigen mismatches (hazard ratio, 0.381; 95% confidence interval, 0.209-0.696; p = 0.002). Analysis in 85 D+ LTx showed similar results: A allele carriers had better survival (hazard ratio, 0.302; 95% confidence interval, 0.128-0.716; p = 0.006) and greater 6-month forced expiratory volume (71% ± 17% vs 54% ± 16%, p = 0.001). In D- recipients, PD-1.3 did not affect KTx or LTx outcome. Finally, AA recipients had a stronger anti-CMVpp65 T-cell response than  matched GG recipients (p = 0.003). The A variant allele in PD-1.3 single nucleotide polymorphism improved graft survival in kidney and lung transplant recipients receiving grafts from CMV-positive donors."

However, many questions remain in the role and safety in previously-treated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis incorporating all available evidences to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody compared with chemotherapy. PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library database were searched for the studies about the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody in previously-treated, progressive NSCLC patients. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody with conventional chemotherapy in NSCLC were included. Overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat population was the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes were: progression-free survival (PFS) in  the intention-to-treat population, objective response rate (ORR), the incidence of adverse events, OS and PFS in different PD-L1 expression subgroups. Four trials with a total of 2,174 patients were included. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody showed a significant benefit to OS in the intention-to-treat population [combined hazard ratio (HR) 0.67; 95% CI: 0.61-0.75, P<0.00001], a 33% reduction in the relative risk of death. PFS also favored anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody (HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95, P=0.009). The ORR was significantly higher with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody than those with chemotherapy (RR of nonresponse, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.89-0.95, P<0.00001). Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody was associated with greater efficacy than chemotherapy across the end points of OS and PFS when tumor PD-L1 expression scored ≥1%, ≥5%,  and ≥50%, except for tumor PD-L1 expression scored <1%. The group receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody had lower rates of treatment-related adverse events of any grade (RR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.73-0.81, P<0.00001) and treatment-related adverse events of grade 3-5 (RR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.14-0.41, P<0.00001). Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody significantly improved survival compared with chemotherapy in previously-treated, progressive NSCLC patients. Besides, it  also had a better safety profile."

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major component of the extracellular matrix, and elevated HA levels with a concurrent increase in malignant properties are associated with MPM. We evaluated the effects of trametinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, and 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), an HA synthesis inhibitor, alone and in combination on MPM cells in vitro and in vivo. We studied the effects of trametinib, 4-MU, and their combination on MPM cells by using cell viability assays, Western blot analysis, and a mouse xenograft model. Trametinib and 4-MU exhibited antiproliferative activity in MPM cells. Trametinib blocked MEK-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and decreased CD44 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Trametinib inhibited the expression of Fra-1 (the activator protein 1 [AP1] component), inhibited ERK phosphorylation, and decreased CD44 expression. 4-MU inhibited ERK phosphorylation but not CD44 expression. In a mouse xenograft  model, trametinib and 4-MU alone suppressed tumor growth compared with a control. The combination had a greater inhibitory effect than either monotherapy. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that trametinib treatment alone significantly reduced expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1. Furthermore, the combination of trametinib and 4-MU resulted in higher expression of programmed cell death 1 and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 than did the 4-MU treatment alone. Our results suggest that trametinib and 4-MU are promising therapeutic agents in MPM and that further study of the combination is warranted."

PD-L1 expression was evaluated in resected stage II and III ADCs by using various cutoffs and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters and survival. PD-L1 expression was also compared between the primary tumor and lymph  node metastases. There were 109 study cases. PD-L1 expression was seen in 56 (51%), 43 (39%), and 19 (17%) when cutoffs of at least 1%, at least 5%, and at least 50%, respectively, were used. Abundant intratumoral CD8-positive T cells were a significant predictor of the expression in the primary tumor, with cutoffs of 1%  and 5% (p < 0.001 for both) by multivariate analysis, whereas they were a nonsignificant predictor of the expression with a 50% cutoff (p = 0.076). PD-L1 expression was concordant between the primary tumor and nodal metastasis in most  of the cases, but it was discrepant in up to 38%. The discrepancy was attributed  in part to different predominant histologic patterns between the primary and metastatic tumors. In the entire cohort, PD-L1 expression with all cutoffs had no bearing on 5-year recurrence-free survival. PD-L1 expression is associated with abundant intratumoral CD8-positive T cells in resected ADCs, suggesting a predictive role of PD-L1 expression in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies; however, the possible intertumoral heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression raises a concern about selecting the most appropriate sample for PD-L1 IHC."

Samples from 90 patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations and treated with first line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) within 3 months of diagnosis were stained for CTLA-4, PD-L1, PD-1, TIM-3 and CD3 expression by immunohistochemistry. PD-L1 was present in at least 1% of immune and tumor cells in 44% and 59% of samples, respectively. In multivariate analysis, increased CD3 immune shaped cell (ISC) counts (HR 2.805, p=0.034) and high PD-L1 tumor H-score (HR 3.805, p=0.022) was associated with a shorter progression free survival and high  CTLA-4 ISC counts was associated with borderline overall survival significance (HR 1.054, p=0.061).

However, the methods and assays for the assessment of PD-L1 using immunohistochemistry are variable and PD-L1 expression appears to be highly heterogeneous. Here, we examine assay heterogeneity parameters toward the goal of determining variability of sampling and the variability due to pathologist-based reading of the immunohistochemistry slide. SP142, a rabbit monoclonal antibody, was used to detect PD-L1 by both chromogenic immunohistochemistry and quantitative immunofluorescence using a laboratory-derived test. Five pathologists scored the  percentage of PD-L1 positivity in tumor- and stromal-immune cells of 35 resected  non-small cell lung cancer cases, each represented on three separate blocks. An intraclass correlation coefficient of 94% agreement was seen among the pathologists for the assessment of PD-L1 in tumor cells, but only 27% agreement was seen in stromal/immune cell PD-L1 expression. The block-to-block reproducibility of each pathologist's score was 94% for tumor cells and 75% among stromal/immune cells. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient between pathologists' readings and the mean immunofluorescence score among blocks was 94% in tumor and 68% in stroma. Pathologists were highly concordant for PD-L1 tumor scoring, but not for stromal/immune cell scoring. Pathologist scores and immunofluorescence scores were concordant for tumor tissue, but not for stromal/immune cells. PD-L1 expression was similar among all the three blocks from each tumor, indicating that staining of one block is enough to represent the entire tumor and that the spatial distribution of heterogeneity of expression of  PD-L1 is within the area represented in a single block. Future studies are needed to determine the minimum representative tumor area for PD-L1 assessment for response to therapy."

On the basis of multidimensional and comprehensive molecular characterization (including DNA methylation and copy, and RNA and protein expression), 1023 NSCLC cases-519 from TCGA adenocarcinoma (AD) project and 504 from TCGA squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) project-were classified  using a 'cluster-of-clusters' analytic approach. Patterns from TCGA NSCLC subsets were examined in independent external databases, including the PROSPECT (Profiling of Resistance patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation  of Cancers of the Thorax) NSCLC data set. Nine genomic subtypes of NSCLC were identified, three within SQCC and six within AD. SQCC subtypes were associated with transcriptional targets of SOX2 or p63. One predominately AD subtype (with a large proportion of SQCC) shared molecular features with neuroendocrine tumors. Two AD subtypes manifested a CpG island methylator phenotype. Three AD subtypes showed high p38 and mTOR pathway activation. AD subtypes associated with low differentiation showed relatively worse prognosis. SQCC subtypes and two of the AD subtypes expressed cancer testis antigen genes, whereas three AD subtypes expressed several immune checkpoint genes including PDL1 and PDL2, corresponding  with patterns of greater immune cell infiltration. Subtype associations for several immune-related markers-including PD1, PDL1, CD3 and CD8-were confirmed in the PROSPECT cohort using immunohistochemistry. NSCLC molecular subtypes have therapeutic implications and lend support to a personalized approach to NSCLC management based on molecular characterization."

In this report, we discuss the clinical history, pathological evaluation, and genomic findings in a  patient with metastatic lung squamous cell cancer (SCC) who developed severe nivolumab-induced pneumonitis preceding durable clinical remission after three doses of nivolumab. CASE PRESENTATION: A patient with chemotherapy-refractory, metastatic lung SCC developed symptomatic pneumonitis by week 4 after nivolumab treatment, concurrently with onset of a potent antitumor response. Despite discontinuation of nivolumab after three doses and the use of high dose oral corticosteroids for  grade 3 pneumonitis, continued tumor response to a complete remission by 3 months was evident by radiographic assessment. At the time of this submission, the patient has remained in clinical remission for 14 months. High PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry staining was seen in intra-alveolar macrophages and viable tumor cells in the pneumonitis and recurrent tumor specimens, respectively. Tumor genomic profiling by FoundationOne targeted exome sequencing  revealed a very high tumor mutation burden (TMB) corresponding to 95-96 percentile in lung SCC, i.e., 87.4-91.0 and 82.9 mut/Mb, respectively, in pre- and post-nivolumab tumor specimens. Except for one, the 13 functional genomic alterations remained the same in the diagnostic, recurrent, and post-treatment, relapsed tumor specimens, suggesting that nivolumab reset the patient's immune system against one or more preexisting tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). One potential TAA candidate is telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in which an oncogenic promoter -146C>T mutation was detected. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing revealed HLA-A*0201 homozygosity, which is the prevalent HLA class I allele that has been used to develop universal cancer vaccine targeting TERT-derived peptides. Nivolumab could quickly reset and sustain host immunity against preexisting TAA(s) in this chemotherapy-refractory lung SCC patient. Further mechanistic studies are needed to characterize the effective immune cells and define the HLA-restricted TAA(s) and the specific T cell receptor clones responsible for the potent antitumor effect, with the aim of developing precision immunotherapy with improved effectiveness and safety."

Initial evidence, for example with combined inhibition of PD-1 and CTLA-4 in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has highlighted the potential to further enhance the clinical benefits of monotherapies by combining agents with synergistic mechanisms of action. In order to address the current progress and consider challenges associated with these novel approaches, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a Combination Immunotherapy Task Force. This Task Force was charged with identifying and prioritizing the most promising  prospects for combinatorial approaches as well as addressing the challenges associated with developing these strategies. As a result of the extensive clinical benefit and tolerable side effects demonstrated with agents inhibiting the PD-1 pathway, an overview of current evidence to support its promising potential for use as a backbone in combination strategies is presented. In addition, key issues in the development of these strategies including preclinical modeling, patient safety and toxicity considerations, clinical trial design, and  endpoints are also discussed.

Blockade of the PD-1-PD-L1/2 inhibitory pathway constitutes a breakthrough for the treatment of NSCLC. Some predictive biomarkers of clinical response to this therapy are starting to emerge, such as PD-L1 expression by tumor/stromal cells and infiltration by CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1. To more effectively integrate all of these potential biomarkers of clinical response to immunotherapy, we have developed a multiparametric immunofluorescence technique with automated immune cell counting to comprehensively analyze the tumor microenvironment of ALK-positive adenocarcinoma (ADC). When analyzed as either a continuous or a dichotomous variable, the mean number of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 (p = 0.012) and the percentage of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 were higher in ALK-positive ADC than in EGFR-mutated ADC or WT (non-EGFR-mutated and non-KRAS-mutated) NSCLC. A very strong correlation between PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and intratumoral infiltration by CD8+ T cells was observed, suggesting that an adaptive mechanism may partly regulate this expression. A higher frequency of tumors combining positive PD-L1 expression and infiltration by intratumoral CD8+  T cells or PD-1+CD8+ T cells was also observed in ALK-positive lung cancer patients compared with EGFR-mutated (p = 0.03) or WT patients (p = 0.012). These  results strongly suggest that a subgroup of ALK-positive lung cancer patients may constitute good candidates for anti-PD-1/-PD-L1 therapies."

In addition, we also found that PD-1 expression showed a high level on lung tumor tissues and adjacent non- tumor tissue infiltrating T cells, and no significant difference was found between the two groups. However PD-L1 on CD45+CD14+mononcytes/macrophages in tumor tissue show a significantly higher level compared with that in adjacent nontumor tissues. In vitro stimulation experiments showed that IFN-γ could significantly increase PD-L1 expression on monocyte.

In addressing this question, we generated a preclinical tumor model to study anti-PD-1 resistance by in vivo passaging of Kras-mutated, p53-deficient murine lung cancer cells (p53R172HΔg/+K-rasLA1/+ ) in a syngeneic host exposed to repetitive dosing with anti-mouse PD-1 antibodies. PD-L1 (CD274) expression did not differ between the resistant and parental tumor cells. However, the expression of important molecules in the antigen presentation pathway, including MHC class I and II, as well as β2-microglobulin, were significantly downregulated in the anti-PD-1-resistant tumors compared with parental tumors. Resistant tumors also contained fewer CD8+ (CD8α) and CD4+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and reduced production of IFNγ. Localized radiotherapy induced IFNβ production, thereby elevating MHC class I expression on both parental and resistant tumor cells and restoring the responsiveness of resistant tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. Conversely, blockade of type I IFN signaling abolished the effect of radiosensitization in this setting. Collectively, these results identify a mechanism of PD-1 resistance and demonstrate that adjuvant radiotherapy can overcome resistance. These findings have immediate clinical implications for extending the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint therapy in patients."

However, the data regarding PD-L1/PD-1 in breast cancer are inconsistent. Given the heterogeneity of breast cancers, the clinical relevance of PD-L1 and PD-1 tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  (TIL) may vary according to subtypes of breast cancer. We aim to investigate PD-L1 expression in a large cohort of breast cancers and analyze its clinico-pathological as well as outcome relationship according to molecular subtypes. Also, we evaluate the relationship of PD-1 TIL and PD-L1 expression with patients' survival, particularly for breast cancers with high TIL. METHODS AND Immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 on tissue arrays for 1091 breast cancer patients and PD-1 TIL on 97 whole sections was performed. Associations of PD-L1 with luminal cancers (p < 0.001) and features associated with that subtype [lower histologic grade, absence of necrosis, ER, PR, and AR expression (p < 0.001)] were observed. However, in HER2+ breast cancers, PD-L1 was an independent poor prognostic indicator (DFS: HR = 1.866, p = 0.001; OS: HR = 1.517, p = 0.036). Interestingly, HER2+ cancers showed a lower PD-1 TIL level compared to the other high TIL cases (p = 0.011). Cases with low PD-TIL but high PD-L1 expression showed the worst survival. This could be indicative of an active immune suppression by PD-L1 expression. Our data showed the relevance of PD-L1 expression in HER2+ breast cancer. A combined evaluation of PD-L1 and PD-1 TIL in the prognosis of breast cancer might also be of value in treatment prediction."

HHLA2 is a newly discovered member of the family. By regulating T-cell function, HHLA2 could contribute to tumor immune suppression and thus be a novel target for cancer immunotherapy. There is limited information and critical need to characterize its expression profile and clinical significance in NSCLC. We performed IHC with an HHLA2-specific antibody (clone 566.1) using tissue microarrays constructed from 679 NSCLC tumor tissues, including 392 cases in the discovery set and 287 cases in the validation cohort.  We also studied clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients. Overall, HHLA2 was not detected in most of normal lung tissue but expressed in 66% of NSCLC across different subtypes. In particular, EGFR-mutated  NSCLC was significantly associated with higher tumor HHLA2 expression in both discovery (EGFR vs. WT: 76% vs. 53%, P = 0.01) and validation cohorts (89% vs. 69%, P = 0.01). In one of the two cohorts, HHLA2 expression was higher in lung adenocarcinoma as compared with squamous and large cell histology, non-Hispanic White versus Hispanics, and tumors with high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)  density. In the multivariate analysis, EGFR mutation status and high TIL intensity were independently associated with HHLA2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma. HHLA2 is widely expressed in NSCLC and is associated with EGFR mutation and high TILs in lung adenocarcinoma. It is potentially a novel target for lung cancer immunotherapy."

Objective: To examine whether PD-L1 antibody reagents are interchangeable by quantitatively comparing the expression of the PD-L1 protein. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this immunohistochemistry standardization study, 30 randomly selected cases of lung cancer resected from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2009, were obtained from Yale Pathology Archives with a range of expression of PD-L1. To test for protein measurement, rather than clinical utility, a PD-L1 index tissue microarray, including cell line and tissue controls, was used. The results were then validated on a commercially available,  genetically defined PD-L1 engineered cell line array with a range of controlled protein-expressing cell lines using 6 monoclonal antibodies (SP142, E1L3N, 9A11,  SP263, 22c3, and 28-8). Protein levels were measured by quantitative immunofluorescence and quantitative chromogenic assessment. Data analysis was performed from September 2015 through May 2016. Results: Concordance between 4 antibodies revealed regression for tumor tissue cores (R2 = 0.42-0.91) and cell line cores (R2 = 0.83-0.97) by quantitative immunofluorescence in the PD-L1 index tissue microarray. All 6 antibodies had high levels of concordance (R2 = 0.76-0.99) when using chromogenic staining in isogenic cell lines. Because the antibodies are highly concordant, these results suggest that assays based on the use of these antibodies could yield concordant results. They further suggest that previously described differences in PD-L1 expression in tissue are independent of the antibody used and likely attributable to tumor heterogeneity, assay- or platform-specific variables, or other factors."

This suggests that a treatment strategy that includes TPP may not benefit the overall population. The risks of TPP should be weighed against the low likelihood of a PR and the potential for changing to a different therapy  with a higher likelihood of benefit."

Renal cell, urothelial, and prostatic carcinoma are the overwhelming subtypes diagnosed by oncologists. Each  of these was traditionally treated surgically when local and non-invasive. When these carcinomas spread, invade, or metastasize, surgical control lacks in efficacy. Chemotherapeutic regimens have been implemented for decades and have increased overall survival but many patients progress. Molecular targeting through tyrosine kinase inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has emerged as a frontline therapy in kidney cancer with more durable responses. More recently, immunotherapy has begun to find efficacy in many other  solid tumors including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. The inherent genetic instability of this group of cancers makes them ideal solid tumors for immune modulation. Vaccines manufactured to initiate T-Cell regulation through neoplastic-antigen presentation are available for prostate cancer and are currently on trial in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are intricate members of cellular immunity against neoplastic  cells. In an activated, unbound state, these molecules permit T-cell activation and cytotoxic killing of cancer cells. However, when they are linked, cellular immunity is attenuated and local cancer cells are permitted the opportunity to proliferate and invade. A novel class of monoclonal antibodies have been developed which stop PD-1 linkage and thus uncouple the 'stop' signal of these neoplastic regulatory cells. The increased overall and progression free survival  have made them attractive options alone as well as in combination with anti-VEGF  inhibitors for patients. Although more tolerable than chemotherapy, immunotherapeutics have adverse potential toxicities. Overall, the use of immunomodulatory medications have opened a new paradigm in the anti-neoplastic regimen of GU cancers and further developments will determine the appropriate patient to treat for optimum tumor burden eradication."

Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 genes were selected and genotyped. A total of 354 patients with early stage NSCLC who underwent curative surgical resection were enrolled. The association of the SNPs with overall survival (OS) was analyzed. Among the 12 SNPs investigated, PD-L1 rs4143815C>G, rs822336G>C, and rs822337T>A were significantly associated with worse survival outcomes in multivariate analyses. When the three SNPs were combined, OS decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the number of bad genotypes increased (Ptrend=0.0003). In the luciferase assay, rs4143815 G allele exhibited a decreased transcription activity compared with C allele (P=0.001), and the rs822336C-rs822337A haplotype  had a decreased promoter activity compared with the rs822336G-rs822337T haplotype (P=0.004). Patients with higher expression of PD-L1 mRNA had a better survival compared with lower expression (P=0.03). PD-L1 polymorphisms may be useful for the prediction of prognosis in patients with surgically resected NSCLC. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to understand the role of PD-L1 in the antitumor immunity and prognosis in NSCLC."

We assessed its efficacy and safety versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (OAK) in 194 academic or  community oncology centres in 31 countries. We enrolled patients who had squamous or non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had received one to two previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (one or more platinum based combination therapies) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease and those who had received  previous treatments with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenously receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel  75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks by permuted block randomisation (block size of eight) via  an interactive voice or web response system. Coprimary endpoints were overall survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1-expression population TC1/2/3  or IC1/2/3 (≥1% PD-L1 on tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells). The primary efficacy analysis was done in the first 850 of 1225 enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02008227. FINDINGS: Between March 11, 2014, and April 29, 2015, 1225 patients were recruited. In the primary population, 425 patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab and 425 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab in the ITT and PD-L1-expression populations. In the ITT population, overall survival was improved with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel (median overall survival was 13·8 months [95% CI 11·8-15·7] vs 9·6 months [8·6-11·2]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·62-0·87], p=0·0003). Overall survival in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population was improved with atezolizumab (n=241) compared with docetaxel (n=222; median overall survival was 15·7 months [95% CI 12·6-18·0] with atezolizumab vs 10·3 months [8·8-12·0] with docetaxel; HR 0·74 [95% CI 0·58-0·93]; p=0·0102). Patients in the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup (TC0 and IC0) also had improved survival with atezolizumab (median overall survival 12·6 months vs 8·9 months; HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·59-0·96]). Overall survival improvement was similar in  patients with squamous (HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·54-0·98]; n=112 in the atezolizumab group and n=110 in the docetaxel group) or non-squamous (0·73 [0·60-0·89]; n=313  and n=315) histology. Fewer patients had treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events with atezolizumab (90 [15%] of 609 patients) versus docetaxel (247 [43%] of 578 patients). One treatment-related death from a respiratory tract infection  was reported in the docetaxel group. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, OAK is the first randomised phase 3 study to report results of a PD-L1-targeted therapy, with atezolizumab treatment resulting in a clinically relevant improvement of overall survival versus docetaxel in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression or  histology, with a favourable safety profile.

In this review, we examine the role of novel active agents for patients who progress after first-line therapy and who are not  candidates for targeted therapies. More therapeutic options are needed for the management of patients with NSCLC after failure of first-line chemotherapy. A PubMed search was performed for articles from January 2012 to May 2015 using the  keywords NSCLC, antiangiogenic, immunotherapy, second-line, novel therapies and English language articles only. Relevant papers were reviewed; papers outside that period were considered on a case-by-case basis. A search of oncology congresses was performed to identify relevant abstracts over this period. In recent years, antiangiogenic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been added to our armamentarium to treat patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed on first-line chemotherapy. These include nintedanib, a triple angiokinase inhibitor; ramucirumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 antibody; and nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, just three of a growing list of antibodies targeting the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/PD  ligand-1 pathway. Predictive and prognostic factors in NSCLC treatment will help  to optimise treatment with these novel agents. The approval of new treatments for patients with NSCLC after the failure of first-line chemotherapy has increased options after a decade of few advances, and holds promise for future evolution of the management of NSCLC."

However, the approval of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has shifted the treatment paradigm and provides hope for improved survival. The ability of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to evade the host immune system can be overcome by agents such as pembrolizumab (MK-3475/lambrolizumab), which is a monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. In early studies, treatment with pembrolizumab led to dramatic and durable responses in select patients (PD-L1+ tumors). This remarkable efficacy lead to approval of pembrolizumab in the second-line setting as response rates were almost doubled compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Most recently, data in the first-line setting from the KEYNOTE-024 study have redefined the SOC therapy for  a selected subset of patients. In patients with ≥50% PD-L1+ tumors, pembrolizumab had a clear progression-free survival and overall survival benefit. Toxicity was  mostly immune related and similar to checkpoint blockade toxicities observed in previous studies. The initial approval and subsequent studies of pembrolizumab required and utilized a companion diagnostic test, Dako's IHC 22C3, to assess PD-L1 status of patients. The evaluation and scoring system of this assay has been used by other companies as a reference to develop their own assays, which may complicate selection of patients. Finally, the impact of pembrolizumab in NSCLC is growing as evidenced by the numerous, ongoing trials open for combinations with chemotherapy, chemoradiation, other immunotherapeutics, immunomodulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Further studies are also evaluating pembrolizumab in small-cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma. This explosion of studies truly conveys the lack of therapeutic answers for lung cancer patients and the promise of pembrolizumab."

We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and immune profiling analyses of a unique set of clinically annotated early-stage LUADs to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease and identify clinically relevant molecular markers. Methods: We performed WES of 108 paired stage I-III LUADs and normal lung tissues using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Ten immune markers (PD-L1, PD-1, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45ro, CD57, CD68, FOXP3 and Granzyme B) were profiled by imaging-based immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a subset of LUADs (n = 92). Associations among mutations, immune markers and clinicopathological variables were analyzed using ANOVA and Fisher's exact test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for multivariate analysis of clinical outcome. Results: LUADs in this cohort exhibited an average of 243 coding mutations. We identified 28 genes with significant enrichment for mutation. SETD2-mutated LUADs exhibited relatively poor recurrence- free survival (RFS) and mutations in STK11  and ATM were associated with poor RFS among KRAS-mutant tumors. EGFR, KEAP1 and PIK3CA mutations were predictive of poor response to adjuvant therapy. Immune marker analysis revealed that LUADs in smokers and with relatively high mutation  burdens exhibited increased levels of immune markers. Analysis of immunophenotypes revealed that LUADs with STK11 mutations exhibited relatively low levels of infiltrating CD4+/CD8+ T-cells indicative of a muted immune response. Tumoral PD-L1 was significantly elevated in TP53 mutant LUADs whereas PIK3CA mutant LUADs exhibited markedly down-regulated PD-L1 expression. LUADs with TP53 or KEAP1 mutations displayed relatively increased CD57 and Granzyme B levels indicative of augmented natural killer (NK) cell infiltration. Conclusion(s): Our study highlights molecular and immune phenotypes that warrant  further analysis for their roles in clinical outcomes and personalized immune-based therapy of LUAD."

In this study, we analyzed PD-L1 protein expression in lung cancer cell lines with EGFR mutations prior to and after acquisition of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We found that parental lung cancer cell lines harboring EGFR mutations showed negative (PC9 and H3255 cells) and positive (HCC827 cells) staining for PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry. Comparing PD-L1 expression between EGFR-TKI resistant cell lines and their parental cells, we found that increased phosphorylation of EGFR was related to increased expression  of PD-L1. Increased phosphorylation of EGFR was accompanied by the T790M secondary mutation. Acquired resistance cells with MET amplification or EGFR loss both showed decreased phosphorylation of EGFR and decreased PD-L1 expression. Our results indicate that lung cancer cell lines with EGFR mutations (parental cells) do not harbor high PD-L1 protein expression. In addition, EGFR phosphorylation affects PD-L1 expression after acquisition of resistance to EGFR-TKIs."

This is a mixed population including patients who have far more extensive and bulky disease than others. Management of these patients continue to be a challenge; frequently, patients have both local recurrence and distant metastases in this stage and the prognosis is very poor with a 5-year overall survival estimated between 3% and 7% for inoperable disease. The standard treatment for these patients is concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) improving survival when compared to sequential combination as shown in several metanalysis. Recently, immune-therapies, including checkpoint inhibitor, such as monoclonal antibodies against programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), have shown to enhance survival compared to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The integration of radiotherapy with immunotherapy is a conceptually promising strategy and several preclinical experiments have further  developed the rationale for combining them.

Current patient selection is based on PD-L1 expression, using the relevant companion diagnostic test, where patients with strong PD-L1 expression being more likely to respond to these novel agents. Ongoing clinical research focuses on the development of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy in neoadjuvant and adjuvant NSCLC. There is also much interest in using these drugs as a therapeutic backbone for rational combinations with other treatment modalities including cytotoxic chemotherapies in the first-line NSCLC, other immunotherapies such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 antagonists, molecularly targeted agents including EGFR and ALK inhibitors, and radiotherapy. Concurrent treatment with radiotherapy is of particular interest owing to the potential for the abscopal effect, using radiotherapy to facilitate systemic treatment."

ICBs targeting the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) have recently been investigated in a number of advanced tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 kappa directed against PD-1, has been the  first ICB to be approved for second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. Areas covered: In this review we focus on the clinical development of nivolumab for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, with an emphasis on its safety profile. In addition, we summarize the most common types of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab, mainly due to organ inflammation secondary to autoimmunity. Expert opinion: Nivolumab is the preferred treatment option for platinum-pretreated advanced NSCLC, having convincingly shown higher efficacy compared with standard docetaxel chemotherapy in phase III trials. The same trials showed far less incidence of either any grade and severe treatment-related AEs with nivolumab compared with chemotherapy. IrAEs associated with nivolumab are rarely severe in intensity, and often resolve with prompt management. Future  studies will explore nivolumab in combination strategies with either platinum-based chemotherapy or other ICBs in treatment-naïve advanced NSCLC patients."

Expert commentary: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies offer several advantages including significant antitumor activity, induction of long lasting responses, and favorable safety profile. Several trials are now being conducted to evaluate their efficacy as first line agents as well as in combination with other agents. More research is also needed to identify other biomarkers, in addition to PD-L1 expression, that could more reliably predict response to these  drugs, and aid in better patient selection."

The VHL/HIF/VEGF pathway thus plays a major role in angiogenesis and is currently targeted by anti-angiogenic therapy. The emergence of resistance is leading to the use of targeted immunotherapy against immune checkpoint PD1/PDL1 that restores antitumor immune response. The correlation between VHL status and PD-L1  expression has been little investigated. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 98 consecutive cases of ccRCC and correlated PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with clinical data (up to 10-year follow-up), pathological criteria, VEGF, PAR-3, CAIX and PD-1 expressions by IHC and complete VHL status (deletion, mutation and promoter hypermethylation). PD-L1 expression was observed in 69 ccRCC (70.4%) and the corresponding patients had a worse prognosis, with a median specific survival of 52 months (p = 0.03). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with poor prognostic factors such as a higher ISUP nucleolar grade (p = 0.01), metastases at diagnosis (p = 0.01), a sarcomatoid component (p = 0.04), overexpression of VEGF (p = 0.006), and cytoplasmic PAR-3 expression (p = 0.01). PD-L1 expression was also associated with dense PD-1 expression (p = 0.007) and with ccRCC with 0 or 1 alteration(s) (non-inactivated VHL tumors; p = 0.007) that remained significant after multivariate analysis (p = 0.004 and p = 0.024, respectively). Interestingly, all wild-type VHL tumors (no VHL gene alteration, 11.2%) expressed PD-L1. In this study, we found PD-L1 expression to be associated with noninactivated VHL tumors  and in particular wild-type VHL ccRCC, which may benefit from therapies inhibiting PD-L1/PD-1."

Treatment with  such immune checkpoint inhibitors is associated with a unique pattern of immune-related adverse events or side effects. Combination approaches involving CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy or radiotherapy are being investigated to determine whether they may enhance the efficacy of treatment.

PET imaging was used to evaluate the whole-body distribution of 89Zr-deferoxamine (Df)-pembrolizumab in two rodent models (mice and rats). Data obtained from PET scans and biodistribution studies were extrapolated to humans to estimate the dosimetry of the tracer. As a proof of concept, the biodistribution of 89Zr-Df-pembrolizumab was further investigated in a humanized murine model. The tracer remained stable in blood circulation throughout the study and accumulated the greatest in liver and spleen tissues. Both mice and rats showed similar biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 89Zr-Df-pembrolizumab. In the humanized mouse model, T-cell infiltration into the salivary and lacrimal glands  could be successfully visualized. CONCLUSION: These data will augment our understanding of the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of radiolabeled pembrolizumab in vivo, while providing detailed dosimetry data that may lead to better dosing strategies in the future. These findings further demonstrate the utility of noninvasive in vivo PET imaging to dynamically track T-cell checkpoint receptor expression and localization in a humanized mouse model."

Many reports have described the clinical effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), supporting their utility as a promising therapy that will achieve prominent effects even in  patients resistant to cytotoxic anticancer drugs or gene-targeting therapy. ICIs  may also prolong overall survival. We analyzed 10 cases of advanced lung cancer targeted with nivolumab, which is one of ICIs in our hospital and reviewed the literature regarding ICIs. We retrospectively analyzed 10 cases that consisted of 6 males and 4 females, which comprised 7 adenocarcinomas, 2 squamous cell carcinomas and one pleomorphic carcinoma. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations were negative in all the adenocarcinoma  cases. The 10 analyzed cases included 9 inoperable cases and 1 postoperative recurrent case, 8 second-line cases, a third-line case, and a fourth-line case. The average frequency of administrations of nivolumab was 7.4 times. The survival rate was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical responses to nivolumab were partial response in 2 cases, stable disease in 4 cases, and progressive disease in 4 cases. In the 10 cases, the response rate and disease control rate were 20% and 60%, respectively. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 115 days and 126 days, respectively. We observed 2 cases of dermatitis and one each of pyrexia, general fatigue and drug-induced pneumonia as adverse events (AEs). One of these AEs was severe (Stevens-Johnson syndrome grade 4) but could be treated by steroid pulse therapy, steroid ointment and instillation. Among the 10 examined cases of advanced lung cancer treated with ICIs at our hospital, ICIs proved effective in 2 cases. However, we also experienced a case with Stevens-Johnson syndrome grade 4 as a severe AE. These findings suggest that while ICIs may be effective in treating patients, candidates for ICIs must be carefully selected and cautiously observed."

We also describe current areas of research in immunotherapy, and highlight ongoing trials and promising and novel investigational agents. Data were obtained by a search of PubMed®, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane databases for English language articles published through February 2016. Applicable abstracts from recent Society of Urologic Oncology, European Association of Urology, American Urological Association and ASCO® meetings were used. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin is one of the most successful immunotherapies in cancer treatment and remains the gold standard of care for patients with high  risk, nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, with initial response rates of approximately 70%. However, with the exception of valrubicin and standard chemotherapeutics there is a paucity of available treatment options for patients  with recurrence or progression to more advanced disease. Recently there has been  significant interest in novel immunotherapeutic agents in the management of cases where bacillus Calmette-Guérin fails, as well as cases of more advanced cancer. These investigational therapies can generally be classified into several broad categories, including recombinant bacillus Calmette-Guérin and cell wall derived  therapies, cytokines, gene therapy, cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, oncolytic viruses, adoptive immunotherapies and immune agonists, as well as several additional immunomodulatory agents. The majority of these agents  are currently under investigation in phase I or II clinical trials. Recently investigators reported evidence that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has clinical activity in patients with advanced bladder cancer. These findings, along with successful phase III trials and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals  of other checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma, nonsmall cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma, ultimately led to Food and Drug Administration approval of atezolizumab for advanced disease, the first new treatment approved for advanced  urothelial carcinoma in 20 years. While bacillus Calmette-Guérin has demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with bladder cancer, additional therapies are needed for those in whom bacillus Calmette-Guérin fails, as well as for those with advanced disease. Immunotherapy for urothelial carcinoma remains a promising and active area of research, and numerous agents, particularly the monoclonal antibodies targeting checkpoint inhibition pathways, are showing encouraging signs of clinical activity."

We assessed the safety and activity of combination nivolumab plus ipilimumab as first-line therapy for NSCLC. The open-label, phase 1, multicohort study (CheckMate 012) cohorts reported here were enrolled at eight US academic centres. Eligible patients were  aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent stage IIIb or stage IV, chemotherapy-naive NSCLC. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by an interactive voice response system to receive nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 12 weeks, or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks  plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Data from the latter two cohorts, which were considered potentially suitable for further clinical development, are presented in this report; data from the other cohort (as well as several earlier  cohorts) are described in the appendix. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability, assessed in all treated patients. This ongoing study is registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01454102. FINDINGS: Between May 15, 2014, and March 25, 2015, 78 patients were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab every 12 weeks (n=38) or nivolumab every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab every 6 weeks (n=40). One patient in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort was excluded before treatment; therefore 77 patients actually received treatment (38 in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort; 39 in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort). At data cut-off on Jan 7, 2016, 29 (76%) patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 32 (82%) in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort had discontinued treatment. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (37%) patients in the ipilimumab  every-12-weeks cohort and 13 (33%) patients in the every-6-weeks cohort; the most commonly reported grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased lipase (three [8%] and no patients), pneumonitis (two [5%] and one [3%] patients), adrenal insufficiency (one [3%] and two [5%] patients), and colitis (one [3%] and two [5%] patients). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 12 (32%) patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 11 (28%) patients in the every-6-weeks cohort. Treatment-related adverse events (any grade) prompted treatment discontinuation in four (11%) patients in the every-12-weeks cohort and five (13%) patients in the every-6-weeks cohort. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Confirmed objective responses were achieved in 18 (47% [95% CI 31-64]) patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 15 (38% [95% CI 23-55]) patients in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort; median duration of response was not reached in either cohort, with median follow-up times of 12·8 months (IQR 9·3-15·5) in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 11·8 months (6·7-15·9) in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort. In patients with PD-L1 of 1% or greater, confirmed objective responses were achieved in 12 (57%) of 21 patients in the ipilimumab every-12-weeks cohort and 13 (57%) of 23 patients in the ipilimumab every-6-weeks cohort. INTERPRETATION: In NSCLC, first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab had a tolerable safety profile and showed encouraging clinical activity characterised by a high response rate and durable response. To our knowledge, the results of this study are the first suggestion of improved benefit compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy  in patients with NSCLC, supporting further assessment of this combination in a phase 3 study.

Although RT induces an abscopal effect in some patients due to enhanced immune response to the tumor, immune-escape mechanisms, including up-regulation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells, limit this benefit in other patients. Hence, many studies have promoted the synergy of RT and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) treatment for antitumor immunity. However, outcome may be improved when more therapies are combined, but risk of side effects can be increased. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein present 3 advanced cancer patients with pulmonary metastasis and who received RT. Later, they underwent anti-PD-1 treatment and unfortunately suffered from anti-PD-1-related pneumonitis over the nonirradiated  areas after 4 cycles of treatment. The upregulation of cellular PD-1 expression in these areas was considered and the immune overreaction by anti-PD-1 treatment  may cause these severe pulmonary adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Our review of 3 cases warrants careful workup to reduce the risk of side effects by combinative therapy with RT and anti-PD-1 treatment."

The molecular dissection of lung cancers led to the development of new oral targeted therapies, mainly kinase inhibitors, in 15% of non-small cell lung cancer patients of which tumors exhibit oncogenic activating mutations or gene translocations involving genes encoding for kinases. The overall survival of patients with such tumors with addictive gene alterations reaches several years with those kinase inhibitors nowadays, with new generation  drugs in second or third-line settings, extending such survival by acting on resistance mutations emerging after first-line therapy. Individual screening of lung cancer using low dose CT-scanner in smoker patients aged 55-74 years, allows the finding of small stage IA cancer nodules, with long-term survival rates exceeding 80% at 5 years. For such small tumors, patients take advantage of minimally invasive surgery, such as sub-lobar resection, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS). Such small tumors could also be cured by stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. At last,  the monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoint proteins, currently consist of the new therapeutic revolution in 20 to 30% of patients with tumors highly expressing the PD-1/PD-L1 proteins, with a plateau of long term survival, at the  cost of immune side effects which do not significantly impair quality of life in  most treated patients."

Consequently, Hodgkin lymphoma is considered an important disease  in the field of oncology. Combined modality therapy, which combines chemotherapy  and radiotherapy, has resulted in cure rates of more than 80% in patients with early stages of this disease, although long-term sequelae remain a problem. Response-adapted therapy using FDG-PET is being studied as a treatment strategy in an attempt to attenuate treatment to reduce toxicity in interim-PET negative cases and to enhance therapeutic intensity for interim-PET positive cases. In addition, brentuximab vedotin, which targets CD30 and anti-PD-1 antibodies, which represent immune checkpoint inhibitors, is effective even when treatment resistance develops after autologous transplantation. Both high cure rates and toxicity control are essential targets for treatment modalities of Hodgkin lymphoma.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) restore and augment the antitumor immune activities of cytotoxic T cells by mainly blocking immune checkpoint molecules on T cells or their ligands on antigen-presenting and tumor  cells. Based on preclinical data, many clinical trials have demonstrated the acceptable safety profiles and efficacies of mAb in various cancers. The A first-in-class approved immune checkpoint inhibitor is ipilimumab, which is a fully humanized mAb that blocks the immunosuppressive signal by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4. In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. Then, nivolumab, which is a humanized mAb that blocks programmed death-1 (PD-1), was approved for use in the treatment of advanced melanoma in 2014 and of advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in 2015 in Japan. Pembrolizumab, which is another anti-PD-1 antibody, was approved for use in the treatment of advanced melanoma and advanced NSCLC as the first-line therapy in 2016 in Japan. Thereafter, nivolumab was also approved for use in the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer in August 2016, of Hodgkin's lymphoma in December 2016, and of  head and neck cancer in March 2017 in Japan. Moreover, phase III trials of anti-PD-1 mAb and anti-PD-ligand 1 mAb for use in the treatment of cancers, such  as gastric, ovarian, bladder, and esophageal cancers, are ongoing. Several clinical trials have investigated new agents, alone and in combination, for use in the treatment of various cancers. Current advances in tumor immunology have unveiled the importance of immunosuppressive cells, such as regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and tumor-associated macrophages, especially in a tumor microenvironment (TME). Some data from basic research in mouse models and the immunomonitoring of cancer patients suggest that the inhibition of immunosuppressive cells and the cytokines related to them activate and infiltrate cytotoxic T cells and in TME, which could be one of the next combination strategies.

A phase I/Ib study to assess the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) for  the treatment of relapsed hematological malignancies after allo-HCT has shown that induction treatment with ipilimumab led to remissions in some patients, including those with myeloid malignancies, without eliciting severe graft versus  host disease (GVHD). The efficacy of treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies before or after allo-HCT has been reported in some case reports and in one retrospective study, but one case of fatal GVHD caused by anti-PD-1 antibody therapy after allo-HCT raises a concern. Considering that remission status after transplantation is a strong prognostic factor in allo-HCT, immune checkpoint inhibitors might work better during post-remission consolidation than during induction.

Therapeutics suppression of this interaction will show a promise in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer by restoring the functional anti-tumor T-cell activity. We aimed to evaluate the association between the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1, stromal CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and p53 with the clinicopathological characteristics, response to chemotherapy, progression-free-survival, and overall survival. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We examined the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1, stromal CD8+ TILs, and p53 expression in 50 patients with advanced stage (III&IV) non-small cell lung cancer. PD-L1 was expressed in 56% of the studied cases. PD-L1 expression was related to unfavorable response to the therapy without significant difference. PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with disease progression, poor progression-free-survival & overall survival. CD8+ TILs were high in 32% of the cases. Tumors with high CD8+ TILs showed a partial response to therapy and had a  better progression-free-survival and overall survival. p53 expressed in 82% of the studied cases. There was a significant negative association between PD-L1 and CD8+ TILs (p=0.009), while a non-significant association was found between p53 and PD-L1 (p=0.183). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 overexpression is an unfavorable prognostic marker, while the high CD8 + TILs is a good prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer.

Recently, it has been shown that statins have immunomodulatory properties, probably mediated by their effects on Tregs. Therefore, we evaluated the in vivo effect of atorvastatin (ATV) on Tregs and its association with the inflammatory process in a model of allergic asthma. BALB/c mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged with intranasal OVA. ATV (40 mg/kg) was delivered by daily intraperitoneal injection for 7 or 15 days before each OVA challenge. ATV treatment for 7 days increased the frequency of Tregs in mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) and the interleukin (IL)-10 in lungs. After 15 days of treatment, ATV increased the percentage of glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein (GITR+) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1+) Tregs in the lung, without enhancing their suppressive activity, but also increased the percentage of conventional T cells expressing GITR+, PD1+, and OX-40 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4). Although no significant changes were observed in the number of inflammatory cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), OVA-specific immunoglobulin E in the serum, and type 2 helper (Th2) cytokines in the lungs, there was a significant decrease of peribronchial inflammation that negatively correlated with the Tregs in MLN and the concentration of IL-10 in the lung. These results suggest that ATV has an immunomodulatory role possibly mediated by  their effects on Tregs, which could contribute to the control of inflammation during allergic asthma. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the contribution of Treg to immunomodulatory action of statins in the context of allergic asthma."

This regulation of the immune microenvironment favors immune tolerance to the neoplastic cells. In this  study, we have investigated the prognostic role of immune-checkpoint expression markers in a cohort of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. RNA was isolated from fresh-frozen lung specimens (tumor and normal lung) (n = 178). RTqPCR was performed to analyze the relative expression of 20 immune-related genes that were normalized by the use of endogenous genes selected by GeNorm algorithm. Patients with higher expression levels of IL23A and LGALS2 presented better outcomes. In the clustering expression patterns, we observed that patients with higher expression of immunoregulatory genes had better survival rates. Additionally, these data were used to develop a gene expression score. Since CTLA4 and PD1 were associated with prognosis based on Cox regression analysis (Z-score > 1.5), a multivariate model including these two genes was created. Absolute regression coefficients from this analysis were used in order to calculate the immune-checkpoint score: (PD1×0.116) + (CTLA4×0.059) for each case. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with high immune-checkpoint score have longer overall survival (OS) [NR vs. 40.4 mo, p = 0.008] and longer relapse-free survival (RFS) [82.6 vs. 23 mo, p = 0.009]. Multivariate analysis in the entire cohort indicated that the immune-checkpoint score was an independent biomarker of prognosis for OS [HR: 0.308; 95% CI, 0.156-0.609; p = 0.001] and RFS [HR: 0.527; 95% CI, 0.298-0.933; p = 0.028] in early-stage NSCLC patients. In conclusion, this score provides relevant prognostic information for a better characterization of early stage NSCLS patients with strikingly different outcomes and who may be candidates for immune-based therapies."

Areas covered: The authors discuss the recent advances in the understanding of immunology and antitumor immune responses that have led to the development of new immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint pathways, such as Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Currently, two PD-1 inhibitors are available in clinical practice for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): nivolumab  and pembrolizumab. Expert opinion: Ongoing research will dictate future strategies, including the potential incorporation of immunotherapy in stage dependent treatment settings (early stage locally advanced disease and first line therapy for metastatic disease). Immunotherapy combinations are promising avenues, and careful selection of patients, doses of each agent and information supporting strategies (i.e. concomitant or sequential) is still needed."

In patients with NSCLC harboring specific genetic alterations the anti EGFR TKIs and the ALK  TKIs have improved the response rate and the quality of life compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy. New approaches possibly applicable at the major of patients are needed. Areas covered: The discovery that the immune system plays a  fundamental role in the fight against cancer. The cancer cells use mechanisms able to avoid the immune control has led to the development of drugs able to overcome this escape route. The best known checkpoint pathways are the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1; they suppress T-cell activity in different ways: CTLA-4 regulates T-cell activity at an early stage whereas PD-1 regulates later effector T-cell activity within tissue and tumors. The best characterized checkpoint inhibitors in advanced NSCLC setting are ipilimumab and tremelimumab, (anti-CTLA-4 antibodies), nivolumab and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibodies), atezolizumab and durvalumab (anti-PD-L1 antibodies). Nivolumab and pembrolizumab have received the FDA and EMA approval for the treatment of NSCLC in second-line setting. Expert commentary: The role played by tumor microenvironment may be the next area of research to overcome the resistance at the checkpoint inhibitors as well as the identification of biomarkers to better select patients. In addition checkpoint inhibitors are investigate in combination with other agent involved in immune control with promising results in solid tumors."

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is involved in the progression and immune evasion of cancers. Therefore, we investigated the association between PD-L1 expression and EMT phenotype in pADC.  Immunohistochemistry for E-cadherin (epithelial marker), ZEB1, SNAIL, SLUG, vimentin (mesenchymal markers), PD-L1, CD8, and PD-1 was performed on 477 cases of pADC. Cases were classified into epithelial, mesenchymal, epithelial-mesenchymal, and unspecified types based on immunohistochemical results. PD-L1 expression was scored as 0 in 14.0% (n=67), 1 in 26.4% (n=126), 2  in 51.2% (n=244), and 3 in 8.4% (n=40). PD-L1 score was positively correlated with SNAIL and vimentin H scores (P<.001, both). After dichotomizing patients into PD-L1-negative and PD-L1-positive groups, PD-L1 positivity was significantly higher in patients with mesenchymal (71.2%; 84/118) and epithelial-mesenchymal (62.7%; 84/134) phenotypes compared with those with epithelial (50.6%; 44/87) and unspecified (50.0%; 35/70) phenotypes (P=.005). The significant association between PD-L1 expression and EMT phenotype was maintained in EGFR-mutated pADCs.  Moreover, cases with EMT phenotype (ie, mesenchymal and epithelial-mesenchymal) were infiltrated by higher numbers of CD8+ and PD-1+ cells than those with epithelial and unspecified phenotypes in EGFR-mutated pADCs (P=.043 for CD8+ cells and P<.001 for PD-l+ cells). Particularly, cases with EMT phenotype and PD-L1 expression showed the greatest amount of CD8+ and PD-1+ cells in EGFR-mutated cases (P=.043 for CD8+ cells and P=.005 for PD-1+ cells). This study demonstrates that EMT phenotype is related to PD-L1 overexpression in pADC cells  and patients with EMT-phenotype pADC may benefit from PD-1/PD-L1-blocking immunotherapy."

To assess the efficacy and safety of different dose schedules of pembrolizumab in the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and melanoma. Search method: MEDLINE database has been searched. Reference lists of original studies and review articles were checked for other related articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Prospective clinical trials reporting the outcomes of more than one dose schedule of pembrolizumab in the treatment of advanced NSCLC and melanoma. The review author extracted information on the outcomes of the study for this review, and presented the results. MAIN Four trials with 3425 patients were included in this systematic review. Pooled analysis for the odds ratio of objective response rate comparing 2 versus 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in advanced melanoma was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.71-1.49; p = 0.89), while for advanced NSCLC, it was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.66-1.43; p = 0.87). Moreover, odds ratio for selected side effects between the two doses was as follows: rash: 0.83 (95 CI: 0.58-1.18; p = 0.29); vitiligo: 1.27 (95% CI: 0.62-2.61; p = 0.52); diarrhea: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.63-1.42; p = 0.79); hypothyroidism: 0.97 (95% CI: 0.63-1.50; p = 0.90); hepatitis/elevated transaminases: 1.86 (95% CI: 0.91-3.79; p = 0.09); nephritis: 0.88 (95% CI: 0.32-2.44; p = 0.80); pneumonitis: 1.17 (95% CI: 0.62-2.23; p = 0.63). Given the equivalence in efficacy and safety between lower doses and higher doses of pembrolizumab, 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks seems to be an appropriate dose for routine practice in advanced pretreated NSCLC and melanoma."

The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction plays important roles in cancer immunology, and expression of PD-L1 has been discovered in NSCLC tumor cells. Since follicular helper T (Tfh) cells have characteristic high PD-1 expression, we therefore investigated the inflammatory status of Tfh in NSCLC. CD4+CXCR5+ T cell population was examined to define Tfh cells. Data showed that frequency of Tfh cells in peripheral blood was significantly lower in NSCLC patients than in healthy controls. In both primary and metastatic tumors, infiltration of Tfh cells was observed, suggesting that they participated in the  antitumor immunity of NSCLC patients. Compared to other T cell subsets, the Tfh cells from the peripheral blood and the resected tumors of NSCLC patients presented elevated apoptosis and reduced proliferation capacity. The Tfh cells from NSCLC patients were also less effective at downregulating IgD and upregulating CD27 expression in naive B cells, and induced less IgM, IgG and IgA  secretion, than those from healthy controls. We then found that the survival time from the date of surgery was positively correlated with the frequency of tumor-infiltrating Tfh cells in NSCLC subjects. Overall, the results from this study demonstrated that the Tfh cells were likely involved in the antitumor immunity and were associated with better clinical outcomes, but suffered strong immunosuppression in NSCLC. Enhancing the Tfh cell activity therefore represents  a potential therapeutic strategy in NSCLC."

However, a systemic immune reaction manifested by dose-limiting inflammation in the skin and gut has been a consistent adverse effect. To address the possibility that intra-tumoral immune changes contribute to the anti-cancer activity of EGFR inhibition, squamous cancers were produced by syngeneic orthografts of either EGFR null or wildtype mouse primary keratinocytes transduced with an oncogenic H-ras retrovirus. Flow cytometric, RNA and Bioplex immunoassay analyses of the tumor immune milieu were performed. Cancers forming from keratinocytes genetically depleted of EGFR were smaller than wildtype cancers and had fewer infiltrating FoxP3 Treg cells, lower Foxp3 RNA and a lower percentage of CD4 PD1  positive cells indicating a tumor cell autonomous regulation of its microenvironment. Hosts bearing wildtype cancers treated with gefitinib for 1 week showed a trend for smaller tumors. In this short term pharmacological model, there was also a trend to reduced FoxP3 cells and FoxP3 RNA in the tumors of treated mice as well as a substantial increase in the ratio of IL-1A/IL-1RA transcripts. These results suggest that relatively brief systemic inhibition of EGFR signaling alters the immune environment of the targeted cancer. Together these data imply that an EGFR dependent Treg function supports the growth of squamous cancers and is a target for the therapeutic activity of EGFR inhibition."

Little is known about its incidence across different tumor types and treatment regimens. Objective: To compare the incidence of PD-1 inhibitor-related pneumonitis among different tumor types and therapeutic regimens. Data Sources: A PubMed search through November 10, 2015, and a review of references from relevant articles. For the PubMed search, the following keywords  or corresponding Medical Subject Heading terms were used: nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and PD-1 inhibitor. Study Selection: Twenty-six original articles of PD-1 inhibitor trial results were identified. Among them, 20 studies of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were eligible for a meta-analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The data were extracted by 1 primary reviewer and  then independently reviewed by 2 secondary reviewers following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Comparisons  of the incidence were based on marginal, exact generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations. Incidence of all-grade and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis and pneumonitis-related deaths. Results: Twenty studies of single-tumor-type trials of PD-1 inhibitor (12 melanoma studies, 5 NSCLC studies, and 3 RCC studies) (a total of 4496 unique patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The overall incidence of pneumonitis during PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy was 2.7% (95% CI, 1.9%-3.6%) for all-grade and 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.2%) for grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. The incidence was higher in NSCLC for all-grade (4.1% vs 1.6%; P = .002) and grade 3  or higher pneumonitis (1.8% vs 0.2%; P < .001) compared with melanoma. The incidence in RCC was higher than in melanoma for all-grade pneumonitis (4.1% vs 1.6%; P < .001) but not for grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Four pneumonitis-related deaths were observed in patients with NSCLC in the monotherapy group. Pneumonitis was more frequent during combination therapy than  monotherapy for all-grade (6.6% vs 1.6%; P < .001) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (1.5% vs 0.2%; P = .001) in melanoma, with 1 pneumonitis-related death during combination therapy. Multivariable analyses demonstrated higher odds of pneumonitis in NSCLC for all-grade (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08-1.89;  P = .005) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.60-5.08; P < .001) and in RCC for all-grade pneumonitis (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.32-1.92; P < .001) compared with melanoma. The combination therapy had significantly higher odds than monotherapy for all-grade (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.69-2.50; P < .001) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.79- 4.35; P < .001). The incidence of PD-1 inhibitor-related pneumonitis was higher in NSCLC and RCC and during combination therapy. These findings contribute to enhance awareness among clinicians and support further investigations to meet the clinical needs."

A novel therapy based on programed  death 1 (PD-1)/programed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors showed an increasing potential in several malignancies including advanced NSCLC. This article is a meta-analysis aiming to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of PD-1/PD-L1 agents in patients with NSCLC. Data were collected from eligible studies searched from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. SYNTHESIS Pooled hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated to assess the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors versus docetaxel, pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated for objective response rate (ORR). The overall frequency was estimated for 1-year OS, 1-year progression-free survival, and ORR. A subgroup analysis among NSCLC patients tested with different epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status was also performed to figure out the relationship between EGFR status and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. OR for occurrence of any grade and grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse effect was calculated for evaluating the safety of PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. Nine studies were included in this analysis. The pooled HRs for OS and PFS were 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.75) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.91), respectively, the pooled OR for ORR was 1.83 (95% CI 1.41-2.36), indicating a significant improvement in OS, PFS, and ORR. In the results of subgroup analysis, the HR for OS in NSCLC patients was 1.05 (95% CI 0.69-1.59) in patients with mutant EGFR and 0.66 (95% CI 0.57-0.77) in patients with wild-type  EGFR status. OR for occurrence was 0.36 (95% CI 0.28-0.46) in any grade treatment-related adverse effect and 0.18 (95% CI 0.14-0.22) in grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse effect, suggesting a superior safety profile of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: The PD-1/PD-L1 therapy significantly prolonged the OS and improved the ORR, simultaneously lowering the treatment-related adverse effect events versus docetaxel."

However, the expression pattern of PD-L1 and the presence of CD8+ and PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating T cells in the basaloid variant of  squamous cell carcinoma remain unknown. immunohistochemistry analysis of PD-L1 expression, with three recently validated monoclonal antibodies used in clinical  trials (clones SP142, SP263, and 28-8), and detection of CD8+ and PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating T cells was performed on whole-tissue sections from 56 patients following surgery for basaloid squamous cell carcinoma. Data were correlated to clinicopathological parameters and outcome. Fair to poor concordance was observed between the SP142 vs SP263 clones, and SP142 vs 28-8 (κ  range, 0.018-0.412), while the 28-8 and SP263 demonstrated a strong correlation in both the tumor cell and immune cell compartments (κ=0.883, and κ=0.721). Expression of PD-L1 correlated with a high content of CD8+ and PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating T cells when using SP142 (P=0.012; P=0.022), but not with SP263 or 28-8 (P=0.314; P=0.611). In the multivariate analysis, we found significantly better disease-free and overall survival rates for high PD-L1 expression with SP142, CD8+ and PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating T cells (P=0.003; P=0.007). No significant prognosis value was observed for SP263 and 28-8 clones,  except a correlation between improved overall survival and SP263 in the univariate analysis (P=0.039), not confirmed in the multivariate model. In conclusion, we report that the expression of PD-L1 and the content of CD8+ and PD-1+ tumor-infiltrating T cells is an independent indicator of better outcome in basaloid squamous cell carcinoma patients, although the observed effect is dependent on the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay."

This suboptimal outcome is probably due in part to the complex network of immunosuppressive pathways present in advanced tumors, which are unlikely to be overcome by intervention at a single signaling checkpoint. Here we describe a combination immunotherapy that recruits a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells to eliminate large tumor burdens in syngeneic tumor models and a genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma; to our knowledge tumors of this size have not previously been curable by treatments relying on endogenous immunity. Maximal antitumor efficacy required four components: a tumor-antigen-targeting antibody,  a recombinant interleukin-2 with an extended half-life, anti-PD-1 and a powerful  T cell vaccine. Depletion experiments revealed that CD8+ T cells, cross-presenting dendritic cells and several other innate immune cell subsets were required for tumor regression. Effective treatment induced infiltration of immune cells and production of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor, enhanced antibody-mediated tumor antigen uptake and promoted antigen spreading. These results demonstrate the capacity of an elicited endogenous immune response to destroy large, established tumors and elucidate essential characteristics of combination immunotherapies that are capable of curing a majority of tumors in experimental settings typically viewed as intractable."

In the clinical trials of nivolumab, its adverse effects were reported to be less likely than those of conventional anti-cancer agents; however, after practical clinical distribution, it has come to be known that nivolumab induces various immune-related adverse events. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old male with a recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma was treated with nivolumab. Only four days after the initial administration of nivolumab, the patient presented with unbearable restlessness and distress that was resistant to all therapeutic agents used, and it gradually became worse. He finally came to need deep sedation despite his cancer status being stable during the course. Clinical tests including magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid cytology, and antibodies of paraneoplastic syndrome exhibited no signs of encephalitis or another possible cause of the neuropathy. The diagnosis of akathisia could be made only by his somatoform presentation. It was uncertain whether or not this complication was correlated with the activation of his immune system. CONCLUSIONS Anti-immune check point inhibitors may induce many unknown adverse events. Severe akathisia induced by nivolumab, as in our case, has not been reported yet.

We found that expression levels of Tim-3, PD-1 and CTLA-4 in T cells from MPE were upregulated compared with those from PB, but levels of IFN-γ and Granzyme B were  downregulated (p < 0.05). The amount of TGF-β was significantly higher in MPE than in PB (p < 0.05). TGF-β was mainly produced by TAMs in MPE. When T cells were co-cultured with TAMs, expression levels of Tim-3, PD-1 and CTLA-4 were significantly higher than controls, whereas levels of IFN-γ and Granzyme B were significantly decreased, in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). In vitro treatment with anti-TGF-β antibody restored the impaired T cell cytotoxic activity in MPE. Our results indicate that macrophage-derived TGF-β plays an important role in impaired T cell cytotoxicity. It will therefore be valuable to  develop therapeutic strategies against TGF-β pathway for MPE therapy of lung cancer."

Napoli, December 1st-4th 2015.","The sixth Melanoma Bridge Meeting took place in Naples, Italy, December 1st-4th, 2015. The four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and 4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. Recent advances in tumor biology and immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of  cancer patients. Immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful  approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung  cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin's disease. Specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Despite demonstrated successes, responses to immunotherapy  interventions occur only in a minority of patients. Attempts are being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers. Optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (IO) field. Importantly, biomarkers could help to design rational combination therapies. In addition, biomarkers may help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g., CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR)  modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and immunosuppressive cytokines. In addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers development and their validation for clinical use. Recent clinical trial results  have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137) receptors on  T cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. These agents are also being tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. Various locoregional interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients' population. This meeting's specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and combination therapy for melanoma. The importance of understanding of melanoma genomic background for  development of novel therapies and biomarkers for clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. The overall emphasis  on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to  impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma. We also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy. The concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and clinical validation design for specific assays."

Upregulation of this tryptophan (Trp)-catabolizing enzyme, in tumor cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME), leads to Trp depletion that impairs cytotoxic T cell responses and survival; however, exact mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We previously reported that a combination therapy of gemcitabine and a superoxide dismutase mimetic promotes anti-tumor immunity in a mouse model of lung cancer by inhibiting MDSCs, enhancing polyfunctional response of CD8+ memory T cells, and extending survival. Here, we show that combination therapy targets IDO signaling, specifically in MDSCs, tumor cells, and CD8+ T cells infiltrating the TME. Deficiency of IDO caused significant reduction in tumor burden, tumor-infiltrating MDSCs, GM-CSF, MDSC survival and infiltration of programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-expressing CD8+ T cells compared to controls. IDO-/- MDSCs downregulated nutrient-sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, but IDO-/- CD8+ T cells showed AMPK activation associated with enhanced effector function. Our studies provide proof-of-concept for the efficacy of this  combination therapy in inhibiting IDO and T cell exhaustion in a syngeneic model  of lung cancer and provide mechanistic insights for IDO-dependent metabolic reprogramming of MDSCs that reduces T cell exhaustion and regulates anti-tumor immunity."

Since alterations in DNA repair genes have been connected to the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors, we investigated associations between methylation of DNA repair genes and CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) expression.A list of DNA repair genes (179 genes) was selected from the literature, methylation status and expression of inflammation-associated genes (The Cancer Genome Atlas data) was correlated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cervical and lung squamous cell carcinoma.A significant positive correlation of the methylation status of 15, 3 and 2 genes with checkpoint expression was identified, respectively. RAD51B methylation was identified in all cancer subtypes. In HNSCC and cervical cancer, there was significant enrichment for homologous recombination genes. Methylation of the candidate genes was also associated with expression of other checkpoints, ligands, MHC- and T-cell associated genes as well as an interferon-inflammatory immune gene signature, predictive for the efficacy of PD-1 inhibition in HNSCC.Homologous recombination deficiency might therefore be mediated by DNA repair gene hypermethylation and linked to an immune-evasive phenotype in SCC. The methylation status of these genes could represent a new predictive biomarker  for immune checkpoint inhibition."

We evaluated individual lesion and inter-patient response by response  evaluation (RECIST) 1.1, immune-related response criteria (irRC), CHOI and modified CHOI (mCHOI) and correlated response with overall survival (OS). Thirty-seven patients with 567 measurable lesions treated with pembrolizumab in the Keynote 001 trial were studied. Association of response with OS was determined. Response varied according to site; lung lesions had the highest rate of  complete response (69 out of 163 (42%) vs other sites 71 out of 404 (18%), P<0.0001). Delayed response post first scan was seen in 2 out of 37 (5%) deemed progressive (PD) by RECIST and 2 out of 14 (14%) deemed PD by irRC. Modified CHOI criteria showed response of 38% (14 out of 37). Change in tumour size and density on first follow-up assessment was associated with OS with each 1000 mm2 increase  in tumour size from baseline increasing the hazard of dying by 25.9% (HR=1.259, (95% CI=1.116-1.420), P=0.0002). Similarly, each 20HU increase in density increased the HR by 15% (HR=1.15, (95% CI 1.045-1.260), P=0.004). Response defined by any criteria had superior OS (CHOI P=0.0084; mCHOI P=0.0183; irRC P<0.0001 and RECIST P=0.0003). Response by any criterion was prognostic. Novel patterns of response and changes on treatment in tumour density suggest complex anti-tumour responses  to immunotherapy."

Fifty-one trials including 6,800 patients were included. The overall response rates for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were 29% (95% CI: 1.53-2.41), 21% (95% CI: 17%-25%) and 21% (95%  CI: 16%-27%) respectively. While the overall adverse effects rate for melanoma, NSCLC, RCC were 16% (95% CI: 6%-28%), 11% (95% CI: 8%-14%) and 20% (95% CI: 11%-32%) respectively. Tumor PD-L1 expression and patient smoking status might serve as biomarkers to predict response of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treatment. Compared to tumors with negative PD-L1 expression, tumors with positive PD-L1 expression had a significantly higher clinical response rate (41.4% versus 26.5%) with RR = 1.92 (95% CI: 1.53-2.41, P < 0.001). Smoker patients also showed a significantly higher response rate (33.7%) than patients who never smoked (4.2%)  with RR = 6.02 (95% CI: 1.22-29.75, P = 0.028). Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab were  associated with significantly increased response rate (RR = 2.89, 95% CI: 2.46-3.40, P < 0.001), reduced death risk (HR= 0.53; 95% CI: 0.48-0.57; P < 0.001), and decreased adverse effect rate (RR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.30-0.80, P = 0.004) compared with other therapies. Clinical trials reporting response or safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for advanced or refractory cancer patients published before January 31th 2016 were searched in PubMed and EMBASE database. Meta-analyses using random effects models were used to calculate the overall estimate. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have high response rates and low adverse  effect rates for advanced or refractory cancers."

Indeed, an objective clinical response was observed after treatment by anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 in many indications but the treatment still failed in 70 to 80 % of cases treated. Given the adverse effects  and the high cost of these therapies, there is a need for the development of biomarkers. This review focus on potential predictive biomarkers. In peripheral blood, high level of Il-2 soluble receptor at baseline and absence of ICOS+ CD4-T lymphocytes induction may be associated with the absence of clinical response for melanoma patients treated by ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). PD-L1 - PD-1 ligand- expression on cancer lung adenocarcinoma and melanoma is associated with an improved clinical response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1. Nevertheless, a standardization of the biological assays is needed before a clinical translation. CD8-T cell tumor infiltration seems to be a prerequisite to an optimal clinical response after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 administration. In situ high mutational load is associated with a CD8-T cell infiltration and a higher rate of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 response.  If we consider a more holistic approach, the role of the gut microbiota in the response to these treatments is now well established in pre-clinical experiments. The universal marker is not identified so far, but the reliable marker should be  in the tumor compartment and combining multiples markers could be suitable to predict response in different contexts."

Ten of 12 lung tumor samples were concordant while 2 were discordant. PD-L1 expression by flow cytometry varied widely (1.2-89.4 %) even in the positive concordant cases. In addition, PD-L1 expression in the aneuploid tumor population did not necessarily agree with the expression in the diploid tumor population. Fine, unequivocal quantification of PD-L1 on tumor and  immune cells in NSCLC may allow for better prediction of response to therapies.

Ligation of PD1 with its ligands PDL1 and PDL2 results in transduction of negative signals to T-cells. PD1 expression is an important mechanism contributing to the exhausted effector T-cell phenotype. The  expression of PD1 on effector T-cells and PDL1 on neoplastic cells enables tumor  cells to evade anti-tumor immunity. Blockade of PD1 is an important immunotherapeutic strategy for cancers. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is a humanized monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody that has been extensively investigated in numerous malignancies. In melanoma refractory to targeted therapy, pembrolizumab induced overall response rates (ORRs) of 21-34%. It was superior to another immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab (Yervoy) in stage III/IV unresectable melanoma. In refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pembrolizumab induced ORRs of 19-25%. Based on these results, pembrolizumab was approved by the USA FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma and NSCLC. Tumor cell PDL1 expression may be a valid response predictor. Molecular analysis also showed that tumors with high gene mutation burdens, which might result in the formation of more tumor-related  neo-antigens, had better responses to pembrolizumab. In malignancies including lymphomas and other solid tumors, preliminary data showed that ORRs of around 20-50 % could be achieved. Adverse events occurred in up to 60% of patients, but  grade 3/4 toxicities were observed in <10% of cases. Immune-related adverse events including thyroid dysfunction, hepatitis and pneumonitis are more serious  and may lead to cessation of treatment."

This study is a retrospective analysis of patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cancer at Antônio Ermírio de Moraes Oncology Center, Brazil. To be eligible for this analysis, patients must have had unequivocal evidence of disease progression on anti-PD1 therapy and subsequent radiotherapy for any tumor site while still receiving anti-PD1. The abscopal effect was characterized as a response outside the irradiated field after radiotherapy plus anti-PD1. Sixteen patients were evaluated, including 12 metastatic melanoma, 2 metastatic NSCLC, and 2 metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The median time to disease progression on anti-PD1 was 3 months. The radiotherapy field included lung, lymph nodes, and bones, with a median total dose of 24 Gy (1-40 Gy), usually in 3 fractions (1-10 fractions). Three patients with melanoma developed an abscopal effect at a rate of 18.7% (25% among melanoma patients). Of note, one of them achieved a remarkable complete response lasting >6 months. Three patients with melanoma obtained a significant local response after radiotherapy, despite no response in distant metastases. Eleven patients presented disease progression after radiotherapy. No increased toxicity was observed. In conclusion, no patients with NSCLC or renal cancer showed abscopal effect, but 25% of patients with melanoma showed regression of nonirradiated lesions when anti-PD1 was continued after radiation to a tumor site that had progressed on anti-PD1 monotherapy."

However, PD-L1 expression in association with subtypes of tumor-associated lymphocytes and molecular alterations has not been well characterized in lung adenocarcinomas. PD-L1 expression was evaluated in 261 resected lung adenocarcinomas using tissue microarrays and various scoring systems, and was correlated with clinicopathologic/molecular features, including the extent/subtype of tumor-associated lymphocytes (i.e., CD8, T-bet [Th1 transcription factor], and GATA3 [Th2 transcription factor]), and patient outcomes. PD-L1 expression was present in 129 (49%), 95 (36.5%), and 62 (24%) cases using cutoffs of ≥1%, ≥5%, and ≥50%, respectively, 98 (38%) by H score and  72 (28%) by immune score. PD-L1 expression was associated with abundant CD8+ and/or T-bet+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and EGFR wild-type, significant smoking history, and aggressive pathologic features. In addition, concurrent PD-L1 expression and abundant CD8+ tumor-associated lymphocytes were seen in 25%  of KRAS mutants or cases with no alterations by clinical molecular testing as opposed to only 7.4% of EGFR mutants. PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with decreased progression-free and overall survival rates by univariate analysis, but not by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression in resected lung adenocarcinomas is frequently observed in the presence of CTL/Th1 microenvironment, in particular in those with KRAS mutations or no common molecular alterations, suggesting that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis may be a promising treatment strategy to reinstitute active immune response for at least a subset of such patient populations."

Tumor samples from 65 patients with mesothelioma were evaluated for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and its prognostic significance was examined. Malignant effusions from patients with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma were evaluated for PD-1-positive and PD-L1-positive infiltrating lymphocytes and their role in inducing PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of avelumab, a fully humanized immunoglobulin G1 anti PD-L1 antibody against primary mesothelioma cell lines, was evaluated in presence of autologous and allogeneic natural killer cells. Of 65 pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma tumors examined, 41 (63%) were PD-L1-positive, which was associated with slightly inferior overall survival compared to patients with PD-L1-negative tumors (median 23.0 versus 33.3 months,  p = 0.35). The frequency of PD-L1 expression was similar in patients with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, with 62% and 64% of samples testing positive, respectively. In nine mesothelioma effusion samples evaluated, the fraction of cells expressing PD-L1 ranged from 12% to 83%. In seven patients with paired malignant effusion and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples, PD-L1 expression was significantly higher on CD3-positive T cells present in malignant  effusions as compared with PBMCs (p = 0.016). In addition, the numbers of CD14-positive PD-1-positive cells were increased in malignant effusions compared  with PBMCs (p = 0.031). The lymphocytes present in malignant effusions recognized autologous tumor cells and induced interferon-γ-mediated PD-L1 expression on the  tumor cell surface. Of the three primary mesothelioma cell lines tested, two were susceptible to avelumab-mediated ADCC in the presence of autologous natural killer cells. Most pleural as well as peritoneal mesotheliomas express PD-L1. Malignant effusions in this disease are characterized by the presence of tumor cells and CD3-positive T cells that highly express PD-L1. In addition, mesothelioma tumor cells are susceptible to ADCC by the anti-PD-L1 antibody avelumab."

In a systematic review of the reported prospective clinical trials, data for response rate, median PFS, and median OS were extracted from 12 arms in 10 reported clinical trials using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody, and their correlation was investigated. In a retrospective analysis at our institution, OS was compared according to tumor response on 5- to 9-week computed tomography scans and status  of being progression-free at 8, 16, and 24 weeks by landmark analysis in 71 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies between 2013 and 2015.

The anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab  has shown efficacy as monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and has a non-overlapping toxicity profile with chemotherapy. We assessed whether the addition of pembrolizumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy improves efficacy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. In this randomised, open-label, phase 2 cohort of a multicohort study (KEYNOTE-021), patients were enrolled at 26 medical centres in the USA and Taiwan. Patients with chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIB or IV, non-squamous NSCLC without targetable EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four stratified by PD-L1 tumour proportion score (<1% vs ≥1%) using  an interactive voice-response system to 4 cycles of pembrolizumab 200 mg plus carboplatin area under curve 5 mg/mL per min and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks followed by pembrolizumab for 24 months and indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy or to 4 cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed alone followed by indefinite pemetrexed maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response, defined as the percentage of patients with radiologically confirmed complete or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 assessed by masked, independent central review, in the intention-to-treat population, defined as all patients who were allocated to study treatment. Significance threshold was p<0·025 (one sided). Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, defined as all patients who received at least one dose of the assigned study treatment. This trial, which is closed for enrolment but continuing for follow-up, is registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02039674. FINDINGS: Between Nov 25, 2014, and Jan 25, 2016, 123 patients were enrolled; 60  were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 63 to the chemotherapy alone group. 33 (55%; 95% CI 42-68) of 60 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group achieved an objective response compared with 18 (29%; 18-41) of 63 patients in the chemotherapy alone group (estimated treatment difference 26% [95% CI 9-42%]; p=0·0016). The incidence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events was similar between groups (23 [39%] of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 16 [26%] of 62 in the chemotherapy alone group). The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were anaemia (seven [12%] of 59) and decreased neutrophil count (three [5%]); an additional six events each occurred in two (3%) for acute kidney injury, decreased lymphocyte count, fatigue, neutropenia, and sepsis, and thrombocytopenia. In the chemotherapy alone group, the most common grade 3 or worse events were anaemia (nine [15%] of 62) and decreased neutrophil count, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia (two [3%] each). One (2%) of 59 patients in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group experienced treatment-related death because of sepsis compared with two (3%) of 62 patients in the chemotherapy group: one because of sepsis and one because of pancytopenia. INTERPRETATION: Combination of pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed could be an effective and tolerable first-line treatment option for patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 (PD-L1 IHC) was tested as a predictive biomarker.  Several IHC assays and interpretation criteria were developed in parallel. AIM: The clinical significance of PD-L1 IHC in NSCLC and the optimum method for staining and interpretation of the results are the subject of ongoing studies. The diagnostic application of immunotherapy in NSCLC necessitates harmonization of PD-L1 IHC to obtain evidence for guidelines; therefore, a consensus opinion on a well-founded diagnostic mode of testing should be defined based on published studies and the results of the first German PD-L1 IHC harmonization study. 1. Summary of the current data situation. 2. Evaluation of the first German PD-L1 IHC harmonization study (centralized, staining with PD-L1 IHC analogous to studies, 15 cases of NSCLC, 4 IHC study assays [28‑8, 22C3, SP142 and SP263] and scoring by 9 pathologists). The use of PD-L1 IHC in NSCLC is suitable for identification of patients with an increased probability of a clinical benefit from immunotherapy. The various proportional cut-offs used to interpret the staining results can be summarized in a total score, which can be reproducibly assessed. The staining patterns of the four assays investigated were, however, not congruent in all situations. DISCUSSION: In principle, the use of PD-L1 IHC for assessment of the expression in tumor cells is a reliably determinable biomarker. Evaluation algorithms should be based on published clinical trials. For NSCLC approvals with obligatory PD-L1  IHC are to be expected but it remains to be seen to what extent PD-L1 IHC will be implemented in the clinical routine."

Ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic  T lymphocyte antigen-4 mab for malignant melanoma that was approved earlier than  nivolumab in Western countries, is known to frequently cause endocrine immune-related adverse events such as hypophysitis and thyroid dysfunction. We herein report a patient with advanced melanoma who appeared to develop hypophysitis as a consequence of the inhibition of PD-1 by nivolumab. One week after the 6th administration of nivolumab, the patient developed progressive fatigue and appetite loss. Laboratory data on admission for the 7th administration of nivolumab showed eosinophilia and hyponatremia. Since ACTH and  cortisol levels were low, nivolumab was discontinued and a large dose of hydrocortisone (100 mg/d) was promptly administered intravenously. A magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed the mild enlargement of the anterior pituitary gland and thickening of the stalk with homogenous contrast. A detailed assessment of anterior pituitary functions with hypothalamic hormone challenges showed that  hormonal secretions other than ACTH and TSH were normal. With a replacement dose  of hydrocortisone (20 mg/d), the 7th administration of nivolumab was completed without exacerbating the patient's general condition.

PTML was derived from the actual total mutation load (ATML) of 575 distinct melanoma and lung cancer samples and validated using independent melanoma (n = 312) and lung cancer (n = 217) cohorts. The correlation of PTML status with clinical outcome, following distinct immunotherapies, was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. PTML (derived from 170 genes) was highly correlated with ATML in cutaneous melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma validation cohorts (R2 = 0.73 and R2 = 0.82, respectively). PTML was strongly associated with clinical outcome to ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4, three cohorts) and adoptive T-cell therapy (1 cohort) clinical outcome in melanoma. Clinical benefit from pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in  lung cancer was also shown to significantly correlate with PTML status (log rank  P value < 0.05 in all cohorts). The approach of using small NGS gene panels, already applied to guide employment of targeted therapies, may have utility in the personalized use  of immunotherapy in cancer."

Patients with baseline organ dysfunction are largely excluded from  clinical trials. Therefore it is unclear whether anti-PD-1 therapy is safe or effective in this setting. Further, these patients are often not candidates for other anti-cancer therapies, highlighting their need for active treatment options. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients from multiple centers  with advanced solid tumors and baseline organ dysfunction who received anti-PD-1  therapy. Organ dysfunction was defined as cardiac (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤45 %), renal (creatinine ≥2 mg/dL or GFR ≤30 ml/min) or hepatic dysfunction (evidence of cirrhosis on imaging or AST, ALT or bilirubin ≥3x ULN).  We assessed change in organ dysfunction, immune related adverse events (irAEs), response rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We identified 27 patients eligible for inclusion with the following diseases: renal cell carcinoma (n = 8), melanoma (10), non-small cell lung cancer (3), small cell lung cancer (2) and urothelial bladder cancer (4). Baseline organ dysfunction included renal dysfunction (n = 17), hepatic dysfunction (7), cardiac dysfunction (11), including >1 organ dysfunction (8). Worsening organ dysfunction requiring hospitalization or dose delays occurred in 8 patients (30 %) although in most cases this was thought not-drug related and resolved with supportive care. Grade 3 irAEs occurred in 2 pts (7 %; hepatitis and colitis). Thirteen of 27 patients had ongoing treatment benefit (objective response or stable disease)  at data collection (48 %). Eleven patients had primary progressive disease (41 %), 11 had stable disease (41 %), 4 had partial responses (15 %), and one had a complete response (4 %). Overall, median PFS was 168 days. Median OS was not reached. In our experience, anti-PD-1 agents in this group of patients with cardiac, hepatic or renal dysfunction were associated with tolerable irAEs and infrequent manageable worsening of organ dysfunction. Further, objective responses and prolonged PFS were observed in a number of patients.

An anti-human PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody (SP263) was optimized for use with the VENTANA OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit on the automated VENTANA BenchMark ULTRA platform. The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay was validated for use with FFPE NSCLC and HNSCC tissue samples in a series of studies addressing sensitivity, specificity, robustness, and precision. Samples from a subset of 181 patients from a Phase 1/2 study of durvalumab (NCT01693562) were analyzed to determine the optimal PD-L1 staining cut-off for enriching the probability of responses to treatment. The scoring algorithm was defined using statistical analysis of clinical response data from this clinical trial and PD-L1 staining parameters in HNSCC and NSCLC tissue. Inter-reader agreement was established by three pathologists who evaluated 81 NSCLC and 100 HNSCC samples across the range  of PD-L1 expression levels. The VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay met all pre-defined acceptance criteria. For both cancer types, a cut-off of 25 % of tumor cells with PD-L1 membrane staining of any intensity best discriminated responders from nonresponders. Samples with staining above this value were deemed to have high PD-L1 expression, and those with staining below it were deemed to have low or no PD-L1 expression.  Inter-reader agreement on PD-L1 status was 97 and 92 % for NSCLC and HNSCC, respectively. These results highlight the robustness and reproducibility of the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) Assay and support its suitability for use in the evaluation of NSCLC and HNSCC FFPE tumor samples using the devised ≥25 % tumor cell staining cut-off in a clinical setting.

Lesions with 5% or greater PD-L1 expression were considered positive. Agreement statistics and the χ(2) or Fisher's exact test were used for analysis. We analyzed 146 paired lesions from 73 cases. There was disagreement of  tumor cell PD-L1 expression in 10 cases (14%, κ = 0.71), and disagreement of TIL  PD-L1 expression in 19 cases (26%, κ = 0.38). Most paired lesions with discordant tumor cell expression of PD-L1 were obtained 6 or more months apart. When specimens were categorized using a proposed tumor microenvironment categorization scheme based on PD-L1 expression and TILs, there were significant changes in the  classifications because many of the brain metastases lacked either PD-L1 expression, tumor lymphocyte infiltration or both even when they were present in  the primary lung cancer specimens (P = 0.009). We identified that there are significant differences between the tumor microenvironment of paired primary lung cancers and brain metastases.

The role  of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker is still unclear, partially because of the nuances of PD-L1 testing. These novel therapies also challenge our existing methodologies of radiologic assessment and efficacy analysis. This new era of immunotherapy has ushered in as much hope for patients as questions from physicians that need to be answered to clarify the optimal use of these agents."

Intracavitary  immunotherapy with interleukin (IL)-2 has been proven effective in controlling MPE. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, 35 lung cancer (LC) patients with MPE and 12 healthy donors were included in this study. For the IL-2 therapy experiments, after draining partial MPE, we treated 14 patients by administrating IL-2 (3 or 5 × 10(6) U in 50 ml saline) into the thoracic cavity. Before and after IL-2 treatment (40-48 h), the MPE and peripheral blood (PB) were obtained from the subjects. PB from healthy volunteers was collected as control. The expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), granzyme B (GzmB), interferon (IFN)-γ and the proliferation were analysed in CD8(+) T cells from MPE and PB. The CD8(+) T cells in the MPE of LC patients showed lowest GzmB, IFN-γ and proliferation but highest PD-1 expression, compared with that in PB of LC patients and healthy donors. IL-2 treatment reduced the expression of PD-1, increased the expression of GzmB and IFN-γ and enhanced the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells in MPE. In addition, IL-2 treatment reduced carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) level in MPE. These results indicate that MPE CD8(+) T cells exhibit exhaustion phenotype which can be reversed by IL-2 therapy."

The identification of predictors for sensitivity or resistance to these agents is, therefore, needed. Herein, we investigate the correlation of metabolic information on FDG-PET with tissue expression of immune-checkpoints and other markers of tumor-related immunity in resected NSCLC patients. All patients referred to our institution for upfront surgical resection of NSCLC, who were investigated with FDG-PET prior to surgery, were consecutively included in the study. From January 2010 to May 2014, 55 patients (stage IA-IIIB; M:F = 42:13; mean age 68.9 years) were investigated. Sampled surgical tumor specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for  CD68-TAMs (tumor-associated macrophages), CD8-TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes), PD-1-TILs, and PD-L1 tumor expression. Immunoreactivity was evaluated, and scores were compared with imaging findings. FDG-PET images were analyzed to define semi-quantitative parameters: SUVmax and SUVmean. Metabolic information on FDG-PET was correlated with tissue markers expression and disease-free survival (DFS) considering a median follow-up of 16.2 months. Thirty-six adenocarcinomas (ADC), 18 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and one sarcomatoid carcinoma were analyzed. All tumors resulted positive at FDG-PET: median SUVmax 11.3 (range: 2.3-32.5) and SUVmean 6.4 (range: 1.5-13) both resulted significantly higher in SCC compared to other NSCLC histotypes (p = 0.007 and 0.048, respectively). IHC demonstrated a median immunoreactive surface covered by CD68-TAMs of 5.41 % (range: 0.84-14.01 %), CD8-TILs of 2.9 % (range: 0.11-11.92 %), PD-1 of 0.65 % (range: 0.02-5.87 %), and PD-L1 of 0.7 % (range: 0.03-10.29 %). We found a statistically significant correlation between SUVmax and SUVmean with the expression of CD8 TILs (rho = 0.31; p = 0.027) and PD-1 (rho = 0.33; p = 0.017 and rho = 0.36; p = 0.009, respectively). The other tissue markers correlated as follows: CD8 TILs and PD-1 (rho = 0.45; p = 0.001),  CD8 TILs and PD-L1 (rho = 0.41; p = 0.003), CD68-TAMs and PD-L1 (rho = 0.30; p = 0.027), PD-1 and PD-L1 (rho = 0.26; p = 0.059). With respect to patients' outcome, SUVmax, SUVmean, and disease stage showed a statistically significant correlation with DFS (p = 0.002, 0.004, and <0.001, respectively). The present study shows a direct association between metabolic parameters on FDG-PET and the expression of tumor-related immunity markers, suggesting a potential role for FDG-PET to characterize the tumor microenvironment and select NSCLC patients candidate to checkpoint inhibitors."

However, the contribution of sPD-L1 and mPD-L1 to immune regulation and disease progression in patients with pleural effusions remains unknown. The present study evaluated the levels of sPD-L1 and membrane-bound PD-1/PD-L1 in the peripheral blood and pleural effusions of patients with tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE), malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and non-tuberculous non-malignant pleural effusion (n-TB n-M). Furthermore, selected T lymphocytes and cluster of differentiation (CD)14+ monocytes were co-cultured to investigate the potential effect of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in TPE. Levels of sPD-L1 and PD-L1 on CD14+ monocytes were increased in the TPE group, as compared with the MPE and n-TB n-M groups. Furthermore, sPD-L1 levels and the expression levels of PD-L1 on CD14+ monocytes were demonstrated to be positively  correlated with interferon (IFN)-γ concentration in pleural effusions. Therefore, IFN-γ may increase the expression of PD-L1 on CD14+ monocytes in vitro. Cell counting kit-8 analysis demonstrated that anti-PD-L1 antibody was able to partially reverse the proliferation of T lymphocytes in the co-culture system. The results of the present study indicated that sPD-L1 or mPD-L1 are associated with the immune regulation and disease progression of TPE, and may serve as possible biomarkers of TPE. Furthermore, sPD-L1 and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway of TPE may be associated with the Th1 immune response; therefore, an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 pathway suggests a potential immune therapy strategy for the treatment of TPE."

Recently, emerging evidence has suggested that the expression of PD-L1  is related to the mutation status of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Moreover, the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway can induce expression of PD-L1. In the present study, we demonstrated that activated EGFR can upregulate the expression of PD-L1 through the interleukin 6/Janus kinase/signal transducer  and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/JAK/STAT3) signaling pathway in non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Cells treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) can downregulate the activation of the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway, which subsequently reduces the expression of PD-L1. Furthermore, silencing of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells correlated with  inhibition of cell proliferation and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. In summary, our research indicates that EGFR is involved in the regulation of PD-L1 expression and cell proliferation via the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in NSCLC. The present study suggests the potential of combined targeted therapy with immunotherapy in the treatment of NSCLC."

Tissue microarrays of matched primary and metastatic NSCLCs were used to compare four different PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) IHC techniques, as well as RNA ISH. Additional cases with whole genome and transcriptome data were assessed for molecular correlates of PD-L1 overexpression. Eighty cases were included in the IHC study. Multiple IHC methodologies showed a high rate of agreement (Kappa = 0.67). When calibrated to  RNA expression, agreement improved significantly (Kappa = 0.90, p=0.0049). PD-L1  status of primary and metastatic tumors was discordant in 17 (22%) cases. This study suggests that different IHC methodologies for PD-L1 assessment provide slightly different results. There is significant discordance between the PD-L1 status of primary tumors and lymph node metastases. RNA ISH may be a useful adjunct to complement PD-L1 IHC testing."

Toward this goal, we investigated the ability of various mAb combinations to generate a tumor-destructive immune response in vitro in the presence of lymphoid cells from mice with established TC1 lung carcinoma, B16 melanoma, or SW1 melanoma. The data strongly correlate (r=0.9, 0.89, and 0.91, respectively) with the therapeutic efficacy of the respective mAb combinations. Both in vivo and in vitro, tumor destruction was associated with a shift from a Th2 to a Th1 response and included a dramatic increase of long-term memory cells.

Novel insights into their pathobiology are needed for development of better therapies.  We investigated tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets (CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO+, FOXP3+ and PD-1+) and expression of PD-L1 in a series of 32 SCLC BM specimens and four matched primary tumor specimens using immunohistochemistry. 30/32 (93.8 %) BM specimens showed TIL infiltration. CD3+ TILs were observed in 30/32 (93.8 %) BM specimens, CD8+ TILs in 25/32 (78.1 %), CD45RO+ TILs in 15/32 (46.9 %), FOXP3+ TILs in 15/32 (46.9 %) and PD-1+ TILs in 1/32 (3.1 %) BM specimens. Patients with infiltration of CD45RO+ TILS had a significantly longer median survival time (11 months; 95 % CI 0.000-26.148) as compared to patients without the presence of CD45RO+ TILs (5 months; 95 % CI 0.966-9.034; p = 0.007; log rank test). Membranous PD-L1 on tumor cells was observed in 24/32 (75.0 %) BM specimens, with 11/32 (34.4 %) cases showing PD-L1 expression in over 5 % of viable BM tumor cells. PD-L1 expression on TILs was seen in 8/32 (25.0 %) and on tumor infiltrating macrophages in 9/32 (28.1 %) cases. Patients with PD-L1 expression on TILs presented with improved survival prognosis (6 versus 29 months; p = 0.002; log rank test). Among matched primary tumors, all (4/4; 100 %) specimens showed TIL infiltration, while PD-L1 expression found in only 1/4 (25.0 %) specimen. TIL infiltration and PD-L1 expression are commonly found in SCLC BM and presence of CD45RO+ memory T-cells and PD-L1+ TILs in SCLC BM seem to associate with favorable survival times.

Objective: To provide a clinical and pathologic description of the lichenoid mucocutaneous adverse effects seen in patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants: Patients with advanced cancer who were referred to dermatology at Yale-New Haven Hospital, a tertiary care hospital, after developing cutaneous adverse effects while receiving an anti-PD-1 or PD-L1  antibody therapy either as monotherapy or in combination with another agent were  identified. Medical records from 2010 to 2015 and available skin biopsy specimens were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographic characteristics, concurrent medications, therapeutic regimen, type of disease, previous oncologic therapies,  clinical morphology of cutaneous lesions, treatment of rash, peripheral blood eosinophil count, tumor response, and skin histologic characteristics if biopsies were available. Results: Patients were 13 men and 7 women, with a mean (range) age of 64 (46-86)  years. The majority of cases (16 [80%]) had a clinical morphology consisting of erythematous papules with scale in a variety of distributions.

Eighteen patients were treated with topical corticosteroids, and only 1 patient required discontinuation of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Only 4 of 20 patients (20%) developed peripheral eosinophilia. Sixteen patients (80%) were concurrently taking medications that have been previously reported to cause lichenoid drug eruptions. Papular and nodular eruptions with scale, as well as mucosal erosions, with lichenoid features on histologic analysis were a distinct  finding seen with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies and were generally manageable with topical steroids. Concurrent medications may play a role in the development of this cutaneous adverse effect."

Soluble PD-1 (sPD-1) can be detected in the blood, and preclinical evidence suggests that sPD-1 blocks PD-1/-L1 interaction and improves anti-tumor immunity. The present study compares the concentration of sPD-1 in the serum of advanced NSCLC patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prior to erlotinib treatment and at the time of progression and correlates these results to patient outcome. Blood samples from 38 patients with EGFR-mutated advanced  NSCLC treated with erlotinib were analyzed for sPD-1 by sandwich ELISA. EGFR mutational status was assessed in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and tumor biopsies. sPD-1 could be detected in 21% of patients prior to erlotinib treatment, and at disease progression in 37% (p=0.015). An increase in sPD-1 during erlotinib therapy was found in 34%, a decrease in 8% and no change in 58% of patients. An increase in sPD-1 during treatment was associated with prolonged progression-free (adjusted HR 0.32, p=0.013) and overall survival (adjusted HR 0.33, p=0.006), but not associated with the emergence of EGFR T790M mutation in ctDNA at progression or any clinicopathological factors. CONCLUSION: Patients with an increase in sPD-1 during erlotinib treatment have a  more favorable outcome. Our results emphasize the vast clinical impact of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, and support the existing preclinical evidence in the bioactive function of sPD-1."

Several PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays with custom reagents and scoring-criteria are developed in parallel. Biomarker testing and clinical decision making would profit from harmonized PD-L1 diagnostics. To assess interobserver concordance and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining patterns, 15 pulmonary carcinoma resection specimens (adenocarcinoma: n=11, squamous-cell carcinoma: n=4) were centrally stained with the assays 28-8, 22C3, SP142, and SP263 according to clinical trial  protocols. The slides were evaluated independently by nine pathologists. Proportions of PD-L1-positive carcinoma cells and immune cells were scored according to a 6-step system that integrates the criteria employed by the four PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays. Proportion scoring of PD-L1-positive carcinoma cells showed moderate interobserver concordance coefficients for the 6-step scoring system (Light's kappa=0.47-0.50). The integrated dichotomous proportion cut-offs (≥1, ≥5, ≥10, ≥50%) showed good concordance coefficients (κ=0.6-0.8). Proportion scoring of PD-L1-positive immune cells yielded low interobserver concordance coefficients both for the 6-step-score (κ<0.2) and the dichotomous cut-offs (κ=0.12-0.25). The assays 28-8 and 22C3 stained similar proportions of carcinoma cells in 12 of 15 cases. SP142 stained fewer carcinoma cells compared to 28-8, 22C3, and SP263 in four cases, whereas SP263 stained more carcinoma cells in nine cases. SP142 and SP263 stained immune cells more intensely. The data indicate that carcinoma cells can be reproducibly scored in PD-L1 immunohistochemistry for pulmonary adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma. No differences in interobserver concordance were noticed among the tested assays. The scoring of immune cells yielded low concordance rates and might require specific standardization. The four tested PD-L1 assays did not show comparable staining patterns in all cases. Thus, studies that correlate staining patterns and response to immunotherapy are required to test the significance of the observed differences."

Cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are the two most commonly targeted immune checkpoint molecules.  Although the role of antibodies that target CTLA-4 and PD-1 has been established  in solid tumor malignancies and Food and Drug Administration approved for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, there remains a desperate need to incorporate immune checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies. Unlike solid tumors, a number of considerations must be addressed to appropriately employ immune checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies. For example, hematologic malignancies frequently obliterate the bone marrow and lymph nodes, which are critical immune organs that must be restored for appropriate response to immune checkpoint inhibition. On the other hand, hematologic malignancies are  the quintessential immune responsive tumor type, as proven by the success of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in hematologic malignancies. Also, sharing an immune cell lineage, malignant hematologic cells often express immune checkpoint molecules that are absent in solid tumor cells, thereby offering direct targets for immune checkpoint inhibition. A number of clinical trials have demonstrated the potential for immune checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies before and after allo-SCT. The ongoing clinical studies  and complimentary immune correlatives are providing a growing body of knowledge regarding the role of immune checkpoint inhibition in hematologic malignancies, which will likely become part of the standard of care for hematologic malignancies."

Blocking these molecules allowed the reactivation of anti-tumor T cells. Clinically, the administration of anti-CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab: Yervoy®) was granted marketing authorization for patients with metastatic melanoma. The anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab: Opdivo®, pembrolizumab: Keytruda®) have demonstrated clinical efficacy when compared to the standard therapy in metastatic melanomas, advanced lung cancers and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In phase I and II clinical trials, other tumors  (Hodgkin's disease, head and neck cancers, bladder cancer, gastric cancer, etc.)  appear to be responsive to these immunomodulators. These treatments were associated with the occurrence of side effects dominated by autoimmunity predictable by unlocking the breaks exerted by immune system to maintain tolerance against self-antigen.

The most important prognostic factors remain stage of the disease at diagnosis and performance status. For years, the only approved systemic therapy for NSCLC patients was chemotherapy. Despite attempts at defining factors that influence efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, pemetrexed is the only chemotherapy drug that has differential activity based on a specific factor. In recent years, there is increasing focus on defining the molecular alterations critical to the oncogenic phenotype of NSCLC and targeting these alterations for therapeutic benefit.

Pembrolizumab and other immunocheckpoint-blocking monoclonal antibodies work by modulating a patient's own immune system to increase anti-tumor activity. While immunocheckpoint blockade has shown promising results, only 20-40 % of patients experience objective clinical benefit. Differences in individual tumor biology and the presence multiple immune checkpoints present a challenge for treatment. Because radiotherapy has immunomodulatory effects on the tumor microenvironment, it has the potential to synergize with immunotherapy and augment tumor response. NCT02318771 is a phase 1 clinical trial designed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of radiation therapy in combination with pembrolizumab. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 64-year-old male with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma, Fuhrman grade 4, pathologically staged as T3 N0. Metastatic disease was well controlled for several years with sunitinib. Following disease progression, he was switched to axitinib. When disease progression continued, the patient was enrolled in NCT02318771, a phase 1 clinical trial combining radiotherapy and pembrolizumab. The patient experienced unusually rapid disease progression during treatment, which was confirmed by repeated CT scans to rule out pseudoprogression. Tissue biopsies and peripheral blood draws were obtained before, during, and after treatment. Samples were analyzed to provide plausible rationale for rapid treatment failure. Biomarker analysis demonstrated an absence of TILs, which may be a cause of treatment failure as pembrolizumab works through T cell-dependent mechanisms.

So far, a number of clinical trials on nivolumab have showed satisfactory efficacy in treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, we present a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of nivolumab for previously treated advanced NSCLC patients. Electronic databases were searched for eligible literature. Data of objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate, overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse effects (AEs) were extracted and pooled. Outcomes analyzed and presented in this study were according to the original data from nivolumab 3 mg/kg. In general, nine trials with 817 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled ORR, disease control rate, 1-year overall survival rate, and 1-year progression-free survival rate were 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17%-23%), 36% (95% CI: 22%-51%), 47% (95% CI: 40%-53%), 21% (95% CI: 18%-24%), respectively. In addition, the rate of grade 3-4 AEs was only 8% (95% CI: 6%-12%). Subgroup analysis showed no significant difference in terms of ORR between squamous and non-squamous NSCLC (odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI: 0.63-2.39, P=0.51). However, significantly greater ORR was presented in programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive cohort (ORR 31%, 95% CI: 24%-38%), compared to PD-L1 negative cohort (ORR 12%, 95% CI: 9%-17%). The odds ratio for objective response to nivolumab in PD-L1 positive cases relative to negative cases was 3.08 (95% CI: 1.87-5.08, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, nivolumab is a promising second-line agent for previously treated advanced NSCLC with manageable AEs. Both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients showed similar efficacy. In addition, patients with positive PD-L1 expression had better response from nivolumab.

To determine the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors within clinically relevant molecular subgroups, we retrospectively evaluated response patterns among EGFR-mutant, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, and EGFR wild-type/ALK-negative patients. We identified 58 patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Objective response rates (ORR) were assessed using RECIST v1.1. PD-L1 expression and CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were evaluated by IHC. Objective responses were observed in 1 of 28 (3.6%) EGFR-mutant or ALK-positive patients versus 7 of 30 (23.3%) EGFR wild-type and ALK-negative/unknown patients (P = 0.053). The ORR among never- or light- (≤10 pack years) smokers was 4.2% versus 20.6% among heavy smokers (P = 0.123). In an  independent cohort of advanced EGFR-mutant (N = 68) and ALK-positive (N = 27) patients, PD-L1 expression was observed in 24%/16%/11% and 63%/47%/26% of pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) biopsies using cutoffs of ≥1%, ≥5%, and ≥50%  tumor cell staining, respectively. Among EGFR-mutant patients with paired, pre- and post-TKI-resistant biopsies (N = 57), PD-L1 expression levels changed after resistance in 16 (28%) patients. Concurrent PD-L1 expression (≥5%) and high levels of CD8(+) TILs (grade ≥2) were observed in only 1 pretreatment (2.1%) and  5 resistant (11.6%) EGFR-mutant specimens and was not observed in any ALK-positive, pre- or post-TKI specimens. NSCLCs harboring EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements are associated with low ORRs to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Low rates of concurrent PD-L1 expression  and CD8(+) TILs within the tumor microenvironment may underlie these clinical observations."

The mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance remain elusive. Here we report that cell-intrinsic expression of PD1 and PD-L1, two immune checkpoints, is required for sustained expansion of SCLC cells under cisplatin selection. Indeed, PD1 and  PD-L1 were expressed at a higher level in lung cancer cell lines, tumor tissues,  and importantly, in SCLC cells resistant to cisplatin (H69R, H82R), when compared to respective controls. Genetic abrogation of PD1 and PD-L1 in H69R and H82R cells decreased their proliferation rate, and restored their sensitivity to cisplatin. Mechanistically, PD-L1 upregulation in H69R and H82R cells was attributed to the overexpression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) or receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, as knockdown of DNMT1 or KIT in H69R and H82R cells led to PD-L1 downregulation. Consequently, combined knockdown of PD-L1 with KIT or DNMT1 resulted in more pronounced inhibition of H69R and H82R cell growth. Thus, cell intrinsic PD1/PD-L1 signaling may be a predictor for poor efficacy of cisplatin treatment, and targeting the cellular PD1/PD-L1 axis may improve chemosensitization of aggressive SCLC."

Furthermore, our understanding of the diversity of the NSCLC tumor immune microenvironment remains limited. METHODS. We performed comprehensive flow cytometric immunoprofiling on both tumor and immune cells from 51 NSCLCs and integrated this analysis with clinical and histopathologic characteristics, next-generation sequencing, mRNA expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS. Cytometric profiling identified an immunologically hot cluster with abundant CD8+ T cells expressing high levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 and an immunologically cold cluster with lower relative abundance of CD8+ T cells and expression of inhibitory markers. The hot cluster was highly enriched for expression of genes associated with T cell trafficking and cytotoxic function and high PD-L1 expression by IHC. There was no correlation between immunophenotype and KRAS or EGFR mutation, or patient smoking history, but we did observe an enrichment of squamous subtype and tumors with higher mutation burden in the hot cluster.

Therefore, identifying the ideal biomarkers for patient selection would be of great value in optimizing and personalizing immunotherapy. The utility of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker has varied in different clinical trials and immunohistochemistry assays. In addition, the response to immune checkpoint inhibition has been complicated by PD-L1 expression as a marker influenced by the dynamic tumor microenvironment. No consensus has yet been reached on whether PD-L1 expression is an ideal marker for patient selection.

Long thought to be nonimmunogenic, immunotherapy in lung cancer has historically been met with disappointing results. Programmed death-1 (PD-1), and  the PD-1 ligand, PD-L1, are immune checkpoint proteins that fine-tune the antigen-specific T-cell response after stimulation of the T-cell receptor and are crucial for self-tolerance. This pathway in particular is co-opted by tumors through expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface and within the tumor microenvironment, allowing for direct suppression of antitumor cytolytic T-cell activity by the tumor. Indeed, induction of the PD1/PD-L1 pathway represents an adaptive immune resistance mechanism exerted by tumor cells in response to endogenous antitumor activity. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two immuno-oncology agents, the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab, for the treatment of previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Coincident with the clinical trials that led to these regulatory approvals has been the development of several immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests of PD-L1 expression, which may serve to select patients who will derive the most benefit from PD1- or PD-L1-directed therapy. The PD-L1 IHC assays are distinct in their methods and interpretation, which poses a challenge to clinicians selecting patients for these therapies."

The advent of nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody against Program Death-1 (PD-1), has substantially changed the outlook for such patients. AREA COVERED: Nivolumab is the first checkpoint immunotherapeutic agent to gain regulatory approval for NSCLC. By enabling host immune-mediated cytotoxic activity against tumor cells, nivolumab induces a partial or complete tumor response in 15-20% of patients, regardless of number of previous lines of anti-cancer therapy. Nivolumab-related adverse effects are generally milder and less frequent than those observed with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although immune-related adverse events such as fatal pneumonitis have been reported with nivolumab therapy, most adverse events are reversible with a prompt immunosuppression. Studies investigating nivolumab in combination with other agents are ongoing. Expert commentary: Nivolumab represents a significant breakthrough in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Its therapeutic role for NSCLC may soon expand to include consolidation or maintenance setting. Furthermore, several clinical trials investigating the combination of nivolumab with other immunologic or non-immunologic treatments are ongoing and these will likely result in additional roles of nivolumab in NSCLC."

In this study, we developed an anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody (with biosimilarity to nivolumab) and examined the effects of the antibody on PBMCs derived from cancer patients. Specifically, we investigated the effects of the anti-PD-1 antibody on proliferation, cytokine production, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and regulatory T cells. These investigations yielded several important results. First, the anti-PD-1 antibody had no obvious effect on resting PBMCs; however, high levels of the anti-PD-1 antibody partly stimulated PBMC proliferation when accompanied by an anti-CD3 antibody. Second, the anti-PD-1 antibody restored the growth inhibition of anti-CD3 Ab-stimulated PBMCs mediated by PD-L1. Third, the anti-PD-1 antibody exhibited a moderate inhibitory effect on the induction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) by anti-CD3 antibody stimulation. Additionally, the presence of the anti-PD-1 antibody promoted antigen-specific CTL induction, which suggests that combining anti-PD-1 antibody and conventional immunotherapy treatments may have beneficial  effects. These results indicate that specific cellular immunological mechanisms are partly responsible for the antitumor effect exhibited by the anti-PD-1 antibody against advanced cancers in clinical trials."

Fifty-two patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity; postprogression treatment was permitted per protocol. The primary objective was to assess safety; secondary objectives included objective response rate (ORR) and 24-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate; overall survival (OS) was an exploratory end point. Any-grade treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 71% of patients, most commonly: fatigue (29%), rash (19%), nausea (14%), diarrhea (12%), pruritus (12%), and arthralgia (10%). Ten patients (19%) reported grade 3 to 4 treatment-related AEs; grade 3 rash was the only grade 3 to 4 event occurring in  more than one patient (n = 2; 4%). Six patients (12%) discontinued because of a treatment-related AE. The confirmed ORR was 23% (12 of 52), including four ongoing complete responses. Nine of 12 responses (75%) occurred by first tumor assessment (week 11); eight (67%) were ongoing (range, 5.3+ to 25.8+ months) at the time of data lock. ORR was 28% (nine of 32) in patients with any degree of tumor PD-ligand 1 expression and 14% (two of 14) in patients with no PD-ligand 1  expression. Median PFS was 3.6 months, and the 24-week PFS rate was 41% (95% CI,  27 to 54). Median OS was 19.4 months, and the 1-year and 18-month OS rates were 73% (95% CI, 59 to 83) and 57% (95% CI, 42 to 70), respectively. CONCLUSION: First-line nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and durable responses in first-line advanced NSCLC."

These immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have already obtained approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, advanced/refractory non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell cancer. ICBs enhance immune responses against cancer cells but can also lead to inflammatory side effects called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Such toxicities are distinct from those associated with traditional chemotherapeutic agents or molecularly targeted therapies. Although severe irAEs  remain rare (~10% of cases under monotherapy), they can become life-threatening if not anticipated and managed appropriately. As malignancies are frequently diagnosed in older patients, ICB treatment of elderly presents a unique challenge. However, the knowledge about efficacy and toxicity of these molecules  in this specific population is limited, as most of the studies have involved a low number of older patients. In this review, we will discuss about the different ICB efficacy data available for older patients. We will then highlight the specific spectrum of immunotherapy toxicities and talk about their management in  the context of older adults."

However, the rational use of these agents has been limited by the lack of a definitive predictive biomarker. OBSERVATIONS: Tumor PD-L1 expression is associated with an increased likelihood of NSCLC response to these agents, although responses can still occur at a low rate in PD-L1-negative tumors. The use of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker for use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is limited by the multitude of PD-L1 antibodies, assays, scoring systems, and thresholds for positivity currently used. Alternative biomarkers such as tumor neoantigens identified through whole-exome sequencing and clinical parameters (eg, smoking or oncogene driver status) may also have predictive value. Biomarkers that can direct the rational use of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are crucial given the risk of life-threatening immune-related complications associated with these therapies and the reality that most patients still do not benefit from their use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The refinement of existing biomarkers and identification of novel predictive biomarkers will be key to ensuring the effective and safe use of these agents. Since most patients still do not benefit  from these agents, it is critical to continue to work to define the select patient population who will derive durable benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and identify markers that could have predictive value for combination therapies that  could expand the population who benefit."

Pulmonary Sarcomatoid carcinomas consist of a rare subset of highly aggressive and poorly differentiated non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), with poor prognosis and chemo-resistance. Although exhibiting high expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), their sensitivity to inhibitors of PD-1/PD-L1 axis is still unknown. Here we report a case of lung sarcomatoid carcinoma with Nivolumab dramatic and long-lasting efficacy, but occurrence of a very specific pattern of  lung toxicity, the so-called 'organizing bronchiolitis syndrome'. As more and more NSCLC patients are promised to receive PD-1 inhibitors as part of their treatment, we feel that specific features of such Nivolumab-induced organizing pneumonitis should be known. Although corticosteroid sensitivity is high, recurrence is frequent because of premature steroid tapering, as for all other causes of organizing pneumonias, and probably because of the Nivolumab long tissue half-life."

The expression of PD-1/L1 was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in patients with TM or TC treated with chemotherapy between 2000 and 2014. Using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples and a PD-L1 antibody, the expression of PD-L1 in the TM and TC specimens was reported in terms of the H-score (0-300), with a score ≥1 being defined as positive. The PD-1 expression in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells was evaluated based on the intensity (0-3) of staining using a PD-1 antibody. The objective response rate, progression-free  survival, and the difference in PD-1/L1 expression between the pre/post chemotherapy were evaluated. Thirty patients (TM/TC 12/18) were evaluated. PD-L1 positivity were TM/TC 67%/41%. Within the PD-L1 positive/negative populations, the objective response rates were 50%/0% for TM and 14%/20% for TC. No significant differences  in progression-free survival were seen according to the PD-L1 expression status.  Increases in both the PD-L1 and PD-1 scores were observed after chemotherapy in six serial pre/post chemotherapy TM specimens, with a mean PD-L1 score and a median PD-1 intensity of 42/93, and 0/2.5, respectively. The substantially high expression of PD-L1 and the increase in PD-L1 and PD-1 expression after chemotherapy supports anti-PD-1/L1 drugs therapy for TM and TC as well as the development of a strategy for its sequential use after chemotherapy."

Two blocking antibodies for PD-1, nivolumab and pembrolizumab have recently been approved for treating advanced recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on tumor cells or antigen presenting cells leads to T cell exhaustion and ultimately tumor growth. In this  study, we performed flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood samples collected from patients with advanced NSCLC at initial diagnosis. We report that surface expression of PD-1 on CD4+ T cells has a prognostic value in NSCLC patients, as high expression of PD-1 is associated with a shorter progression-free survival and overall survival. Importantly, we also found that high PD-1 expression on peripheral CD4+ T cells is associated with inferior clinical response in a subset of patients who received anti-PD-L1 treatment, indicating a potential predictive  value of this marker.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were analyzed by CellSearch with anti-human B7-H1/PD-L1 PE-conjugated antibody. PD-L1 expressing CTCs were assessed at baseline, at 3 and 6 months after starting therapy, and correlated with outcome. At baseline and at 3 months of treatment, the presence of CTCs and the expression of PD-L1 on their surface were found associated to poor patients outcome. Nevertheless, the high frequency of PD-L1 expressing CTCs  hampered to discriminate the role of PD-L1 in defining prognosis. Conversely although CTCs were found in all patients 6 months after treatment, at this time patients could be dichotomized into two groups based PD-L1 expression on CTCs. Patients with PD-L1 negative CTCs all obtained a clinical benefit, while patients with PD-L1 (+) CTCs all experienced progressive disease.

In this study, we tested whether strategies that increase T-cell infiltration to tumors can be efficacious in enhancing immunotherapy response. We performed an unbiased screen to identify FDA-approved oncology agents with an ability to enhance T-cell chemokine expression with the goal of identifying agents capable of augmenting immunotherapy response. Identified agents were tested in multiple lung tumor models as single agents and  in combination with PD-1 blockade. Additional molecular and cellular analysis of  tumors was used to define underlying mechanisms. We found that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi) increased expression of multiple T-cell chemokines in cancer cells, macrophages, and T cells. Using the HDACi romidepsin in vivo, we observed increased chemokine expression, enhanced T-cell infiltration, and T-cell-dependent tumor regression.  Importantly, romidepsin significantly enhanced the response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in multiple lung tumor models, including nearly complete rejection  in two models. Combined romidepsin and PD-1 blockade also significantly enhanced  activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells. These results provide evidence for a novel role of HDACs in modulating T-cell chemokine expression in multiple cell types. In addition, our findings indicate that pharmacologic induction of T-cell chemokine expression represents a conceptually novel approach for enhancing immunotherapy response. Finally, these results suggest that combination of HDAC inhibitors with PD-1 blockade represents a promising strategy for lung cancer treatment."

Overexpression of PD-L1 in cancers such as  gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and bladder cancer is associated with  poor clinical outcomes. In contrast, PD-L1 expression correlates with better clinical outcomes in breast cancer and merkel cell carcinoma. The prognostic value of PD-L1 expression in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma is controversial. Blocking antibodies that target PD-1 and PD-L1 have achieved remarkable response rates in cancer patients who have PD-L1-overexpressing tumors. However, using PD-L1 as an exclusive predictive biomarker for cancer immunotherapy is questionable due to the low accuracy of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining. Factors that affect the accuracy of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry staining are as follows. First, antibodies used in different studies have different sensitivity. Second, in different studies, the cut-off value of PD-L1 staining positivity is different. Third, PD-L1 expression in tumors is not uniform, and sampling time and location may affect the results of PD-L1 staining. Therefore, better understanding of tumor microenvironment and use of other biomarkers such as gene marker and combined index are necessary to better identify patients who will benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade therapy."

The next steps should be the identification of reliable predictors for benefit from immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors and the pursuit of well-designed combination therapies. In this article, we review the rationale for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC, the data from phase I and randomized clinical trials, and future directions."

The treatment of advanced stage tumors usually involves the use of systemic agents that may be associated with significant risk of toxicity, especially in older patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are newcomers to the oncology world with improved efficacy and better  safety profiles when compared to traditional cytotoxic drugs. This makes them an  attractive treatment option. While there are no elderly specific trials, this review attempts to look at the current available data from a geriatric oncology perspective. We reviewed data from phase III studies that led to newly approved indications of checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal cell cancer. Data were reviewed with respect to response, survival, and toxicity according to three groups: <65 years, 65-75 years, and >75 years. Current literature does not allow one to draw definitive conclusions regarding the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in older adults. However, they may offer a potentially less toxic but equally efficacious treatment option for the senior  adult oncology patient."

Numerous ongoing studies are expected to establish the worth of PD-1 pathway inhibitors in other tumor types as well as in combinations with approved agents. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a complex group of malignancies characterized by profound immunosuppression and is  an excellent candidate for investigation in this exciting field. However, given the fact that a subset of patients will likely benefit, it is critical to focus on biomarker development for appropriate patient selection and facilitation of trial design. As immunotherapy is settling in cancer treatment, immune checkpoint inhibitors are emerging as one of the most promising agents."

While immunohistochemical detection of PD-L1 was introduced as a predictive biomarker with variable power, much less is known about copy number alterations (CNA) affecting PD-L1 and their associations with expression levels, mutational load, and survival. To gain insight, we employed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets to comprehensively analyze 22 major cancer types for PD-L1 CNAs. We observed a diverse landscape of PD-L1 CNAs, which affected focal regions, chromosome 9p or the entire chromosome 9. Deletions of PD-L1 were more frequent than gains (31% vs. 12%) with deletions being most prevalent in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Copy number gains most frequently occurred in ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, cervical and endocervical cancer, sarcomas, and colorectal cancers. Fine-mapping of the genetic architecture revealed specific recurrently amplified and deleted core regions across cancers with putative biological and clinical consequences. PD-L1 CNAs correlated significantly with PD-L1 mRNA expression changes in many cancer types, and tumors with PD-L1 gains harbored significantly higher mutational load compared to non-amplified cases (median: 78 non-synonymous mutations vs. 40, P = 7.1e-69). Moreover, we observed that, in general, both PD-L1 amplifications and deletions were associated with dismal prognosis. In conclusion, PD-L1 CNAs, in particular PD-L1 copy number gains, represent frequent genetic alterations across many cancers, which influence PD-L1 expression levels, are associated with higher mutational loads, and may be exploitable as predictive biomarker for immunotherapy regimens."

Several drugs targeting PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) or PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved or are in the late stages of development. Inevitably, the introduction of these drugs will put pressure on healthcare systems, and there is a need to stratify patients to identify those who are most likely to benefit from such treatment. There is evidence that responsiveness to PD-1 inhibitors may be predicted by expression of PD-L1 on neoplastic cells. Hence, there is considerable interest in using PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining to guide the use of PD-1-targeted treatments in patients with NSCLC. This article reviews the current knowledge about PD-L1 testing, and identifies current research requirements. Key factors to consider include the source and timing of sample collection, pre-analytical steps (sample  tracking, fixation, tissue processing, sectioning, and tissue prioritization), analytical decisions (choice of biomarker assay/kit and automated staining platform, with verification of standardized assays or validation of laboratory-devised techniques, internal and external quality assurance, and audit), and reporting and interpretation of the results. This review addresses the need for integration of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry with other tests as part of locally agreed pathways and protocols.

We retrospectively reviewed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in five patients with advanced NSCLC and new/progressing intracranial metastases. Intracranial response was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using mRECIST v. 1.1 criteria. All patients had parenchymal brain metastases; two patients had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis diagnosed according to radiological criteria. All patients were asymptomatic and did not require corticosteroids or immediate local therapy. We observed one complete and one partial response in the brain. Stabilization of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis for 10 weeks was achieved in one additional patient. Two patients progressed in the CNS. Time-to-response comprised 5 weeks and 9 weeks; both responses are still ongoing at the time of the report (24+ and 28+ weeks since start of treatment). Systemic responses and intracranial responses were largely concordant. No treatment-related or CNS metastases-related grade≥3 adverse events were observed. Nivolumab might have intracranial activity and favorable safety profile in patients with CNS metastases secondary to NSCLC. Nivolumab CNS activity warrants  further evaluation."

We evaluated the relationships between PD-L1 positivity, several clinical factors and the immunohistochemical expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem cell and proliferative markers. PD-L1 was expressed in 22% of lung adenocarcinomas and 60% of squamous cell lung cancers.

Therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway are an emerging treatment for lung cancer. By characterizing intra-tumoral immune infiltration and evaluating PD-L1 expression, it could be possible to predict the efficacy of these new treatments. From 1997 to 2013, data from all patients with SC who underwent lung resection was collected. Tumor-immune infiltration and PD-L1 expression were studied by immunochemistry tests, analyzing CD3 (clone SP7), CD4  (clone 1F6), CD8 (clone C8/144b), CD20 (clone L26), CD163 (clone 10D6), MPO (clone 59A5), and PD-L1 (clone 5H1). Results were compared to those of 54 NSCLC. In total, 75 SC were included. Forty (53%) SC expressed PD-L1 vs 11 NSCLC (20%) (p<0.0001). CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages were more important in SC than in NSCLC (median 23%  [17-30] of tumoral surface vs 17% [7-27], p=0.011 and 23% [17-30] vs 20% [13-23], p=0.002, respectively). In SC, the presence of Kirsten Ras (KRAS) mutations, blood vessel invasion, and TTF1+ positivity were associated with PDL1 expression. On multivariate analysis, only CD163+ macrophages and blood-vessel invasion were  associated with tumoral PD-L1 expression. High levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3+ or CD4+ and not CD8+) constituted a factor of good prognosis on survival. Interestingly, PD-L1 expression distinguishes subpopulations within tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3+ or CD4+) with different prognosis PD-L1 expression was higher in SC than in NSCLC as well as immune-cell infiltration by TCD3 cells and macrophages. This suggests that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could represent a new potential therapy."

However, whether anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody  therapy can provide added benefits for heavily pretreated patients with advanced  NSCLC and whether the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy relates to the tumor PD-L1 expression level remain controversial. Thus, this meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy for pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC. Randomized clinical trials were retrieved by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, ASCO meeting abstract, clinicaltrial.gov, and Cochrane library databases. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and odds ratios for the overall response rate and adverse events  (AEs) were calculated by STATA software. Three randomized clinical trials involving 1141 pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC were included. These trials all compared the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (nivolumab and MPDL3280A) with docetaxel. The results suggested that, for all patients, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy could acquire a greater overall response (odds ratio = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.08-2.07, P = 0.015, P for  heterogeneity [Ph] = 0.620) and longer OS (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61-0.81, P < 0.001, Ph = 0.361) than docetaxel, but not PFS (HR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65-1.06, P = 0.134; Ph = 0.031). Subgroup analyses according to the tumor PD-L1 expression level showed that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy could significantly improve both OS and PFS in patients with high expressions of PD-L1, but not in those with low expressions. Generally, the rates of grade 3 or 4 AEs of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy  were significantly lower than that of docetaxel. However, the risks of pneumonitis and hypothyroidism were significantly higher. CONCLUSION: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy may significantly improve the outcomes for pretreated advanced NSCLC patients, with a better safety profile than docetaxel."

However, few studies have been performed in EC. The purpose of the present study was to assess the expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 in 35 human normal endometrial tissue samples and 75 human EC tissue samples using immunohistochemical staining. It was found that 61.3% of ECs were positive for PD-1 staining, which was almost exclusively found in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells. By contrast, PD-1 was not expressed in the tumor cells or normal endometrial tissues. It was also found that 14.3% of normal endometria and 17.3%  of EC tissues were positive for PD-L1 expression, while 20.0% of normal endometrium and 37.3% of EC tissues were positive for PD-L2 expression; however,  there was no statistically significant difference between the normal endometrium  and EC tissues. PD-1 expression in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells was more frequently found in the moderately and poorly-differentiated ECs and non-endometrioid (type II) ECs than in the well-differentiated ECs and endometrioid (type I) ECs. Similarly, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in the tumor-infiltrating immune cells was more frequently found in the moderately and poorly-differentiated ECs and type II ECs than in the type I ECs.

Experimental Design: From 12,580 post mortem cases, we identified 214 patients with untreated metastatic LC, of which 98 had adequately preserved tissues to construct a syngeneic primary LC/metastasis tissue microarray. Immunostaining for PD-L1 and 2 was evaluated in paired primary and metastatic lesions and correlated with clinicopathologic features. Results: We included 98 patients with non-small  cell (NSCLC, n = 65, 66%), small cell histology (SCLC, n = 29, 30%) and four (4%) atypical carcinoids (AC). In total 8/65 (12%) primary PD-L1 positive NSCLC, had discordant matched metastases (14/17, 82%). PD-L1 negative primaries had universally concordant distant metastases. SCLCs were universally PD-L1 negative  across primary and metastatic disease.

We found no correlation between the expression of PD ligands and clinicopathologic features of LC. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity in the expression of PD  ligands is common in NSCLC, while PD-L1 is homogeneously undetectable in primary  and metastatic SCLC. This holds implications in the clinical development of immune response biomarkers in LC."

Amongst those, programmed death-1 (PD-1) is one of the most recognized negative regulators of T cell function. In non-small lung cancers (NSCLCs), the aberrant activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is known to induce PD-L1 expression and further the treatment with gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  (TKI) for EGFR, decrease the expression of PD-L1 on NSCLC. Given the acquired resistance to gefitinib treatment frequently observed by developing secondary-site mutations limiting its efficacy, it is important to understand the downstream mechanism of activated-EGFR signaling for regulating PD-L1 in NSCLC. In this study, we demonstrated that AKT-STAT3 pathway could be a potential target for regulating the surface expression of PD-L1 on NSCLCs with aberrant EGFR activity and, further, the inhibition of AKT or STAT3 activity could down-regulate the expression of PD-L1 even in gefitinib-resistant NSCLCs. These results highlight an importance of AKT-STAT3 pathway as a promising target for potentiating anti-tumor immune responses by regulating PD-L1 expression on cancer cells with aberrant EGFR activity."

However, only a select group of patients respond to these interventions. The identification of biomarkers that predict clinical benefit to immune checkpoint blockade is critical to successful  clinical translation of these agents. We conducted an integrated analysis of three independent large datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas of lung adenocarcinoma and two datasets from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), Profiling of Resistance Patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax (named PROSPECT) and Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination (named BATTLE-1). Comprehensive analysis of mRNA gene expression, reverse-phase protein array, IHC, and correlation with clinical data were performed. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with an inflammatory tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma, independent of tumor  mutational burden. We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT phenotype. Furthermore, we identify B7-H3 as a prognostic marker for NSCLC. The strong association between EMT status and an inflammatory tumor  microenvironment with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules warrants further investigation of using EMT as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade agents and other immunotherapies in NSCLC and possibly a broad range of other cancers."

T-cell checkpoint blockade may improve patient survival. However, checkpoint molecules on cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell, a non-specific adoptive immunotherapy, remain unknown. In present study, we detected the dynamic expression of eight major checkpoint molecules (CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM- 3, CEACAM-1, LAG-3, TIGIT and BTLA) on CIK cells from NSCLC patients. The majority of these molecules, except BTLA, were sharply elevated during the early stage of CIK cell culture. Thereafter, PD-1 and TIGIT expressions decreased gradually towards the initial level (day 0). Moreover, CTLA-4 faded away during the later stage of CIK culture. LAG-3 expression decreased but was still significantly higher than the initial level. Of note, PD-L1 remained stably upregulated during CIK culture compared with PD-1, indicating that PD-L1 might act as an inhibitory molecule on CIK cells instead of PD-1. Furthermore, TIM-3 and CEACAM1 were strongly expressed simultaneously during long-term CIK culture and showed a significant and mutually positive correlation. BTLA displayed a distinct pattern, and its expression gradually decreased throughout the CIK culture. These observations suggested that CIK cells might be partly exhausted before clinical transfusion, characterized by the high  expression of PD-L1, LAG-3, TIM- 3, and CEACAM-1 and the low expression of TIGIT, BTLA, PD-1, and CTLA-4 compared with initial culture. Our results imply that implementing combined treatment on CIK cells before transfusion via antibodies targeting PD-L1, LAG-3, TIM-3, and CEACAM-1 might improve the efficiency of CIK therapy for NSCLC patients."

Ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen  4 (CTLA-4) antibody and the anti-PD-1 agents nivolumab and pembrolizumab have followed large clinical development programs, therefore, information regarding their safety and toxicity profile is readily available. Unique toxicities have been observed, which stem from and relate to the immune activation by these agents and are thus termed as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Clinicians and patients should be aware of this different toxicity profile, so as to promptly recognize, identify and manage symptoms related to irAEs. Indeed, clinical experience has shown that these immune events, when they are early recognized and timely managed, are mostly reversible otherwise they can evoke severe or even life-threatening situations. Several recommendations and guidelines have been developed for the management of irAEs and algorithms have been published based primarily on our knowledge from the ipilimumab trials."

In recent years, through a better understanding of the interactions between the immune system and tumor cells (TC), immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Chemotherapy has long been reported  to interfere with the immune response to the tumor and conversely, anti-tumor immunity may add to those effects. Anti-tumor vaccines, such as MAGE-A3, Tecetomide, TG4010, CIMAvax, tumor cell vaccines and dendritic cell (DC) vaccines emerged as potent inducers of the immune response against the tumor. More recently the approval of the anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) monoclonal  antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab for previously treated advanced squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, as well as other immune checkpoint inhibitors delivering  promising results, has radically transformed the therapeutic landscape of NSCLC.  Combination strategies now appear as the next step. Notwithstanding these successes, immunotherapy still holds significant drawbacks and currently several  improvements are needed before routine use in clinical practice, including identification of robust biomarkers for optimal patient selection, as well as defining the best way to evaluate response."

However, a definitive antibody and cut-off value for PD-L1 expression are urgently needed. The PD-L1 expression in 40 surgically resected small cell  lung cancer (SCLC) specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with three different antibodies: clones E1L3N, 28-8, and SP142, and using three different evaluations: the Allred score, 1% cut-off, and 5% cut-off. The percentage of tumors with positive PD-L1 expression was inconsistent in the IHC evaluations using the Allred score and 1% cut-off. However, the IHC evaluations using the 5% cut-off showed similar rates of expression using the three different antibodies. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provided detailed evidence on the frequency of PD-L1 expression in surgically resected SCLC, which may be a useful reference  for identifying patients with PD-L1-expressing SCLC."

In an effort to identify possible targets for treatment, we utilized comprehensive genomic profiling in small cell carcinoma of the breast. Under an IRB approved protocol, we identified patients with small cell carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the  lung profiled by Caris Life Sciences between 2007 and 2015. Tumors were assessed  with up to 25 immunohistochemical stains, in situ hybridization of cMET, EGFR, HER2, PIK3CA, and TOP2A, and next generation sequencing as well as Sanger sequencing of 47 genes. 19 patients with small cell carcinoma of the breast were  identified, median age was 58 years (range 37-79) and 42 % had metastatic disease at presentation; for comparison, 58 patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung were identified (66 [36-86], 65 % metastatic). By immunohistochemistry, 31 % of small cell carcinoma of the breast patients expressed ER, 13 % expressed PR, and 16 % expressed AR; small cell carcinoma of the lung patients expressed ER 0 %, PR 2 %, and AR 6 %. Small cell carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung patients had similar patterns of other immunohistochemical  expression (0 v 0 % PDL1, 50 v 42 % PD1, and 77 v 95 % TOP2A, respectively). All  small carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung patients were  negative for HER2 and cMET amplification by in situ hybridization. Next generation sequencing revealed TP53 mutations in 75 % of patients both with small cell carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung and PIK3CA mutations in 33 % of small cell carcinoma of the breast patients but no small cell carcinoma of the lung patients (Fisher's exact test p = 0.005, OR 0.02 [0.00-0.52]). No other mutations were found in small cell carcinoma of the breast patients and no other mutation occurred in over 10 % of small cell carcinoma of the lung patients except RB1 in 19 % (p = 0.31). Small cell carcinoma of the breast is an aggressive tumor with few therapeutic options. Molecular profiling suggests many similarities between small cell carcinoma of the breast and small cell carcinoma of the lung with the exception an increased incidence of PIK3CA mutations in small cell carcinoma of the breast, which may have therapeutic implications."

The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) recently provided a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of EC, offering a new classification of the disease, based on genetic features, which defines four subgroups of cancer rather than the two traditionally recognized. In the molecular classification two types  of EC, the polymerase epsilon (POLE)-ultramutated and the microsatellite instability (MSI)-hypermutated, seem to present an enhanced immune microenvironment and a high mutation burden. The blockade of the immune checkpoints is an innovative approach that has largely demonstrated to be effective in solid malignancies, such as lung, renal and melanoma; it acts by reducing the cancer-induced immune-suppression through inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 (Programmed Death and PD-Ligand) axis. All available evidence supporting an over-expression of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in EC has been reviewed.  In particular in the POLE and MSI ECs an up-regulation of this pathway was found, aiming to suggest a rationale for testing the PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in these cancer subgroups."

PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues has been suggested as a predictive and prognostic marker. We examined the change in PD-L1 expression after gefitinib in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Paired tumor tissues were collected before and after gefitinib from 18 patients. PD-L1 expression on the tumor and immune cells was defined by the H-score of immunohistochemical staining (range, 0-300). The correlations between the change in PD-L1 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells showed an increase in the median H-score from 25 to 40 (P = .067). Of the 18 patients, 7 (38.9%) had a marked increase in  the median H-score (range, 80-180; group A) and 11 (61.1%) had no change in the median H-score (0 for both scores; group B). In groups A and B, the median progression-free survival for gefitinib was 13 and 12 months (P = .594), and the  median overall survival was not reached and 38 months (P = .073), respectively. MET positivity by immunohistochemistry in biopsies after gefitinib therapy was significantly associated with group A (P = .028). The PD-L1 H-score by immunohistochemistry, but not by tumor cells, showed correlations with other immune cells; FOXP3(+) expression in biopsies before gefitinib use, and PD-1(+) and CD3(+) in biopsies after gefitinib therapy, respectively. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression in tumor cells markedly increased in a subset of patients after gefitinib treatment. Thus, rebiopsy should be considered when using PD-L1 expression as a biomarker."

Epub 2016 May 2.","Current Challenges in Cancer Treatment.","PURPOSE: In this review, we highlight the current concepts and discuss some of the current challenges and future prospects in cancer therapy. We frequently use  the example of lung cancer. We conducted a nonsystematic PubMed search, selecting the most comprehensive and relevant research articles, clinical trials, translational papers, and review articles on precision oncology and immuno-oncology. Papers were prioritized and selected based on their originality and potential clinical applicability. FINDINGS: Two major revolutions have changed cancer treatment paradigms in the past few years: targeting actionable alterations in oncogene-driven cancers and immuno-oncology. Important challenges are still ongoing in both fields of cancer  therapy. On the one hand, druggable genomic alterations are diverse and represent only small subsets of patients in certain tumor types, which limits testing their clinical impact in biomarker-driven clinical trials. Next-generation sequencing technologies are increasingly being implemented for molecular prescreening in clinical research, but issues regarding clinical interpretation of large genomic  data make their wide clinical use difficult. Further, dealing with tumor heterogeneity and acquired resistance is probably the main limitation for the success of precision oncology. On the other hand, long-term survival benefits with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-programmed death cell protein-1/programmed death cell ligand-1[PD-1/L1] and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 monoclonal antibodies) are restricted to a minority of patients, and no predictive markers are yet robustly validated that could help us recognize these  subsets and optimize treatment delivery and selection. To achieve long-term survival benefits, drug combinations targeting several molecular alterations or cancer hallmarks might be needed. This will probably be one of the most challenging but promising precision cancer treatment strategies in the future. IMPLICATIONS: Targeting single molecular abnormalities or cancer pathways has achieved good clinical responses that have modestly affected survival in some cancers. However, this approach to cancer treatment is still reductionist, and many challenges need to be met to improve treatment outcomes with our patients."

However, the efficacy of these agents is limited by the development of acquired resistance which occurs after variable periods of time. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to achieve long lasting disease control, as well as new therapies for those patients without targetable driver mutations. A deeper understanding of interactions between the immune system and tumor cells has led to the development of a number of immunotherapeutic agents. We review current data on immunotherapy for lung cancer treatment, with a focus on checkpoint inhibitors and therapeutic vaccines. References for this review were identified through searches of PubMed, congress proceedings and  reference lists from key original and review papers. Expert commentary: While most vaccines have been unsuccessful, inhibitors of specific immune checkpoints,  including CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, have shown significant clinical activity and manageable toxicities and recently, two anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have  been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. Identification of reliable predictive biomarkers for patient selection and novel  rational combinations are currently active areas of research to further improve the efficacy of immunotherapy."

Clinical trials targeting programmed death 1/programmed death ligand  1 (PD1/PDL1) in melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer have reported high response rates, and tumoral PDL1 expression has been suggested as a potential biomarker to enrich for patient response to these treatments. There are only very limited data to date reporting the expression of PDL1 in TNBC. METHODS AND PDL1 immunohistochemistry was performed on 161 primary TNBCs and assessed in the tumour as well as immune cells in the stromal compartment. PDL1 expression was very common in TNBC, expressed in the tumour cell membrane (64%), cytoplasm (80%) and stromal (93%) cellular compartments. Cytoplasmic tumoral expression of PDL1 was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer-specific death [hazard ratio (HR) 0.45, P = 0.035] while stromal PDL1 expression was associated with a lower rate of deaths from all causes (HR 0.305,  P = 0.0042). Membranous expression of PDL1 was not associated with outcome. While both PDL1 expression and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes were associated with a better outcome, only lymphovascular invasion and high tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes were independently prognostic for breast cancer-specific death. CONCLUSION: While PDL1 expression is frequent in TNBC, it was not independently prognostic. There were differences in outcome depending on the cellular compartment of PDL1 expression. These data provide further impetus for investigating the utility of immune checkpoint therapies in TNBC, given the clinical significance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PDL1 expression in this cohort."

FGFR1 is relatively frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast and lung cancer, and FGFR2 in gastric cancer. BCR-FGFR1,  CNTRL-FGFR1, CUX1-FGFR1, FGFR1OP-FGFR1, MYO18A-FGFR1 and ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusions in myeloproliferative neoplasms are non-receptor-type FGFR kinases, whereas FGFR1-TACC1, FGFR2-AFF3, FGFR2-BICC1, FGFR2-PPHLN1, FGFR3-BAIAP2L1 and FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in solid tumors are transmembrane-type FGFRs with C-terminal  alterations. AZD4547, BGJ398 (infigratinib), Debio-1347 and dovitinib are FGFR1/2/3 inhibitors; BLU9931 is a selective FGFR4 inhibitor; FIIN-2, JNJ-42756493, LY2874455 and ponatinib are pan-FGFR inhibitors. AZD4547, dovitinib and ponatinib are multi-kinase inhibitors targeting FGFRs, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)R2, and others. The tumor microenvironment consists of cancer cells and stromal/immune cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, M2-type tumor-associating macrophages (M2-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells. FGFR inhibitors elicit antitumor effects directly on cancer cells, as well as indirectly through the blockade of paracrine signaling.  The dual inhibition of FGF and CSF1 or VEGF signaling is expected to enhance the  antitumor effects through the targeting of immune evasion and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Combination therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FGFR or CSF1R inhibitors) and immune checkpoint blockers (anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies) may be a promising choice for cancer patients. The inhibition of FGF19-FGFR4 signaling is associated with a risk of liver toxicity, whereas the activation of FGF23-FGFR4 signaling is associated with a risk of heart toxicity. Endocrine FGF signaling affects the pathophysiology of cancer patients who are prescribed FGFR inhibitors. Whole-genome sequencing is necessary for the detection of promoter/enhancer alterations of FGFR genes and rare alterations of other genes causing FGFR overexpression. To sustain the health care system in an aging society, a benefit-cost analysis should be performed with a focus on disease-free survival and the total medical cost before implementing genome-based precision medicine for cancer patients."

We aimed to establish the activity and safety of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with untreated brain metastases from melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this non-randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients  aged 18 years or older with melanoma or NSCLC with untreated brain metastases from the Yale Cancer Center. Patients had at least one untreated or progressive brain metastasis between 5 and 20 mm in diameter without associated neurological  symptoms or the need for corticosteroids. Patients with NSCLC had tumour tissue positive for PD-L1 expression; this was not required for patients with melanoma.  Patients were given 10 mg/kg pembrolizumab every 2 weeks until progression. The primary endpoint was brain metastasis response assessed in all treated patients.  The trial is ongoing and here we present an early analysis. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02085070. FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2014, and May 31, 2015, we screened 52 patients with  untreated or progressive brain metastases (18 with melanoma, 34 with NSCLC), and  enrolled 36 (18 with melanoma, 18 with NSCLC). A brain metastasis response was achieved in four (22%; 95% CI 7-48) of 18 patients with melanoma and six (33%; 14-59) of 18 patients with NSCLC. Responses were durable, with all but one patient with NSCLC who responded showing an ongoing response at the time of data  analysis on June 30, 2015. Treatment-related serious and grade 3-4 adverse events were grade 3 elevated aminotransferases (n=1 [6%]) in the melanoma cohort, and grade 3 colitis (n=1 [6%]), grade 3 pneumonitis (n=1 [6%]), grade 3 fatigue (n=1  [6%]), grade 4 hyperkalemia (n=1 [6%]), and grade 2 acute kidney injury (n=1 [6%]) in the NSCLC cohort. Clinically significant neurological adverse events included transient grade 3 cognitive dysfunction and grade 1-2 seizures (n=3 [17%]) in the melanoma cohort. INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab shows activity in brain metastases in patients with melanoma or NSCLC with an acceptable safety profile, which suggests that there might be a role for systemic immunotherapy in patients with untreated or progressive brain metastases.

Previous therapies including dacarbazine and radiation of 39 Gy to the esophageal region were performed, but the liver metastases deteriorated. The patient was then administered nivolumab (2 mg/kg, every 3 weeks). After 3 cycles, the esophageal tumor and lymph nodes showed marked reductions in size, the lung metastases disappeared, and the liver metastases shrank partially. The treatment  continued with 7 cycles for 4 months. However, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia appeared in the 6th cycle, and intermittent blood transfusions were required. The patient received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy for bi-cytopenia, but it was ineffective. Seven months after the initiation of nivolumab, the patient died of tumor. Although the mechanisms of bi-cytopenia were unclear, it could have been induced by nivolumab. CONCLUSION: The present case shows a rare but serious life-threatening bi-cytopenia possibly associated with nivolumab and suggests the importance of awareness of hematological adverse events during nivolumab therapy."

This suggests that T cell responses in the lung, a vital organ continuously exposed to a variety of antigens, are strongly restrained by the PD-1 checkpoint. In turn, this could explain the association of PD-1 checkpoint inhibition with potentially fatal immune-mediated pneumonitis and partially also its efficacy in lung cancer."

However, despite initial tumor control, most patients suffer from locoregional relapse and/or metastatic disease following RT. The use of immunotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) could potentially change this outcome by enhancing the effects of RT. Here, we report significant (up to 70% volume reduction of the target lesion) and durable (up to 12 weeks) tumor regressions in conditional Kras-driven genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of NSCLC treated with radiotherapy and a programmed cell death 1 antibody (αPD-1). However, while αPD-1 therapy was beneficial when combined with RT in radiation-naive tumors, αPD-1 therapy had no antineoplastic efficacy in RT-relapsed tumors and further induced T cell inhibitory markers in this setting. Furthermore, there was differential efficacy of αPD-1 plus RT among Kras-driven GEMMs, with additional loss of the tumor suppressor serine/threonine kinase 11/liver kinase B1 (Stk11/Lkb1) resulting in no synergistic efficacy. Taken together, our data provide evidence for a close interaction among RT, T cells, and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and underscore the rationale for clinical combinatorial therapy with immune modulators and radiotherapy."

Among these, some malignant cancers such as oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumor are often recognized as clinical problems because, despite their high frequencies, current treatments for these cancers may not always achieve satisfying outcomes. The absence of effective systemic therapies against these cancers leads researchers to investigate novel therapeutic modalities, including  immunotherapy. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a costimulatory receptor with immunosuppressive function. When it binds its ligands, PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or PD-L2, PD-1 on T cells negatively regulates activating signals from the T cell receptor, resulting in the inhibition of the effector function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Aberrant PD-L1 expression has been reported in many human cancers and is considered an immune escape mechanism for cancers. In clinical trials, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced tumor regression for several malignancies, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In this study, to assess the potential of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a novel therapeutic target for canine cancer immunotherapy, immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression in various malignant cancers of  dogs was performed. Here, we show that dog oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumor, mammary adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma expressed PD-L1, whereas some other types of cancer did not. In addition, PD-1 was highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from oral melanoma, showing that lymphocytes in this cancer type might have been  functionally exhausted. These results strongly encourage the clinical application of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents against these cancers in dogs."

Sixty-eight pleural surgical specimens, including 58 MPM (epithelioid, n = 34; biphasic, n = 11; sarcomatoid, n = 13) and 10 benign lesions, were studied. PD-L1 expression was assessed using E1L3N and SP142 clones in tumor cells (TCs) and in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (positivity threshold of 1%), and compared  with overall survival. PD-1, CD3 and CD8 expression by TILs, and TLR3 expression  by TCs were analyzed concomitantly. PD-L1 was more expressed by sarcomatoid subtype than by other MPM (62% versus 23% and 9% for E1L3N; 38% versus 11% for SP142) (P = .01 and .04, respectively). Specificity and sensitivity of E1L3N and  SP142 were of 53% and 98%, and 90% and 86%, respectively. PD-L1 expression by TILs and TCs correlated for SP142 (P = .023), and PD-L1 SP142 expression by TCs was associated with shorter overall survival (P = .016). TLR3 was expressed in most MPM, but weakly in sarcomatoid MPM. We confirm by comparing two commercially available antibodies that PD-L1 expression is higher in sarcomatoid MPM and correlates with a shorter survival. Whereas TLR3 agonists could be tested in MPM  expressing TLR3, the sarcomatoid subtype could benefit from anti-PD-L1/PD-1 therapies alone or in combination."

Here we show that IFN-γ accounts for only ~30% of CD4 T cell-dependent cumulative bacterial control in the lungs over the first six weeks of infection,  but >80% of control in the spleen. Moreover, increasing the IFN-γ-producing capacity of CD4 T cells by ~2 fold exacerbates lung infection and leads to the early death of the host, despite enhancing control in the spleen. In addition, we show that the inhibitory receptor PD-1 facilitates host resistance to Mtb by preventing the detrimental over-production of IFN-γ by CD4 T cells. Specifically, PD-1 suppressed the parenchymal accumulation of and pathogenic IFN-γ production by the CXCR3+KLRG1-CX3CR1- subset of lung-homing CD4 T cells that otherwise mediates control of Mtb infection.

Checkpoint blockade antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programed cell-death protein 1 (PD-1) have demonstrated acceptable toxicity, promising clinical responses, durable disease control, and improved survival in some patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and other tumor types. About 20 % of advanced NSCLC patients and  30 % of advanced melanoma patients experience tumor responses from checkpoint blockade monotherapy, with better clinical responses seen with the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Given the power of these new therapies, it  is important to understand the complex and dynamic nature of host immune responses and the regulation of additional molecules in the tumor microenvironment and normal organs in response to the checkpoint blockade therapies. In this era of precision oncology, there remains a largely unmet need  to identify the patients who are most likely to benefit from immunotherapy, to optimize the monitoring assays for tumor-specific immune responses, to develop strategies to improve clinical efficacy, and to identify biomarkers so that immune-related adverse events can be avoided. At this time, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using 22C3 antibody is the only FDA-approved  companion diagnostic for patients with NSCLC-treated pembrolizumab, but more are  expected to come to market. We here summarize the current knowledge, clinical efficacy, potential immune biomarkers, and associated assays for immune checkpoint blockade therapies in advanced solid tumors."

A total of 379 NSCLC patients were enrolled. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 genes were selected and genotyped. The associations of SNPs with chemotherapy response and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Among the 12 SNPs investigated, PD-L1 rs2297136T > C and rs4143815C > G were significantly associated with clinical outcomes after chemotherapy. The rs2297136T > C was significantly associated with both better chemotherapy response and better OS, and the rs4143815C > G had a significantly better response to chemotherapy. Consistent with the individual genotype analyses, rs2297136C-rs4143815G haplotype (ht4) carrying variant alleles at both  loci was significantly associated with better chemotherapy response and OS compared with combined other haplotypes. Patients with at least one ht4 had significantly better chemotherapy response and OS compared to those without ht4.  PD-L1 rs2297136T > C and rs4143815C > G polymorphisms may be useful for the prediction of clinical outcome of 1(st) line paclitaxel-cisplatin chemotherapy in NSCLC.

We comprehensively analyzed the immunogenomic properties in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) according to the classification of tumor into four groups based on PD-L1 status and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte recruitment (TIL), a combination that has been suggested to be a theoretically reliable biomarker of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The RNA expression levels of PD-L1 and CD8A in the samples in the pan-cancer database of TCGA (N = 9,677) were analyzed. Based on their median values, the samples were classified into four tumor microenvironment immune types (TMIT). The mutational profiles, PD-L1 amplification, and viral association of the samples were compared according to the four TMITs. The proportions of TMIT I, defined by high PD-L1 and CD8A expression, were high in lung adenocarcinoma (67.1%) and kidney clear cell carcinoma (64.8%)  among solid cancers. The number of somatic mutations and the proportion of microsatellite instable-high tumor in TMIT I were significantly higher than those in other TMITs, respectively (P < 0.001). PD-L1 amplification and oncogenic virus infection were significantly associated with TMIT I, respectively (P < 0.001). A  multivariate analysis confirmed that the number of somatic mutations, PD-L1 amplification, and Epstein-Barr virus/human papillomavirus infection were independently associated with TMIT I. TMIT I is associated with a high mutational burden, PD-L1 amplification, and oncogenic viral infection. This integrative analysis highlights the importance of the assessment of both PD-L1 expression and TIL recruitment to predict responders to immune checkpoint inhibitors."

Approval was  based on demonstration of an improvement in overall survival (OS) in an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial comparing nivolumab to docetaxel in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The CheckMate 057 trial enrolled 582 patients  who were randomized (1:1) to receive nivolumab or docetaxel. Nivolumab demonstrated improved OS compared with docetaxel at the prespecified interim analysis with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.73 (p = .0015), and a median OS of 12.2 months (95% CI: 9.7-15.0 months) in patients treated with nivolumab compared with 9.4 months (95% CI: 8.0-10.7 months) in patients treated with docetaxel. A statistically significant improvement in objective response rate (ORR) was also observed, with an ORR of 19% (95% CI: 15%-24%) in the nivolumab arm and 12% (95%  CI: 9%-17%) in the docetaxel arm. The median duration of response was 17 months in the nivolumab arm and 6 months in the docetaxel arm. Progression-free survival was not statistically different between arms. A prespecified retrospective subgroup analysis suggested that patients with programmed cell death ligand 1-negative tumors treated with nivolumab had similar OS to those treated with docetaxel. The toxicity profile of nivolumab was consistent with the known immune-mediated adverse event profile except for 1 case of grade 5 limbic encephalitis, which led to a postmarketing requirement study to better characterize immune-mediated encephalitis.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Based on the results from the CheckMate 057 clinical trial, nivolumab represents a new treatment option for patients requiring second-line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The role of nivolumab in patients with sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) alterations is less clear. Until dedicated studies are performed to better characterize the role and sequence of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy, patients with EGFR or ALK alterations should have progressed on appropriate targeted therapy before initiating PD-1 inhibitor therapy. Some patients whose tumors lack programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression also appear to have durable responses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval to Dako's PD-L1 test, PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx, which the applicant claimed as a nonessential complementary diagnostic for nivolumab use."

Clinical trials targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown a tendency towards higher efficacy if expression of PD-L1 is relatively high, as evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of tumour samples. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is of crucial importance not only for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  but probably also for patients with small cell lung cancer. Nivolumab, an antibody targeting PD-1, has recently received FDA and EMA approval for NSCLC, regardless of the PDL1 expression status (for both tumour types in the USA and for only SCC in EU). However, the need for a biomarker that allows better selection of patients is essential, to improve treatment efficacy and to manage cost of these therapies. Assessment of PD-L1 expression through immunohistochemical staining is advocated by many as one such potential biomarker. This prospect raises several questions, in particular how to define a  threshold for positive PD-L1 labelling on biopsy tissue samples, taking into account that certain patients respond to treatment targeting PD-L1/PD-1, despite  low or absent immunoreactivity of this biomarker.

Antibodies that target programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) will block the ligand-receptor interface, thereby allowing T cells to attack the tumor and increase antitumor immune response. In clinical trials, PD-1 inhibitors have been associated with an approximately 20% overall response rate in unselected patients with non-small cell lung cancer, with sustained tumor response in a subset of patients treated by these immune checkpoint inhibitors. Facing a proliferation of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry clones, staining platforms, and scoring criteria, the pathologist must decide on the feasibility of introducing a newly approved companion diagnostic assay that may require purchase not only of a specific antibody kit but of a particular staining platform. Given the likely reality that clinical practice may, in the near future, demand access to 4 different PD-L1 antibodies coupled with different immunohistochemistry platforms, laboratories will be challenged with deciding among this variety of testing methods, each with its own potential benefits. Another immediate challenge to PD-L1 testing in lung  cancer patients is that of access to adequate tumor tissue, given that non-small  cell lung cancer samples are often extremely limited in size. With PD-L1 testing  it has become clear that the historically used US regulatory approach of one assay-one drug will not be sustainable. One evolving concept is that of complementary diagnostics, a novel regulatory pathway initiated by the US Food and Drug Administration, which is distinct from companion diagnostics in that it  may present additional flexibility. Although pathologists need to face the practical reality that oncologists will be asking regularly for the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry status of their patients' tumors, we should also keep in mind that there may be room for improvement of biomarkers for immunotherapy response. The field is rich with opportunities for investigation into biomarkers  of immunotherapy response, particularly in the form of collaborative, multidisciplinary studies that incorporate oncologists, pathologists, and basic scientists.

This treatment seems to be more effective when a high expression of PD-L1 is detected by immunohistochemistry in  bronchial biopsies.

This immunotherapy could be dependent to the  immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of PD-L1 expression, thus considered as a companion diagnostic test. This near perspective poses challenges with regard to  the positivity threshold value for PD-L1 expression before therapy administration, the positive cellular compartment (tumour cells and/or immune cells), the percentage of positive cells and the clone which is used. A couple of patients have a good response to treatment targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis despite  the absence or a weak PD-L1 expression. However the assessment of PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry will be the only mandatory approach before therapeutic strategies targeting the PD1/PD-L1 axis for lung cancer patients.

In this study, we have demonstrated that blocking CD96 with a monoclonal antibody inhibited experimental metastases in three different tumor models. The antimetastatic activity of anti-CD96 was dependent on NK cells, CD226 (DNAM-1), and IFNγ, but independent of activating Fc receptors. Anti-CD96 was more effective in combination with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or doxorubicin chemotherapy. Blocking CD96 in Tigit(-/-)mice significantly reduced experimental  and spontaneous metastases compared with its activity in wild-type mice. Co-blockade of CD96 and PD-1 potently inhibited lung metastases, with the combination increasing local NK-cell IFNγ production and infiltration. Overall, these data demonstrate that blocking CD96 is a new and complementary immunotherapeutic strategy to reduce tumor metastases.SIGNIFICANCE: This article  illustrates the antimetastatic activity and mechanism of action of an anti-CD96 antibody that inhibits the CD96-CD155 interaction and stimulates NK-cell function.

Pneumonitis has been recognized as a potentially life-threatening adverse event among NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors; however, the detailed clinical and radiographic manifestations of this entity remain to be described. We report on two cases of anti-PD-1 pneumonitis in advanced NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab after its FDA approval. Both patients presented with ground-glass and reticular opacities and consolidations in a peripheral distribution on CT, demonstrating a radiographic pattern of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Consolidations were extensive and rapidly developed within 8 weeks of therapy in both cases. Both patients were treated with corticosteroids with subsequent improvement of respiratory symptoms and radiographic findings. One patient experienced recurrent pneumonitis after completing corticosteroid taper, or a pneumonitis flare, in the absence of nivolumab retreatment, with subsequent improvement upon corticosteroid readministration. With the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in a growing number of tumor types, awareness of the radiographic and clinical manifestations of PD-1 inhibitor-related pneumonitis will be critical for the prompt diagnosis and management of this potentially serious adverse event."

Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, disrupts BCR signaling and leads to the egress of tumor cells from the microenvironment. Although the on-target effects on CLL cells are well defined, the impact on the microenvironment is less well studied. We therefore sought to characterize the in vivo effects of ibrutinib on the tumor microenvironment. Patients received single-agent ibrutinib on an investigator-initiated phase II trial. Serial blood and tissue samples were collected pretreatment and during treatment. Changes in cytokine levels, cellular subsets, and microenvironmental interactions were assessed. Serum levels of key chemokines and inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly in patients on ibrutinib. Furthermore, ibrutinib treatment decreased circulating tumor cells and overall T-cell numbers. Most notably, a reduced frequency of the Th17 subset of CD4(+)T cells was observed concurrent with reduced expression of activation markers and PD-1 on T cells. Consistent with direct inhibition of T cells, ibrutinib inhibited Th17 differentiation of murine CD4(+)T cells in vitro Finally, in the bone marrow microenvironment, we found that ibrutinib disaggregated the interactions of macrophages and CLL cells, inhibited secretion of CXCL13, and decreased the chemoattraction of CLL cells. In conjunction with inhibition of BCR signaling, these changes in the tumor microenvironment likely contribute to the antitumor activity of ibrutinib and may impact the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with CLL.

The present meta-analysis investigates whether the PD-L1 status, detected by immunohistochemistry, is associated with clinical response and mortality in patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. A systematic literature search and quantitative analysis were planned, conducted and reported following CONSORT and QUORUM checklists, up to December 2015, to identify clinical trials with information on cancer outcome by PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression in tumor tissues. We used random effects models to estimate Summary Objective Response Rates (SORRs) and Summary Odd Ratio (SOR) for the comparison of PD-L1 positive and negative patients. We summarized 20 trials carried out in metastatic melanoma (MM), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (4230 MM, 1417 NSCLC and 312 RCC patients).  Positive PD-L1 MM patients showed a significant decrease (53%) in the risk of mortality vs. negative cases with no heterogeneity. Furthermore, SORRs were 45% and 27% in PD-L1 positive and negative patients, respectively, and SOR indicates  a significant difference in term of responses: 2.14 (95% CI: 1.65, 2.77), with low between-study heterogeneity (I(2)=35%). Furthermore, results from randomized  clinical trials on MM showed that PD-L1 expression is significantly associated with greater clinical response rates to anti-PD1 treatments (SOR 1.89; 95%CI: 1.35, 2.64) but not to other treatments (SOR 0.96; 95%CI: 0.5, 1.87). In non-squamous NSCLC SORRs were 29% and 11% in PD-L1 positive and negative patients, respectively, and SOR indicates a significant difference between responses: 3.78 (1.54, 9.24), with no between-study heterogeneity. Squamous NSCLC and RCC did not show any significant difference in response according to the PD-L1 status. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression is significantly associated with mortality and clinical response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in MM patients and with clinical  response in patients with non-squamous NSCLC."

The development of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy as second-line therapy has reduced the role of EGFR TKIs in EGFR wild-type NSCLC. Recently, there has been increased recognition of the benefit of the earlier integration of palliative care and symptom management, and this is reasonable alternative to treatment with an EGFR  TKI for many patients. My practice pattern for patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC is platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy, immunotherapy as second-line therapy, and single-agent chemotherapy as third-line therapy for patients with preserved performance status who want to pursue further therapy. Only a small proportion of patients are eligible for fourth-line therapy, and I prefer to enroll them in clinical trials rather than use EGFR TKIs. I suspect that the use of EGFR TKIs in clinical use and as a comparator arm for clinical trials will continue to decline over the next several years."

However, robust and reliable experimental models to test immunotherapeutic combinations in squamous lung tumors are still lacking. We generated a transplantable squamous cell carcinoma cell line (UN-SCC680AJ) from a lung tumor induced by chronic N-nitroso-tris-chloroethylurea mutagenesis in A/J mice. Tumor cells expressed cytokeratins, overexpressed p40, and lacked thyroid transcription factor 1, confirming the squamous lineage reported by histological analysis. More than 200 mutations found in its exome suggested potential for antigenicity. Immunocompetent mice subcutaneously implanted with this syngeneic cell line were treated with anti-CD137 and/or anti-PD-1 mAbs and monitored for tumor growth/progression or assessed for intratumoral leukocyte infiltration using immunohistochemical analysis and flow cytometry. In syngeneic mice, large 12-day-established tumors derived from the transplantable cell line variant UN-SCC680AJ were amenable to curative treatment  with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CD137 immunostimulatory mAbs. Single-agent therapies lost curative efficacy when treatment was started beyond day +17, whereas a combination of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CD137 achieved complete rejections.  Tumor cells expressed weak baseline PD-L1 on the plasma membrane, but this could  be readily induced by interferon-γ. Combined treatment efficacy required CD8 T cells and induced a leukocyte infiltrate in which T lymphocytes co-expressing CD137 and PD-1 were prominent. These promising results advocate the use of combined anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-CD137 mAb immunotherapy for the treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer in the clinical setting."

One explanation for this effect is that hypermutated lesions harbor more tumor-specific neoantigens that stimulate recruitment of an increased number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which is counterbalanced by overexpression of immune checkpoints such as PD-1 or PD-L1. Given that BRCA1/2-mutated high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) exhibit a higher mutational load and a unique mutational signature with an elevated number of larger indels up to 50 bp, we hypothesized that they may also harbor more tumor-specific neoantigens, and, therefore, exhibit increased TILs and PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Here, we report significantly higher predicted neoantigens in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors compared to tumors without alterations in homologous recombination (HR) genes (HR-proficient tumors). Tumors with higher neoantigen load were associated with improved overall survival and higher expression of immune genes associated with tumor cytotoxicity such as genes of the TCR, the IFN-gamma and the TNFR pathways. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that BRCA1/2-mutated tumors exhibited significantly increased CD3+ and CD8+ TILs, as well as elevated expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumor-associated immune cells compared to HR-proficient tumors. Survival analysis showed that both BRCA1/2-mutation status and number of TILs were independently associated with outcome. Of note, two distinct groups of HGSOCs, one with very poor prognosis (HR proficient with low number of TILs) and one with very good prognosis (BRCA1/2-mutated tumors with high number of TILs) were defined. These findings support a link between BRCA1/2-mutation status, immunogenicity and survival, and suggesting that BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOCs may be more sensitive to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors compared to HR-proficient HGSOCs."

Here, we analyzed PD-L1 expression in 436 genetically annotated NSCLC specimens enriched for early stages using PD-L1 antibody 5H1. Expression of PD-L1 was detected in the tumor cells (TC) (34% of cases) and in associated immune cells (IC) (49%) across all stages of NSCLC, either alone or in combination. PD-L1 IHC-positive TC, but not IC showed significantly higher PD-L1 RNA expression levels. Expression in TC was associated with TP53, KRAS and STK11 mutational status in adenocarcinomas (AD) and with NFE2L2 mutations in squamous cell carcinomas (SQ).  No correlations with histological subtype, clinical characteristics and overall survival were found. The presence of PD-L1-positive IC was significantly associated with patients' smoking status in AD. The findings are in agreement with the emerging concept that tumors with high mutational burden are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy, since TP53 and KRAS mutations are linked to smoking, increased numbers of somatic mutations and expression of neoantigens.

We report a comprehensive  analysis of systemic irAE pathology based on the autopsy of a 35-year-old female  patient with metastatic melanoma treated first with ipilimumab and then nivolumab.

Upon light irradiation, PDT by DSAB-HK significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous 4T1 tumors, and in addition promoted the maturation of dendritic cells and their production of cytokines, which subsequently stimulated the tumor recruitment of CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Furthermore, DSAB-HK PDT of the first tumor followed by  PD-1 blockade markedly suppressed the growth of a second subcutaneous tumor, and  also slowed the growth of 4T1-fLuc lung metastasis as demonstrated by serial bioluminescence imaging.

One such mechanism is the adoption of immune checkpoints to inhibit the host immune response. Immune checkpoint inhibitors show great promise in the  treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. To discuss the possibility of biomarker selection of patients for these therapies. This is becoming a much debated issue, and the immunohistochemical detection of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1), the ligand for the inhibitory Programmed Death receptor 1 (PD-1) checkpoint, is one possible biomarker. Data so far available show some conflicting results, but PD-L1 immunohistochemistry looks likely to be introduced into clinical use for selecting patients for treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapies. Given that there are 4 such drugs rapidly approaching regulatory approval, each with its own independent PD-L1 immunohistochemistry biomarker test, both oncologists and pathologists face some significant challenges. Peer-reviewed literature and meeting proceedings, especially during the last 12 months, were used. The biology of PD-1/PD-L1 is complex, the clinical data for these drugs show considerable variation, the selection performance of the PD-L1 biomarker test is not perfect, and the existence of 4 drug/test combinations adds significantly to the problems faced.

Many oncogenes promote immune escape, undermining the effectiveness of immunotherapies, but it is unclear whether the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, such as STK11/LKB1, exerts similar effects. In this study, we investigated the consequences of STK11/LKB1 loss on the immune microenvironment in a mouse model of KRAS-driven NSCLC. Genetic ablation of STK11/LKB1 resulted in accumulation of neutrophils with T-cell-suppressive effects, along with a corresponding increase in the expression of T-cell exhaustion markers and tumor-promoting cytokines. The number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was also  reduced in LKB1-deficient mouse and human tumors. Furthermore, STK11/LKB1-inactivating mutations were associated with reduced expression of PD-1 ligand PD-L1 in mouse and patient tumors as well as in tumor-derived cell lines.  Consistent with these results, PD-1-targeting antibodies were ineffective against Lkb1-deficient tumors. In contrast, treating Lkb1-deficient mice with an IL6-neutralizing antibody or a neutrophil-depleting antibody yielded therapeutic  benefits associated with reduced neutrophil accumulation and proinflammatory cytokine expression. Our findings illustrate how tumor suppressor mutations can modulate the immune milieu of the tumor microenvironment, and they offer specific implications for addressing STK11/LKB1-mutated tumors with PD-1-targeting antibody therapies."

Use of these agents holds promise in other malignancies. The augmented immune response enabled by these agents has led to a particular group of side effects called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The main irAEs include diarrhea, colitis, hepatitis, skin toxicities and endocrinopathies such as hypophysitis and thyroid dysfunction. The anti-PD-1 antibodies have a different toxicity profile to ipilimumab with fewer high grade events. This article identifies the rates of common and uncommon irAEs associated with each immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) and their timing of onset, focusing mainly on the experience in melanoma and lung cancer. An approach to management for each class of irAE is provided."

The use of predictive biomarkers for identifying patients suitable for these therapies is an important issue not only for making treatment decisions, but also from a medical economic point of view. RECENT FINDINGS: Among potential predictive biomarker candidates for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments in nonsmall cell lung cancer, the expression of PD-L1  (as determined by immunohistochemistry) is currently the most studied. PD-L1 positivity has been associated with higher response rate to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. However, several observations suggest that the predictive value of PD-L1 expression is not clear-cut. We review other potential predictive biomarkers, including programmed death-ligand 2, IFN-γ, and genetic signatures. Standardized techniques and conditions for evaluating PD-L1 expression (tissue quality and age, percentage positivity threshold, managing heterogeneous  and dynamic expression) are critical for establishing the use of this protein as  a predictive marker. Care should be also taken when using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies in combination with other therapies, which may impact the predictive value of PD-L1 expression."

In the USA, ≈60 % of lung cancer cases are diagnosed in elderly patients (≥65 years of age). However, elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical studies, leading to a paucity of evidence to guide treatment decisions.  Several treatment barriers exist in elderly patients, including comorbidities and poor performance status. In addition, lack of reliable geriatric assessment tools and physician reluctance to treat may contribute to undertreatment in this population. For decades, systemic chemotherapy for elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was either omitted or given as monotherapy, frequently with significant dose reductions, potentially compromising the efficacy of these therapies. Recent analyses of elderly subgroups from multiple clinical trials provide evidence for improved outcomes associated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapies vs monotherapy. Moreover, in the new era of precision medicine, molecularly targeted therapies and more recently immune-targeting therapies (anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents) exhibit relatively milder toxicities but superior clinical outcomes in subgroups of patients compared with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies. Further clinical trials will be needed to confirm similar safety and efficacy profiles of these therapeutic approaches in the elderly compared with their younger counterparts. In this article, we review available evidence from clinical studies and also present expert consensus on the management of NSCLC in the elderly, including treatment in the adjuvant setting and treatment of advanced disease. Screening tools, such  as the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, that help to identify the right population of elderly patients suitable for systemic treatment are also discussed."

Accordingly, in recent years, the enthusiasm for research of cancer immunology has shifted to studies regarding the formation of the immune suppressive environment, immune suppression mechanisms in cancer tissues and the molecules and cells involved in these pathways. Novel findings from these studies might lead to the development of cancer immunotherapy based on control of the immune suppressive environment."

Identifying immune biomarkers could guide patient selection and optimisation of EGFR-TKI-immunotherapy combinations. 33 patients with NSCLC treated with an EGFR-TKI were prospectively enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected pre-treatment, and after 1, 3 and 8 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to identify immune cell subsets, including PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing T cells. Immune parameters were correlated with clinical outcomes. Compared to healthy donors (n=10), patients had higher pre-treatment proportions of proliferating and PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells (p<0.001). Compared to patients with an EGFR mutation (n=12), patients without a known mutation (n=21) had higher proportions of proliferating CD4(+) and PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells (p=0.03). There was a significant increase in PD-L1(+) T cells after 1 week of EGFR-TKI in patients whose disease progressed compared to non-progressors. Patients with higher PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells at 1-week were more likely to progress (OR 30.3, p<0.01) and had shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 8.8m; p<0.01) and OS (3.8 vs 23.2m; p<0.001) than those with fewer PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells. On multivariate  analysis, high PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells was the only independent predictor for PFS  (HR 3.7, p=0.01), while for OS independent predictors were high PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T  cells (HR 6.5, p<0.01) and EGFR-negative status (HR 3.3, p=0.04). There was a significant correlation between PD-L1 expression on peripheral T cells and clinical outcomes in EGFR-TKI-treated NSCLC.

Radiolabeled [111In]PD-L1-mAb and near-infrared dye conjugated NIR-PD-L1-mAb imaging agents were developed using the mouse and human cross-reactive PD-L1 antibody MPDL3280A. We tested specificity of [111In]PD-L1-mAb and NIR-PD-L1-mAb in cell lines and in tumors with varying levels of PD-L1 expression. We performed SPECT/CT imaging, biodistribution and blocking studies in NSG mice bearing tumors with constitutive PD-L1 expression (CHO-PDL1) and in controls (CHO). Results were confirmed in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (MDAMB231 and SUM149) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (H2444 and H1155) xenografts with varying levels of PD-L1 expression. There was specific binding of [111In]PD-L1-mAb and NIR-PD-L1-mAb to tumor cells in vitro, correlating with PD-L1 expression levels.  In mice bearing subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors, there was specific and persistent high accumulation of signal intensity in PD-L1 positive tumors (CHO-PDL1, MDAMB231, H2444) but not in controls. These results demonstrate that [111In]PD-L1-mAb and NIR-PD-L1-mAb can detect graded levels of PD-L1 expression in human tumor xenografts in vivo. As a humanized antibody, these findings suggest clinical translation of radiolabeled versions of MPDL3280A for imaging.

Nivolumab is also approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. In patients with melanoma, these agents result in objective response rates of ~25-40%, with durable responses lasting more than 2 years in some cases.

In tumours progressing following response to anti-PD-1 therapy, we observe upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints, notably T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), in PD-1 antibody bound T cells and demonstrate a survival advantage with addition of a TIM-3 blocking antibody following failure of PD-1 blockade. Two patients who developed adaptive resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment also show a similar TIM-3 upregulation in blocking antibody-bound T cells at treatment failure.

Given the contribution of tumor microenvironments to EMT, we extended our investigation of EMT to patient tumors  from 11 cancer types to develop a pan-cancer EMT signature. Using the pan-cancer EMT signature, we conducted an integrated, global analysis of genomic and proteomic profiles associated with EMT across 1,934 tumors including breast, lung, colon, ovarian, and bladder cancers.  Differences in outcome and in vitro drug response corresponding to expression of  the pan-cancer EMT signature were also investigated. Compared with the lung cancer EMT signature, the patient-derived, pan-cancer EMT signature encompasses a set of core EMT genes that correlate even  more strongly with known EMT markers across diverse tumor types and identifies differences in drug sensitivity and global molecular alterations at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Among those changes associated with EMT, pathway analysis revealed a strong correlation between EMT and immune activation. Further supervised analysis demonstrated high expression of immune checkpoints and other  druggable immune targets, such as PD1, PD-L1, CTLA4, OX40L, and PD-L2, in tumors  with the most mesenchymal EMT scores. Elevated PD-L1 protein expression in mesenchymal tumors was confirmed by IHC in an independent lung cancer cohort. This new signature provides a novel, patient-based, histology-independent tool for the investigation of EMT and offers insights into  potential novel therapeutic targets for mesenchymal tumors, independent of cancer type, including immune checkpoints."

Targeting these checkpoints in patients living with cancer  had led to long-lasting tumour responses.

Major goals of almost all clinical trials based on histology and molecular markers for NSCLC patients are improvements of OS and QoL.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health authorities  have recommended to consider OS to be the standard clinical benefit endpoint that should be used to establish the efficacy of a treatment for NSCLC patients, however, the question remains what is clinically meaningful and how can this outcome be measured. According to suggestions of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Cancer Research Committee a relative improvement in median OS of  at least 20% (3-4 months) is regarded to define a clinically meaningful improvement in outcome of NSCLC patients. However, this should not diminish PFS as a valid endpoint since a PFS improvement can also result in a meaningful palliation (e.g., painful bone metastases). Other factors (e.g., QoL) may also be involved to measure and to define the clinical importance of a given trial result.

Twenty-five percent of patients had PD-L1 strong-positive tumors, and 50% had PD-L1 weak-positive tumors. No statistically significant association was  found between PD-L1 expression and survival; adjusted hazard ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.03; median OS, 9.0 months) for the PD-L1 strong-positive group and 1.07 (0.74-1.55; median OS, 9.8 months) for the PD-L1 weak-positive group compared with the PD-L1-negative group (median OS, 7.5 months). No association was seen between PD-L1 expression and OS when PD-L1 expression levels were stratified by median or tertiles. In concordance with previous studies, we found PD-L1 measured by immunohistochemistry to be frequently expressed in patients with advanced NSCLC.  However, PD-L1 expression is not a strong prognostic marker in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with chemotherapy."

In human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, membranous expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with mTOR activation. These data suggest that oncogenic activation of the AKT-mTOR pathway  promotes immune escape by driving expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer where an mTOR inhibitor combined with a PD-1 antibody decreased tumor growth, increased tumor-infiltrating T cells, and decreased regulatory T cells."

We transduced human T cells with a published, optimized T-cell receptor (TCR) that is directed to a peptide within the cancer testis antigen, NY-ESO-1. After demonstrating antigen-specific in vitro activity, these  cells were used to target a human lung cancer line that expressed NY-ESO-1 in the appropriate HLA context growing in immunodeficient mice. The ability of anti-PD1  antibody to augment efficacy was tested. Injection of transgenic T cells had some antitumor activity, but did not eliminate the tumors. The injected T cells became profoundly hypofunctional accompanied by upregulation of PD1, Tim3, and Lag3 with coexpression of multiple  inhibitory receptors in a high percentage of cells. This model allowed us to test reagents targeted specifically to human T cells. We found that injections of an anti-PD1 antibody in combination with T cells led to decreased TIL hypofunction and augmented the efficacy of the adoptively transferred T cells. This model offers a platform for preclinical testing of adjuvant immunotherapeutics targeted to human T cells prior to transition to the bedside.  Because the model employs engineering of human T cells with a TCR clone instead of a CAR, it allows for study of the biology of tumor-reactive TILs that signal through an endogenous TCR. The lessons learned from TCR-engineered TILs can thus  be applied to tumor-reactive TILs."

Such an oligonucleotide, AZD9150, exerts antineoplastic effects on a selected panel of STAT3-dependent human cancer cells growing in vitro and in vivo (as xenografts in immunodeficient mice). Moreover, preliminary data from a Phase I clinical trial indicate that AZD9150 may cause partial tumor regression in patients with chemorefractory lymphoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma. STAT3 not only participates in cell-autonomous processes that are required for the survival and growth of malignant cells, but also limits their ability to elicit anticancer immune responses. Moreover, STAT3 contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Thus, the inhibition of STAT3 may promote immunosurveillance by a dual mechanism: (1) it may increase the immunogenicity of cancer cells via cell-autonomous pathways; and (2) it may favor the reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment toward an immunostimulatory state. It will therefore be important to explore whether immunological biomarkers predict the efficacy of AZD9150 in the clinic. This may ameliorate patient stratification and it may pave the way for rational combination therapies involving classical chemotherapeutics with immunostimulatory effects, AZD9150 and immunotherapeutic agents such as checkpoint blockers."

Despite robust responses to initial chemotherapy and radiation,  the prognosis of patients with SCLC remains poor with an overall 5-year survival  rate of less than 10 %. Despite the fact that numerous molecularly targeted approaches have thus far failed to demonstrate clinical utility in SCLC, further  advances will rely on better definition of the biological pathways that drive survival, proliferation and metastasis. Recent next-generation, molecular profiling studies have identified many new therapeutic targets in SCLC, as well as extreme genomic instability which explains the high degree of resistance. A wide variety of anti-angiogenic agents, growth factor inhibitors, pro-apoptotic agents, and epigenetic modulators have been evaluated in SCLC and many studies of these strategies are on-going. Perhaps the most promising approaches involve agents targeting cancer stem cell pathways and immunomodulatory drugs that interfere with the PD1 and CTLA-4 pathways. SCLC offers many barriers to the development of successful therapy, including limited tumor samples, inadequate preclinical models, high mutational burden, and aggressive tumor growth which impairs functional status and hampers enrollment on clinical trials."

We now know that anti-PD-1/PD-L1 has substantial clinical activity in both of these diseases, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 15%-20%. These responses are frequently rapid and durable, increase median overall survival (OS) compared  with chemotherapy, and produce long-term survivors. Despite these very significant results, many patients do not benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1. This is because of the potential for malignancies to co-opt myriad immunosuppressive mechanisms other than aberrant expression of PD-L1. Conceptually, these can be divided into three categories. First, for some patients there is likely a failure to generate sufficient functional tumor antigen-specific T cells. Second, for others, tumor antigen-specific T cells may be generated but fail to enter into the tumor parenchyma. Finally, there are a large number of immunosuppressive mechanisms that have the potential to be operational within the tumor microenvironment: surface membrane immune checkpoint proteins PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG3, TIM3, BTLA, and adenosine A2AR; soluble factors and metabolic alterations interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, adenosine, IDO, and arginase; and inhibitory cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), regulatory  T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages. In this article, we discuss three strategies to generate more tumor-reactive T cells for patients: anti-CTLA-4, therapeutic tumor vaccination,  and adoptive cellular therapy, with T cells redirected to tumor antigens using T-cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene modification. We also review some of the various strategies in development to thwart tumor microenvironment immunosuppressive mechanisms. Strategies to drive more T cells into tumors remain a significant challenge."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CLTA-4 antibodies and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) potentiate the host's own antitumor immune response.  These immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown impressive clinical efficacy in advanced melanoma, metastatic kidney cancer, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-all malignancies that frequently cause brain metastases. The immune response in the brain is highly regulated, challenging the treatment of brain metastases with immune-modulatory therapies. The immune microenvironment in brain metastases is active with a high density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes  in certain patients and, therefore, may serve as a potential treatment target. However, clinical data of the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in brain metastases compared with extracranial metastases are limited, as most clinical trials with these new agents excluded patients with active brain metastases. In this article, we review the current scientific evidence of brain metastases biology with specific emphasis on inflammatory tumor microenvironment and the evolving state of clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with brain metastases."

The PD-L1 antibodies showed poor concordance (Cohen κ range, 0.124-0.340) using conventional chromogenic IHC and showed intra-assay heterogeneity (E1L3N coefficient of variation [CV], 6.75%-75.24%; SP142 CV, 12.17%-109.61%) and significant interassay discordance using QIF (26.6%). Quantitative immunofluorescence showed that PD-L1 expression using both PD-L1 antibodies was heterogeneous. Using QIF, the scores obtained with E1L3N and SP142 for each tumor were significantly different according to nonparametric paired test (P < .001). Assessment of 588 serial section fields of view from whole tissue showed discordant expression at a frequency of 25%. Expression of PD-L1 was correlated with high TILs using both E1L3N (P = .007) and SP142 (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Objective determination of PD-L1 protein levels in NSCLC reveals heterogeneity within tumors and prominent interassay variability or discordance. This could be due to different antibody affinities, limited specificity, or distinct target epitopes. Efforts to determine the clinical value of these observations are under way."

The recent approval of ICI targeting CTLA-4 or PD-1 for the treatment  of cancer constitutes a major breakthrough in the field of oncology and demonstrates the potential of immune-mediated therapies in achieving durable cancer remissions. The identification of new immune regulatory pathways that could be targeted to reactivate or boost antitumor immunity is now a very active  field of research. In this context, the use of syngeneic mouse models and immune  monitoring techniques are the cornerstone of proof-of-concept studies. In this chapter, we describe the general methodology to evaluate antitumor activity of ICI in immunocompetent mice. We outline protocols to reliably establish tumors in mice and generate lung metastasis through tail vein injections with the aim of testing the efficacy of ICI. We also present methods to analyze the composition of the tumor immune-infiltrate by multicolor flow cytometry."

In some patients long-term remissions are seen. However, enhancement of  the immune response can be accompanied by immune-related adverse events (irAEs).  These patients often present with nonspecific symptoms. The most common irAEs are dermatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis and endocrinopathies. IrAEs can occur in every organ, even simultaneously. Furthermore, irAEs can occur weeks or months after discontinuation of checkpoint inhibitors. Most irAEs can be well managed, but life-threatening situations do occur. General management involves supportive  care, glucocorticoids and sometimes immunomodulatory drugs, such as infliximab. Early diagnosis and adequate team management can improve the course of irAEs without compromising the cancer treatment. Here, we present two cases: a melanoma patient with an ipilimumab-induced colitis and a lung cancer patient with pneumonitis after anti-PD-1.We then summarise the most common toxicities of checkpoint inhibitors, emphasising the need to familiarise the practitioner with  irAEs of approved and emerging immunotherapies."

We therefore analyzed the expression of PD-L1 on 293 well-documented NSCLC cases and correlated the results with clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics. The expression of PD-L1 on NSCLC was a poor prognostic factor for patients with nodal-negative adenocarcinoma (ACA) and, independent of other covariates, in tumors with increased CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  Expression of PD-L1 was more commonly seen in ACA and in male patients with a past and current smoking history. Finally, PD-L1+ TILs were more often found in squamous and large cell carcinomas. Should the expression of PD-L1 be on the verge of becoming an additional biomarker for routine diagnostics in NSCLC, our findings will provide  important further insight and could contribute towards more effectively stratifying patients.

However, how PD-L1 expression and immune function was affected by ALK-TKIs and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in ALK positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poorly understood. In the present study, western-blot, real-time  PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were employed to explore how PD-L1 was regulated by ALK fusion protein. ALK-TKIs and relevant inhibitors were used to identify the downstream signaling pathways involved in PD-L1 regulation. Cell apoptosis, viability and Elisa test were used to study the immune suppression by  ALK activation and immune reactivation by ALK-TKIs and/or PD-1 blocking in tumor  cells and DC-CIK cells co-culture system. We found that PD-L1 expression was associated with EGFR mutations and ALK fusion genes in NSCLC cell lines. Over-expression of ALK fusion protein increased PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 mediated  by ALK fusion protein increased the apoptosis of T cells in tumor cells and DC-CIK cells co-culture system. Inhibiting ALK by sensitive TKIs could enhance the production of IFNγ. Anti-PD-1 antibody was effective in both crizotinib sensitive and resistant NSCLC cells. Synergistic tumor killing effects were not observed with ALK-TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibody combination in co-culture system. ALK-TKIs not only directly inhibited tumor viability but also indirectly enhanced the antitumor immunity via the downregulation of PD-L1. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies could be an optional therapy for crizotinib sensitive, especially crizotinib resistant NSCLC patients with ALK fusion gene.

Most mAbs to PD-L1 in use are directed to its extracellular domain and immunohistochemically stain tumor tissue with a mixture of cytoplasmic and membrane staining. Cytoplasmic staining obscures the interpretation of a positive reaction on the tumor cell membrane, and thus affects the accuracy of PD-L1 scoring systems. We developed a mAb to the cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, 405.9A11  (9A11), which is both more selective for membranous PD-L1 and more sensitive in IHC and Western blotting, compared with previous mAbs specific for the PD-L1 extracellular domain. Here, we compare immunohistochemical staining patterns of PD-L1 expression in five types of tumors, using five PD-L1 mAbs: 9A11, 7G11, and  three commercially available mAbs.

Beyond direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, HDAC inhibitors  have also been shown to alter the immunogenicity and enhance antitumor immune responses. Here, we show that class I HDAC inhibitors upregulated the expression  of PD-L1 and, to a lesser degree, PD-L2 in melanomas. Evaluation of human and murine cell lines and patient tumors treated with a variety of HDAC inhibitors in vitro displayed upregulation of these ligands. This upregulation was robust and durable, with enhanced expression lasting past 96 hours. These results were validated in vivo in a B16F10 syngeneic murine model. Mechanistically, HDAC inhibitor treatment resulted in rapid upregulation of histone acetylation of the  PD-L1 gene leading to enhanced and durable gene expression. The efficacy of combining HDAC inhibition with PD-1 blockade for treatment of melanoma was also explored in a murine B16F10 model. Mice receiving combination therapy had a slower tumor progression and increased survival compared with control and single-agent treatments.

In this study, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the diversity and expression patterns of inhibitory receptors on tumor-infiltrating T cells from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In spite of the large heterogeneity observed in the amount of PD-1, Tim-3, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and BTLA expressed on intratumoral CD8(+) T cells from 32 patients, a clear correlation was established between increased expression of these inhibitory coreceptors and progression of the disease. Notably, the latter was accompanied by a progressively impaired capacity of T cells to respond to polyclonal activation. Coexpression of several inhibitory receptors was gradually acquired, with early PD-1 and late LAG-3/BTLA expression. PD-1 blockade was able to restore T-cell function only in a subset of patients. A high percentage of PD-1(hi) T cells was correlated with poor restoration of T-cell function upon PD-1 blockade. Of note, PD-1(hi) expression marked a particularly dysfunctional T-cell subset characterized by coexpression of multiple inhibitory receptors and thus may assist in identifying patients likely  to respond to inhibitory receptor-specific antibodies. Overall, these data may provide a framework for future personalized T-cell-based therapies aiming at restoration of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte effector functions."

We reviewed the clinical efficacy and safety of each compound based  upon major registered clinical trials and published clinical data. Overall, response rate of more than 20% is consistently seen across all these trials, with maximal response of approximately 50% achieved by certain single antiprogrammed death-1 agents or when used in combination with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4  blockade. The responses seen are early, durable, and have continued after treatment discontinuation. Immune-related adverse events are the most common side effects seen in these clinical trials. Overall, the skin and gastrointestinal tract are the most common organ systems affected by these compounds while hepatic, endocrine, and neurologic events are less frequent. These side effects are low grade, manageable, and typically resolve within a relatively short time frame with a predictable resolution pattern given proper management. We therefore propose detailed guidelines for management of major immune-related adverse events that are anticipated with antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapies based on general experience with other monoclonal antibodies and the established management algorithms for immune-related adverse events for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade with ipilimumab.

However, durable clinical response has been educed only in a fraction of patients, underlining the need to predictively  select those patients most likely to respond, e.g., by detecting predictive biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) detection of PD-L1 in tumor cells has been used in various trials of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents to try to select those patients  most likely to respond. However, since there are different techniques and scoring systems, results have not been conclusive. Thus efforts are needed to develop standardized IHC assays as well as to explore additional biomarkers to evaluate and predict immune responses elicited by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors target molecular pathways involved in immunosuppression, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway, with the goal to enhance the host's own immune anticancer response.

Identification of predictive biomarkers to select patients for immune therapies is currently being  investigated to improve their therapeutic efficacy. Transforming growth factor-β  (TGF-β), a pleiotropic cytokine with immunosuppressive effects on multiple cell types of the innate and adaptive immune system, has emerged as one of the potential key factors modulating response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

They work by activating T cells to combat tumors. This review is based on publications on recently approved T-cell-activating drugs that were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed. Randomized, controlled trials of checkpoint inhibitors, i.e., inhibitory antibodies for use against tumors, have shown that the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor ipilimumab can prolong the survival of  patients with advanced melanoma by 2 to 4 months. No data on median overall survival are yet available for the two programmed-death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors pembrolizumab und nivolumab; the endpoint tumor response was achieved in 24% and 32% of patients receiving these drugs, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects occurred in 50% of patients receiving ipilimumab and in 12 to 13% of those taking either of the two PD-1-inhibitors. Nivolumab prolonged the median survival of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer from 6 to 9 months. In refractory or recurrent Philadelphia-chromosome-negative pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B-ALL), treatment with the bispecific antibody construct blinatumomab led to complete remission in 43% of the patients, while grade 3, 4 or 5 toxicities occurred in 83%. CONCLUSION: T-cell-directed strategies have been established as a new pillar of treatment in medical oncology. As these drugs have frequent and severe adverse effects, therapeutic decision-making will have to take account not only of the predicted prolongation of survival, but also of the potential for an impaired quality of life while the patient is under treatment."

Here, we show that PDL1 is regulated by p53 via  miR-34. p53 wild-type and p53-deficient cell lines (p53(-/-) and p53(+/+) HCT116, p53-inducible H1299, and p53-knockdown H460) were used to determine if p53 regulates PDL1 via miR-34. PDL1 and miR-34a expression were analyzed in samples from patients with NSCLC and mutated p53 vs wild-type p53 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas for Lung Adenocarcinoma (TCGA LUAD). We confirmed that PDL1 is a direct target of miR-34 with western blotting and luciferase assays and used a p53(R172HΔ)g/+K-ras(LA1/+) syngeneic mouse model (n = 12) to deliver miR-34a-loaded liposomes (MRX34) plus radiotherapy (XRT) and assessed PDL1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A two-sided t test was applied to compare the mean between different treatments. We found that p53 regulates PDL1 via miR-34, which directly binds to the PDL1 3' untranslated region in models of NSCLC (fold-change luciferase activity to control group, mean for miR-34a = 0.50, SD = 0.2, P < .001; mean for miR-34b = 0.52, SD = 0.2, P = .006; and mean for miR-34c = 0.59, SD = 0.14, and P = .006).  Therapeutic delivery of MRX34, currently the subject of a phase I clinical trial, promoted TILs (mean of CD8 expression percentage of control group = 22.5%, SD = 1.9%; mean of CD8 expression percentage of MRX34 = 30.1%, SD = 3.7%, P = .016, n  = 4) and reduced CD8(+)PD1(+) cells in vivo (mean of CD8/PD1 expression percentage of control group = 40.2%, SD = 6.2%; mean of CD8/PD1 expression percentage of MRX34 = 20.3%, SD = 5.1%, P = .001, n = 4). Further, MRX34 plus XRT increased CD8(+) cell numbers more than either therapy alone (mean of CD8 expression percentage of MRX34 plus XRT to control group = 44.2%, SD = 8.7%, P =  .004, n = 4). Finally, miR-34a delivery reduced the numbers of radiation-induced  macrophages (mean of F4-80 expression percentage of control group = 52.4%, SD = 1.7%; mean of F4-80 expression percentage of MRX34 = 40.1%, SD = 3.5%, P = .008,  n = 4) and T-regulatory cells.

The PD-L1 polymorphism and the level of  soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) were investigated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 288 NSCLC patients and 300 controls were enrolled. An A/C polymorphism at position 8923 in the PD-L1 gene was genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The prevalence of the 8923C allele was significantly higher in NSCLC patients than controls (10.2% versus 5.3%, p = 0.002, odds ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval 1.30-3.17; data were adjusted for age and sex). NSCLC patients also showed increased plasma levels of sPD-L1 compared to controls (1.92 ng/mL versus 0.91 ng/mL, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, lung adenocarcinoma patients had higher sPD-L1 levels than patients with squamous cell carcinoma (p&lt;0.01).

Nivolumab is a novel programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor indicated as a second-line treatment for patients with NSCLC whose tumors exhibit squamous cell histology. Nivolumab has high affinity for the PD-1  receptor, and durable responses to treatment have been reported in clinical trials. In a Phase II study evaluating the drug's safety and efficacy in patients who had disease progression despite treatment with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and at least one additional systemic therapy, nivolumab-treated patients had an objective response rate of 14.5%, with a 17% rate of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events; overall survival at one year was 40.8%. A head-to-head comparison of docetaxel and nivolumab for second-line treatment of squamous cell NSCLC demonstrated superior overall survival and reduced grade 3 or 4 adverse effects in nivolumab-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab is a novel PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that is effective for treating advanced squamous NSCLC in patients previously treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy or alternative first-line agents. Based  on its improved efficacy and lower toxicity relative to docetaxel, nivolumab should be considered standard second-line therapy for this population."

Chronic inflammation is the hallmark of COPD, involving the interplay of a wide variety of cells in the lung microenvironment. Cigarette smoke (CS) induces chronic lung inflammation and is considered a key etiological factor in the development and pathogenesis of COPD. Structural and inflammatory cells in the lung respond to CS exposure by releasing proinflammatory mediators that recruit additional inflammatory immune cells, which collectively contribute to the establishment of a chronic inflammatory microenvironment. Chronic inflammation contributes to lung damage, compromises innate and adaptive immune responses, and facilitates the recurrent episodes of respiratory infection that punctuate and further contribute to the pathological manifestations of the stable disease. A number of studies support the conclusion that immune dysfunction leads to exacerbations and disease severity in COPD. Our group has clearly demonstrated that CS exacerbates lung inflammation and compromises immunity to respiratory pathogens in a mouse model of COPD. We have also investigated the phenotype of immune cells in patients with COPD compared with healthy control subjects and found extensive immune dysfunction due to the presence and functional activity of T regulatory cells, CD4(+)PD-1(+) exhausted effector T cells and myeloid-derived  suppressor cells. Manipulation of these immunosuppressive networks in COPD could  provide a rational strategy to restore functional immune responses, reduce exacerbations, and improve lung function. In this review, we discuss the role of  immune dysfunction in COPD that may contribute to recurrent respiratory infections and disease severity."

Due to improvements in chemotherapeutic choices and supportive care, patients currently typically undergo multiple lines  of chemotherapy as their disease progresses. Although treatments have improved over recent years, limited benefits are seen, especially in patients receiving later-line chemotherapy, as response rates can be low, response duration short and survival poor. Molecular-targeted therapies have provided improvement in outcomes. However, these treatments only offer a clear benefit in subsets of tumors harbouring the appropriate genomic alteration (mutation, amplification, translocation). Recent advances in immunotherapy have highlighted the potential of immuno-oncology-based treatments for NSCLC, offering the potential to provide  durable responses and outcomes regardless of histology or mutation status. Blocking inhibitory pathways such as the cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4)  and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) checkpoint pathways with monoclonal antibodies has generated antitumor immune responses that are transforming cancer therapeutics. PD-1 and programmed cell death ligand-1(PD-L1) antibodies have shown durable responses in NSCLC, with a favourable safety profile and manageable side-effects. The activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors is currently been assessed in treatment-naïve patients with PD-L1-positive advanced NSCLC. Combinatorial approaches with other immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, or targeted-agents are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, and may improve outcome in NSCLC. The emerging data not only offer the hope of a better cancer therapy but also provide evidence that changes our understanding on how the host  immune system interacts with human cancer. It is therefore conceivable that agents blocking the CTLA-4/PD-1/PD-L1 axis will provide valuable additions to the growing armamentarium of targeted-agents."

However, whether this pathway is involved in the surgery-induced dysfunction of T lymphocytes is not known.

We found that surgery increased PD-1/PD-L1 expression on immune cells, which was correlated with the severity of surgical trauma. The count of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells reduced after surgery, probably due to the increased activity of caspase-3. Caspase-3 level was positively correlated with PD-1 expression. Profile of perioperative cytokines and hormones in plasma showed a significantly  increased level of interferon-α, as well as various inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones. In ex vivo experiments, administration of anti-PD-1 antibody significantly ameliorated T-cell proliferation and partially reversed the T-cell  apoptosis induced by surgical trauma. We provide evidences that surgical trauma can induce immunosuppression through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. This pathway could be a target for preventing postoperative cellular immunosuppression."

This review summarizes current knowledge and potential clinical implications of PD-L1 expression in glioblastoma. At present, the following conclusions are drawn: (a)  functional data support a role for PD-1/PD-L1 in tumor-associated immunosuppression in glioblastoma; (b) the incidence of PD-L1-expressing glioblastomas seems to be relatively high in comparison to other tumor types, however, the reported rates of glioblastomas with PD-L1 protein expression vary and range from 61 to 88%; (c) there is considerable variability in the methodology of PD-L1 assessment in glioblastoma across studies with heterogeneity in utilized antibodies, tissue sampling strategies, immunohistochemical staining  protocols, cut-off definitions, and evaluated staining patterns; (d) there are conflicting data on the prognostic role and so far no data on the predictive role of PD-L1 gene and protein expression in glioblastoma. In summary, the ongoing clinical studies evaluating the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in glioblastoma need to be complemented with well designed and stringently executed studies to understand the influence of PD-1/PD-L1 expression on therapy response or failure  and to develop robust means of PD-L1 assessment for meaningful biomarker development."

A promising strategy includes adoptive T cell therapy which has been studied in small cohorts of synovial sarcoma, a subtype that is known to widely express the cancer testis antigen, NY-ESO-1. Additionally, recent data in metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma demonstrate the utility and tremendous efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade with increased rates of durable responses compared to standard therapies. Responses in traditionally non-immunogenic tumors, such as  lung and bladder cancers, provide ample rationale for the study of immune checkpoint inhibitors in sarcoma. While immunotherapy has induced some responses  in sarcomas, further research will help clarify optimal patient selection for future clinical trials and new combinatorial immunotherapeutic strategies."

For example, drugs targeting the PD-1 immune checkpoint have been proven to be an effective therapeutic approach in several solid tumors including melanoma and lung cancer. Very recently, the activity of such therapeutics has also been demonstrated in breast cancer patients. Pari passu with the development of novel immune modulators, the transcriptomic analysis of human tumors unveiled unexpected and paradoxical relationships between cancer cells and immune cells. This review examines our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with intratumoral immune response, which represents a critical step for the implementation of stratification strategies toward the development of personalized immunotherapy of breast cancer."

It exhibits aggressive behaviour and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Recently, immunotherapy targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway has demonstrated favourable clinical outcomes in NSCLC. However,  the expression patterns of PD-1-related molecules in pulmonary PC remain elusive. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was estimated in 41 cases of PC using immunohistochemistry. CD8(+) and PD-1(+) tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were also evaluated. PD-L1 and PD-L2 were highly expressed in pulmonary PCs (90.2% [37/41)]; 87.8% [36/41]). The amount of CD8(+) or PD-1(+) TILs and the ratio of PD-1(+)/CD8(+) TILs in PC were higher in males, smokers and older patients. PD-L1-positive PCs were infiltrated by higher numbers of CD8(+) TILs compared to PD-L1-negative cases (P=0.006). Of note, PD-L1 expression in pulmonary PCs was significantly higher in sarcomatous areas than in the carcinomatous portion (P=0.006). PC patients with a high ratio of PD-1(+)/CD8(+)  TILs showed a shorter progression-free survival (P=0.036), whereas PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression had no prognostic implications. Our study demonstrates that pulmonary PCs very frequently express PD-L1 and PD-L2. Moreover, their expression is higher in sarcomatous cells than in carcinomatous areas. Thus, targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may represent a potential therapeutic candidate for this aggressive tumour."

However, during acute viral lower respiratory infection, lung TCD8 are functionally impaired and do not optimally control viral replication. T cells also become unresponsive to Ag during chronic  infections and cancer via signaling by inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). PD-1 also contributes to TCD8 impairment during viral lower  respiratory infection, but how it regulates TCD8 impairment and the connection between this state and T cell exhaustion during chronic infections are unknown. In this study, we show that PD-1 operates in a cell-intrinsic manner to impair lung TCD8. In light of this, we compared global gene expression profiles of impaired epitope-specific lung TCD8 to functional spleen TCD8 in the same human metapneumovirus-infected mice. These two populations differentially regulate hundreds of genes, including the upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors by lung TCD8. We then compared the gene expression of TCD8 during human metapneumovirus infection to those in acute or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. We find that the immunophenotype of lung TCD8 more closely resembles T cell exhaustion late into chronic infection than do functional effector T cells arising early in acute infection. Finally, we demonstrate that trafficking to the infected lung alone is insufficient for TCD8  impairment or inhibitory receptor upregulation, but that viral Ag-induced TCR signaling is also required. Our results indicate that viral Ag in infected lungs  rapidly induces an exhaustion-like state in lung TCD8 characterized by progressive functional impairment and upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors."

However, whether EML4-ALK regulates PD-L1 expression in lung cancer remains unknown. A total of 532 pulmonary adenocarcinomas (pADCs), including 58 ALK-translocated tumors, were immunohistochemically evaluated for PD-L1 and PD-1. H23 (EGFRWild-typeEML4-ALK-PD-L1Low) and H2228 (EGFRWild-typeEML4-ALK+PD-L1High) cells were transfected with EML4-ALK or ALK short interfering RNAs and used to investigate the alterations in PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression was detected in 81% of ALK-translocated pADCs; this value was significantly higher than those of  pADCs with EGFR mutation, KRAS mutation or lacking ALK, EGFR or KRAS mutation (p  <0.005 for all). Moreover, ALK-translocated pADC with PD-L1 expression showed significantly higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating PD-1+ cells. ALK knockdown or  inhibition (crizotinib treatment) in H2228 cells downregulated PD-L1 expression.  Transfection of H23 cells with EML4-ALK enhanced PD-L1 expression, which was compromised by crizotinib treatment. This ALK-dependent upregulation of PD-L1 expression was mediated by STAT3 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α under normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, EML4-ALK enhanced HIF-1α expression through increasing transcription and decreasing ubiquitination of HIF-1α. In ALK-translocated pADC tissues, significant positive correlations between PD-L1 and nuclear HIF-1α (p < 0.05) or pSTAT3 expression levels (p<0.005) were observed. Among patients with ALK-translocated pADC, strong PD-L1 expression was  significantly associated with shorter progression-free (p = 0.001) and overall survival (p = 0.002) after crizotinib treatment. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that ALK-derived pADCs increase PD-L1 expression via HIF-1α and/or STAT3, thus providing a rationale for PD-1/PD-L1 pathway-targeted therapy in ALK-translocated lung cancer."

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) mutation data obtained from melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients published by Snyder et al. 2014 and Rizvi et al. 2015, respectively, were used to select nonsynonymous somatic mutations occurring in genes included in the Foundation Medicine Panel (FM-CGP) and in our own Institutional Panel (HSL-CGP). CGP-mutational load was calculated for each patient using both panels  and was associated with clinical outcomes as defined and reported in the original articles. Higher CGP-mutational load was observed in NSCLC patients presenting durable clinical benefit (DCB) to PD-1 blockade (FM-CGP P=0.03, HSL-CGP P=0.01).  We also observed that 69% of patients with high CGP-mutational load experienced DCB to PD-1 blockade, as compared to 20% of patients with low CGP-mutational load (FM-CGP and HSL-CGP P=0.01). Noteworthy, predictive accuracy of CGP-mutational load for DCB was not statistically different from that estimated by WES sequencing (P=0.73). Moreover, a high CGP-mutational load was significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with PD-1 blockade (FM-CGP P=0.005, HR 0.27, 95% IC 0.105 to 0.669; HSL-CGP P=0.008, HR 0.29, 95% IC 0.116 to 0.719).

In this randomized, open-label, international phase 3 study, we assigned patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that had progressed  during or after platinum-based doublet chemotherapy to receive nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks or docetaxel at a dose of  75 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks. The primary end point  was overall survival. Overall survival was longer with nivolumab than with docetaxel. The median overall survival was 12.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.7 to 15.0) among 292 patients in the nivolumab group and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.7) among 290 patients in the docetaxel group (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; P=0.002). At 1 year, the overall survival rate was 51% (95% CI, 45 to 56) with nivolumab versus 39% (95% CI, 33 to 45) with docetaxel. With additional follow-up, the overall survival rate at 18 months was 39% (95% CI, 34  to 45) with nivolumab versus 23% (95% CI, 19 to 28) with docetaxel. The response  rate was 19% with nivolumab versus 12% with docetaxel (P=0.02). Although progression-free survival did not favor nivolumab over docetaxel (median, 2.3 months and 4.2 months, respectively), the rate of progression-free survival at 1  year was higher with nivolumab than with docetaxel (19% and 8%, respectively). Nivolumab was associated with even greater efficacy than docetaxel across all end points in subgroups defined according to prespecified levels of tumor-membrane expression (≥1%, ≥5%, and ≥10%) of the PD-1 ligand. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were reported in 10% of the patients in the nivolumab group, as compared with 54% of those in the docetaxel group. Among patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC that had progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy, overall survival was longer with nivolumab than with docetaxel.

VSV that produces interferon-β (VSV-IFNβ) is now in early clinical testing for solid  tumors. Here, the preclinical activity of VSV and VSV-IFNβ against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is reported. NSCLC cell lines were treated in vitro with VSV  expressing green fluorescence protein (VSV-GFP) and VSV-IFNβ. VSV-GFP and VSV-IFNβ were active against NSCLC cells. JAK/STAT inhibition with ruxolitinib re-sensitized resistant H838 cells to VSV-IFNβ mediated oncolysis. Intratumoral injections of VSV-GFP and VSV-IFNβ reduced tumor growth and weight in H2009 nude  mouse xenografts (p < 0.01). A similar trend was observed in A549 xenografts. Syngeneic LM2 lung tumors grown in flanks of A/J mice were injected with VSV-IFNβ intratumorally. Treatment of LM2 tumors with VSV-IFNβ resulted in tumor regression, prolonged survival (p < 0.0001), and cure of 30% of mice. Intratumoral injection of VSV-IFNβ resulted in decreased tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Treg) and increased CD8+ T cells. Tumor cell expression of PDL-1 was increased after VSV-IFNβ treatment. VSV-IFNβ has potent antitumor effects and promotes systemic antitumor immunity. These data support further clinical investigation of VSV-IFNβ for NSCLC."

Using HIV-1 GAG-p24 in a model PD1-based DNA vaccine, we recently reported that vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells conferred complete prevention and therapeutic cure of AB1-GAG malignant mesothelioma in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. Here, we further investigated the efficacy and correlation of protection on the model vaccine-mediated antigen spreading against wild-type AB1 (WT-AB1) mesothelioma. We found that this vaccine was able to protect mice completely from three consecutive lethal challenges of AB1-GAG mesothelioma. Through antigen spreading these animals also developed tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, but neither CD4+ T cells nor antibodies, rejecting WT-AB1 mesothelioma. A majority of these protected mice (90%) were also completely protected against the lethal WT-AB1 challenge. Adoptive cell transfer  experiments further demonstrated that antigen spreading-induced CD8+ T cells conferred efficacious therapeutic effects against established WT-AB1 mesothelioma and prevented the increase of exhausted PD-1+ and Tim-3+ CD8+ T cells. A significant inverse correlation was found between the frequency of functional PD1-Tim3- CD8+ T cells and that of MDSCs or tumor mass in vivo. Mechanistically,  we found that WT-AB1 mesothelioma induced predominantly polymorphonuclear (PMN) MDSCs in vivo. In co-cultures with efficacious CD8+ T cells, a significant number of PMN-MDSCs underwent apoptosis in a dose-dependent way. Our findings indicate that efficacious CD8+ T cells capable of eliminating both tumor cells and MDSCs are likely necessary for fighting wild-type malignant mesothelioma."

Unlike non-squamous NSCLC, squamous NSCLC rarely harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations for which there are directed therapies, and until the recent approval of immunotherapies for squamous NSCLC, a limited number of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs have been FDA-approved for use in the treatment of advanced and metastatic squamous NSCLC. Immunotherapies directed at  the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) (nivolumab and  pembrolizumab) have demonstrated efficacy in both nonsquamous and squamous cell NSCLC. Because of their similar mechanism of action against the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway, both drugs have similar toxicity profiles related to immune-mediated adverse reactions that can generally be monitored and managed with oral corticosteroids. This paper provides an overview of drug therapy options for squamous cell NSCLC with a focus on the evidence and clinical application of the  anti-PD1 therapies. A comparison of the dosing, administration, indications, and  differences in the measurement of PD-L1 expression in the clinical trials of nivolumab and pembrolizumab is also provided."

The vaccines were aimed at activating type I CD4(+)T cells and consisted of tumor cells transfected with genes encoding syngeneic MHC class II and CD80 costimulatory molecules, and lacking the MHC II-associated invariant chain. The vaccines showed some efficacy in mice with sarcoma, melanoma, and breast cancer and activated MHC class II syngeneic T cells from breast, lung, and melanoma patients. During the course of the vaccine studies, we observed that CD80 not only costimulated naïve T cells, but also bound to PD-L1 and prevented tumor cell-expressed PD-L1 from binding to its receptor PD-1 on activated T cells. A soluble form of CD80 (CD80-Fc) had the same effect and sustained IFNγ production  by both human and murine PD-1(+) activated T cells in the presence of PD-L1(+) human or mouse tumor cells, respectively. In vitro studies with human tumor cells indicated that CD80-Fc was more effective than antibodies to either PD-1 or PD-L1 in sustaining T cell production of IFNγ. Additionally, in vivo studies with a murine tumor demonstrated that CD80-Fc was more effective than antibodies to PD-L1 in extending survival time. Studies with human T cells blocked for CD28 and with T cells from CD28 knockout mice demonstrated that CD80-Fc simultaneously inhibited PD-L1/PD-1-mediated immune suppression and delivered costimulatory signals to activated T cells, thereby amplifying T cell activation. These results suggest that CD80-Fc may be a useful monotherapy that minimizes PD-1 pathway immune suppression while simultaneously activating tumor-reactive T cells."

Along with extended survival, these agents are accompanied by a host of cutaneous complications that affect the skin, hair, and nails. These skin complications range from the well-characterized papulopustular (acneiform) eruption of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors to the emerging characterization of lichenoid skin eruptions seen during treatment with antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1). When promptly recognized and accurately diagnosed, most cutaneous adverse events can be managed with supportive treatments, avoiding the need to interrupt antitumor therapy. Furthermore, preemptive management of skin problems can lead to significantly decreased severity of many cutaneous complications of these therapies. We encourage close collaboration between dermatologists and oncologists to better characterize cutaneous toxicity, select appropriate management, and avoid unnecessary dose reduction or discontinuation while simultaneously improving patient quality of life."

Here, we  investigated whether local viral infection of malignant tumors is capable of overcoming systemic resistance to PD-1-immunotherapy by modulating the spectrum of tumor-directed CD8 T-cells. To focus on neoantigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses, we performed transcriptomic sequencing of PD-1-resistant CMT64 lung adenocarcinoma cells followed by algorithm-based neoepitope prediction. Investigations on neoepitope-specific T-cell responses in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that PD-1 immunotherapy was insufficient whereas viral oncolysis elicited cytotoxic T-cell responses to a conserved panel of neoepitopes. After combined treatment, we observed that PD-1-blockade did not affect the magnitude of oncolysis-mediated antitumoral immune responses but a broader spectrum of T-cell responses including additional neoepitopes was observed. Oncolysis of the  primary tumor significantly abrogated systemic resistance to PD-1-immunotherapy leading to improved elimination of disseminated lung tumors. Our observations were confirmed in a transgenic murine model of liver cancer where viral oncolysis strongly induced PD-L1 expression in primary liver tumors and lung metastasis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined treatment completely inhibited dissemination in a CD8 T-cell-dependent manner. Therefore, our results strongly recommend further evaluation of virotherapy and concomitant PD-1 immunotherapy in clinical studies."

These immunotherapies are associated with unique set of toxicities termed immune-related adverse events (irAEs) that are very different from toxicities observed with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prompt recognition and initiation of appropriate management, usually in the form of immunosuppression, usually results in complete reversibility, but failing to do so can lead to severe toxicity or even death. Clinical algorithms describing the management of common irAEs have been published based on clinical trial information and experience in metastatic melanoma with ipilimumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks T cell inhibition. The most common irAEs reported with ipilimumab are dermatologic toxicity, diarrhea/colitis, hepatotoxicity, and endocrinopathies, although other sites can also be affected.  Similar irAEs have been observed with agents targeting PD-1. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind to PD-1 and prevent T cell inactivation.

Targeted therapies directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations, and ROS-1 rearrangements have demonstrated improved progression free survival (PFS) and, in selected populations, improved overall survival (OS) compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies against programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), have now also demonstrated improved survival compared with chemotherapy. The use of these novel systemic agents in non-metastatic patient populations and in combination with radiation therapy is not well defined. As radiation therapy has become more effective and more conformal with fewer toxicities, it has increasingly been used in the oligometastatic or oligoprogression setting. This has allowed improvement in PFS and potentially OS, and in the oligoprogressive setting may overcome acquired drug resistance of a specific lesion(s) to allow patients to remain on their targeted therapies. Molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies for patients with metastatic NSCLC have demonstrated much success. Advances in radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy, radiation therapy have led to combination strategies with targeted therapies among patients with lung cancer. Radiation therapy has also been combined with immunotherapies predominantly in the metastatic setting. In the metastatic population, radiation therapy has the ability to provide durable local control and also augment the immune response of  systemic agents, which may lead to an abscopal effect of immune-mediated tumor response in disease sites outside of the radiation field in select patients."

The HepA mouse models were used to observe tumor recurrence, intrahepatic metastasis and remote metastasis. NK cell, αβ T cell and γδ T cell were used to explore the underlying  mechanisms for anti-tumor effect of indomethacin. The results showed that long-term use of indomethacin facilitated intrahepatic recurrence, intrahepatic dissemination and lung metastasis, and indomethacin inhibits TNF-α and IFN-γ in vivo and in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, long-term use of indomethacin increased the expression of PD-1 and PD-L2 in programmed death-1 pathway.

Lately, better understanding of the role of the immunological system in tumor control has opened multiple doors to implement different strategies to enhance immune response against cancer cells. It is known that tumor cells elude  immune response by several mechanisms. The development of monoclonal antibodies against the checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), on T cells, has led to high activity in cancer patients with long lasting responses. Nivolumab, an anti PD-1 inhibitor, has been recently approved  for the treatment of squamous cell lung cancer patients, given the survival advantage demonstrated in a phase III trial. Pembrolizumab, another anti PD-1 antibody, has received FDA breakthrough therapy designation for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), supported by data from a phase I trial. Clinical trials with anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in NSCLC have demonstrated very good tolerability and activity, with response rates around 20% and a median duration of response of 18 months."

We have now examined PD-L1 expression and its regulation in NSCLC positive for the EML4-ALK fusion gene. The expression of PD-L1 at the protein and mRNA levels in NSCLC cell lines was examined by flow cytometry and by reverse transcription and  real-time PCR analysis, respectively. The expression of PD-L1 in 134 surgically resected NSCLC specimens was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. The PD-L1 expression level was higher in NSCLC cell lines positive for EML4-ALK than in those negative for the fusion gene. Forced expression of EML4-ALK in Ba/F3 cells markedly increased PD-L1 expression, whereas endogenous PD-L1 expression in EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC cells was attenuated by treatment with the specific ALK inhibitor alectinib or by RNAi with ALK siRNAs. Furthermore, expression of PD-L1 was downregulated by inhibitors of the MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways in NSCLC cells positive for either EML4-ALK or activating mutations of the EGFR. Finally, the expression level of PD-L1 was positively associated with the presence of EML4-ALK in NSCLC specimens. Our findings that both EML4-ALK and mutant EGFR upregulate PD-L1 by  activating PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK signaling pathways in NSCLC reveal a direct link  between oncogenic drivers and PD-L1 expression."

In models of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR signal upregulates PD-1/PD-L1. However, data on the clinical significance of PD1/PD-L1 expression in patients with the subtype of NSCLC carrying EGFR mutations remain limited. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs). In a cohort of 56 patients, PD-L1 and PD-1 was positive in 53.6% and 32.1% of tumor specimens, respectively. PD-L1(+) patients had a significantly greater disease-control rate (P = .004), in association with longer progression-free survival (P = .001) after EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and overall survival (P = .004), and no correlation between PD-1 positivity and clinical outcomes was observed. PD-L1 expression was not significantly associated with either clinicopathologic features or TILs. These findings suggest that this subtype of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC is highly eligible for PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. PD-L1 might represent a favorable biomarker candidate for the response to EGFR-TKIs and outcomes of these patients with NSCLC."

First clinical trials with therapies targeting the programmed cell death receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 have shown promising results in several solid tumors. However, in lung cancer the diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of these immunologic factors remains  unclear. METHOD: The impact of both factors was evaluated in a study collective of 321 clinically well-annotated patients with non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) using immunohistochemistry. PD-1 expression by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was found in 22%, whereas tumor cell associated PD-L1 expression was observed in 24% of the NSCLC tumors. In Fisher's exact test a positive correlation was found for PD-L1 and Bcl-xl protein expression (p = 0.013). Interestingly, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was associated with improved overall survival in pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas (SCC, p = 0.042, log rank test), with adjuvant therapy (p = 0.017), with increased tumor size (pT2-4, p = 0.039) and with positive lymph node status (pN1-3, p = 0.010). These observations were confirmed by multivariate cox  regression models. CONCLUSION: One major finding of our study is the identification of a prognostic  implication of PD-L1 in subsets of NSCLC patients with pulmonary SCC, with increased tumor size, with a positive lymph node status and NSCLC patients who received adjuvant therapies. This study provides first data for immune-context related risk stratification of NSCLC patients. Further studies are necessary both to confirm this observation and to evaluate the predictive value of PD-1 and PD-L1 in NSCLC in the context of PD-1 inhibition."

Although great progress has been made in investigating genetic aberrations and putative drivers of this tumor entity, the mechanisms of rapid dissemination and acquisition of drug resistance are not clear. The majority of SCLC cases are characterized by inactivation of the tumor suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) and, therefore, interchangeable drivers will be difficult to  target successfully. Access to pure cultures of SCLC circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and study of their tumor biology has revealed a number of new potential targets. Most important, expression of chitinase-3-like-1/YKL-40 (CHI3L1) which controls expression of vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) was newly described in these cells. The process switching CHI3L1-negative SCLC cells to CHI3L1-positive CTCs seems to be associated with cytokines released by inflammatory immune cells. Furthermore, these CTCs were found to promote monocyte-macrophage differentiation, most likely of the M2 tumor-promoting type, recently described to express PD-1 immune checkpoint antigen in SCLC. In conclusion, dissemination of SCLC seems to be linked to conversion of regular tumor cells to highly invasive CHI3L1-positive CTCs, which are protected by immune system suppression. Besides the classical targets VEGF, MMP-9 and PD-1, CHI3L1 constitutes a new possibly drugable molecule to retard down dissemination of SCLC cells, which may be similarly relevant for glioblastoma and other tumor entities."

Given observations that fetal exposure to infectious pathogens in utero can result in reduced immune responses, or tolerance, to those pathogens postnatally, we hypothesized that fetal exposure to HIV may render the fetus tolerant to the virus, thus reducing damage caused by immune activation during infection later in life. To test this hypothesis, fetal rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were injected with the attenuated virus SIVmac1A11 in utero and challenged with pathogenic SIVmac239 1 year after birth. SIVmac1A11-injected animals had significantly reduced plasma RNA viral loads (P < 0.02) up to 35 weeks after infection. Generalized estimating equations analysis was performed to identify immunologic and clinical measurements associated with plasma RNA viral load. A positive association with plasma RNA viral load was observed with the proportion  of CD8(+) T cells expressing the transcription factor, FoxP3, and the proportion  of CD4(+) T cells producing the lymphoproliferative cytokine, IL-2. In contrast,  an inverse relationship was found with the frequencies of circulating CD4(+) and  CD8(+) T cells displaying intermediate expression of the proliferation marker, Ki-67. Animals exposed to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in utero appeared to have enhanced SIV-specific immune responses, a lower proportion of CD8(+) T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1, and more circulating TH17 cells than controls. Although the development of tolerance was not demonstrated, these data  suggest that rhesus monkeys exposed to SIVmac1A11 in utero had distinct immune responses associated with the control of viral replication after postnatal challenge."

However, the crosstalk between tumor and immune cells is poorly understood. Glycodelin (gene name PAEP), initially described in the context of pregnancy and trophoblastic implantation, is a secreted immunosuppressive glycoprotein with an as-of-yet largely unknown function in lung cancer. In this study, we characterized the expression and role of glycodelin in NSCLC through mRNA and protein expression analyses, functional knockdown experiments, and correlations with clinicopathologic parameters. Glycodelin mRNA expression was significantly elevated in tumors (n = 336) compared with matched normal tissue (P < 0.0001). Overall survival (OS) was  significantly reduced in NSCLC with high glycodelin mRNA levels in women but not  in men. Glycodelin was detected in the sera of patients, and the levels correlated with recurrence and metastatic disease. Knockdown of glycodelin with siRNAs in NSCLC cell lines resulted in significant upregulation of immune system  modulatory factors such as PDL1, CXCL5, CXCL16, MICA/B, and CD83 as well as proliferation stimulators EDN1 and HBEGF. Furthermore, decreased migration of tumor cells was observed. Altogether, the comprehensive characterization of glycodelin in NSCLC provides strong support for its use as a biomarker with immune modulatory function."

The prognostic roles of and clinicopathological factors associated with immune checkpoint gene expression, CTLA-4 and PDCD1 remain largely undefined, which encodes cytotoxic-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), respectively. We used a lung cancer database of 1715 patients measured by Affymetrix microarrays to analyze the association of gene expression with clinicopathological factors and survival. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for overall survival (OS) were calculated. Cutoffs were determined  by median across the entire database. In 909 patients with histology information, significantly higher PDCD1 and CTLA-4 expression were found in squamous carcinoma than adenocarcinoma. In 848 patients with known smoking history, current/former smokers were found to have significantly elevated gene expression compared with nonsmokers. Significant higher expression of both genes were found in TNM stage II versus I. Higher expression of PDCD1 predicted worse OS in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.53-2.79). CTLA-4 was marginally significant in  univariate analysis of the entire set (HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.99-1.34). In patients  with information for multivariate analysis, higher expression of CTLA-4 was associated with worse OS (HR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.18-3.31). In this study with large number of patients, PDCD1 and CTLA-4 expression is significantly higher in squamous carcinoma and current/former smokers. Higher expression of CTLA-4, but not PDCD1 predicts worse survival."

The expression of PD-L1 was significantly correlated with abdominal organ metastasis (P = 0.004). A high PD-L1 expression had a worse prognosis than a low expression in patients (18.7 vs. 26.8 month, P < 0.001). PD-L1 was elevated in advanced NSCLC patients and may play an important role in tumor immune evasion and patient prognosis."

Recent evidence suggests that the coinhibitory PD-1-PD-L1 axis plays a major role in ACT failure. We hypothesized that a new fusion receptor reverting PD-1-mediated inhibition into CD28 costimulation may break peripheral tolerance. Different PD-1-CD28 fusion receptor constructs were created and retrovirally transduced into primary T cell receptor transgenic murine CD8(+) T cells specific for ovalbumin (OT-1). Cytokine release, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and tumor recognition were analyzed in vitro. Antitumor efficacy and mode of action were investigated in mice bearing subcutaneous tumors induced  with the pancreatic carcinoma cell line Panc02 expressing the model antigen ovalbumin (Panc-OVA). For antitumoral efficacy, six to eight mice per group were  used. All statistical tests are two-sided. Transduction of the PD-1-CD28 receptor constructs mediated enhanced cytokine release, T cell proliferation, and T cell-induced lysis of target tumor  cells. The PD-1-CD28 receptor function was dependent on two of the CD28-signaling motifs and IFN-γ release. Treatment of mice with established Panc-OVA tumors with fusion receptor-transduced OT-1 T cells mediated complete tumor regression. Mice  rejecting the tumor were protected upon subsequent rechallenge with either ovalbumin-positive or -negative tumors, indicative of a memory response and epitope spreading in nine of 11 mice vs none of the six naïve mice (P < .001). Treatment efficacy was associated with accumulation of IFN-γ-producing T cells and an increased ratio of CD8(+) T cells to immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumors. Transduction of T cells with this new PD-1-CD28 receptor has the potential of breaking the PD-1-PD-L1-immunosuppressive axis in ACT."

Overall response rate (ORR) was extracted from phase I-III trials investigating nivolumab, pembrolizumab and MPDL3280A for advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and genitourinary cancer, and cumulated by adopting a fixed and random-effect model with 95% confidence interval (CI). Interaction test according to tumor PD-L1 was accomplished. A sensitivity analysis according to adopted drug, tumor type, PD-L1 cut-off and treatment line  was performed. Twenty trials (1,475 patients) were identified. A significant interaction (p<0.0001) according to tumor PD-L1 expression was found in the overall sample with an ORR of 34.1% (95% CI 27.6-41.3%) in the PD-L1 positive and 19.9% (95% CI 15.4-25.3%) in the PD-L1 negative population. ORR was significantly higher in PD-L1 positive in comparison to PD-L1 negative patients for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, with an absolute difference of 16.4% and 19.5%, respectively.  A significant difference in activity of 22.8% and 8.7% according to PD-L1 was found for melanoma and NSCLC, respectively, with no significant difference for genitourinary cancer. CONCLUSION: Overall, the three antibodies provide a significant differential effect in terms of activity according to PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. The predictive value of PD-L1 on tumor cells seems to be more robust for anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), and in the context of advanced melanoma and NSCLC."

Increased number of total CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Treg cells and elevated expressions on the surface of several inhibitory molecules including CTLA-4, LAG-3 and PD-1 have been observed in the peripheral blood of NSCLC patients. We found that intratumoral Treg cells from NSCLC patients express the highest levels of co-inhibitory molecules compared to Treg cells isolated from tumor adjacent tissues or from peripheral blood of cancer patients, which is in consistent with  the enhanced immunosuppressive function of these co-inhibitory molecules. Moreover, the number of Treg cells and their functional surface molecules increased during the progression of lung cancer. Elevated plasma levels of TGF-β  and IL-10 in NSCLC patients were also observed in NSCLC patients compared to that in healthy volunteers. Our findings further support the role of Treg cells in the tumor microenvironments in NSCLC patients."

Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is expressed in a group of cancers that may be suitable targets for specific immunotherapy. This study investigated the expression and clinical value of PD-L1 in pulmonary LELC. Seventy-nine patients with pulmonary LELC were investigated. Paraffin-embedded tumor sections were stained with PD-L1 antibody. Correlations of PD-L1 expression with clinicopathologic parameters and outcomes were analyzed. Fifty patients (63.3%) were PD-L1 positive. The 3-year and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 76.0% and 68.0%, respectively, and the 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 88.0% and 79.0%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with positive PD-L1 expression had longer PFS and OS than those with negative PD-L1 expression (P=0.019 and P=0.042, respectively). In a multivariate Cox regression model including age, tumor size,  stage, and PD-L1 expression status, the latter three factors were found to be independent predictors of PFS (P=0.023, P=0.000, and P=0.009, respectively), but  only stage was found to be an independent factor for OS (P=0.007), and PD-L1 expression status showed a trend to be independently correlated with OS (P=0.080). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that a large proportion of patients with pulmonary LELC had positive expression of PD-L1, supporting the potential use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapies in this distinct type of NSCLC."

We investigated TIL subsets and their prognostic impact in 116 BM specimens using immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD8, CD45RO, FOXP3, PD1 and PD-L1. The Immunoscore  was calculated as published previously. Overall, we found TIL infiltration in 115/116 (99.1%) BM specimens. PD-L1 expression was evident in 19/67 (28.4%) BM specimens and showed no correlation with TIL density (p > 0.05). TIL density was  not associated with corticosteroid administration (p > 0.05). A significant difference in infiltration density according to TIL subtype was present (p < 0.001; Chi Square); high infiltration was most frequently observed for CD3+ TILs  (95/116; 81.9%) and least frequently for PD1+ TILs (18/116; 15.5%; p < 0.001). Highest TIL density was observed in melanoma, followed by renal cell cancer and lung cancer BM (p < 0.001). The density of CD8+ TILs correlated positively with the extent of peritumoral edema seen on pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging  (p = 0.031). The density of CD3+ (15 vs. 6 mo; p = 0.015), CD8+ (15 vs. 11 mo; p  = 0.030) and CD45RO+ TILs (18 vs. 8 mo; p = 0.006) showed a positive correlation  with favorable median OS times. Immunoscore showed significant correlation with survival prognosis (27 vs. 10 mo; p < 0.001). The prognostic impact of Immunoscore was independent from established prognostic parameters at multivariable analysis (HR 0.612, p < 0.001). In conclusion, our data indicate that dense TILs infiltrates are common in BM and correlate with the amount of peritumoral brain edema and survival prognosis, thus identifying the immune system as potential biomarker for cancer patients with CNS affection. Further studies are needed to substantiate our findings."

Visual disturbance by choroidal metastasis significantly decreases quality of life during the patient's remaining lifespan; therefore, radiotherapy or laser photocoagulation is proposed with consensus. However, improvement in survival with matched molecular targeted  agents for oncogenic driver mutations reminds us to also be concerned with late treatment toxicities. A 30-year-old female patient previously treated with crizotinib harboring ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer complained of visual disturbance, fever, and bone pains undergoing anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. A decreased proportion of ALK fusion was demonstrated by fluorescence  in situ hybridization in liver metastasis compared to the primary site in a chemo-naïve state. She was diagnosed with low vision, choroidal metastasis and retinal detachment. Therefore, she started alectinib treatment and both her ocular and systemic symptoms were palliated in a week.

Many cell types in multiple tissues express PD-L1 as well as several tumor types, thereby suggesting that the ligand may play important roles in inhibiting immune  responses throughout the body. Therefore, PD-L1 is a critical immunomodulating component within the lung microenvironment, but the correlation between PD-L1 expression and prognosis is controversial. More evidence is required to support the use of PD-L1 as a potential predictive biomarker.

In B16F10, Colon 26, or Lewis lung carcinoma subcutaneous tumor models, administration of the anti-CD4 mAb alone had strong antitumor effects that were superior to those elicited by CD25(+) Treg depletion or other immune checkpoint mAbs, and which were completely reversed by CD8(+) cell depletion. CD4(+) cell depletion led to the proliferation of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells in the draining lymph node and increased infiltration of PD-1(+)CD8(+) T cells into the tumor, with a shift toward type I immunity within the tumor. Combination treatment with the anti-CD4  mAb and immune checkpoint mAbs, particularly anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAbs, synergistically suppressed tumor growth and greatly prolonged survival.

Recent immunotherapy advances have identified effective interventions to unleash tumor-specific T-cell activity in patients who naturally develop them. Eliciting T-cell responses to a patient's individual tumor remains a major challenge. Radiation therapy can induce immune responses to model antigens expressed by tumors, but it remains unclear whether it can effectively prime T cells specific for endogenous antigens expressed by poorly immunogenic tumors. We hypothesized that TGFβ activity is a major obstacle hindering the ability of radiation to generate an in situ tumor vaccine. Here, we show that antibody-mediated TGFβ neutralization during radiation therapy effectively generates CD8(+) T-cell responses to multiple endogenous tumor antigens in poorly immunogenic mouse carcinomas. Generated T cells were effective at causing regression of irradiated tumors and nonirradiated lung metastases or synchronous  tumors (abscopal effect). Gene signatures associated with IFNγ and immune-mediated rejection were detected in tumors treated with radiation therapy  and TGFβ blockade in combination but not as single agents. Upregulation of programmed death (PD) ligand-1 and -2 in neoplastic and myeloid cells and PD-1 on intratumoral T cells limited tumor rejection, resulting in rapid recurrence. Addition of anti-PD-1 antibodies extended survival achieved with radiation and TGFβ blockade. Thus, TGFβ is a fundamental regulator of radiation therapy's ability to generate an in situ tumor vaccine. The combination of local radiation  therapy with TGFβ neutralization offers a novel individualized strategy for vaccinating patients against their tumors."

Due to improvements in chemotherapeutic choices and supportive care, patients currently typically undergo multiple lines  of chemotherapy as their disease progresses. Although treatments have improved over recent years, limited benefits are seen, especially in patients receiving later-line chemotherapy, as response rates can be low, response duration short and survival poor. Furthermore, only a small percentage of patients derive benefit from later-line therapy, with most experiencing deteriorating quality of  life and significant toxicities. More recently, molecular targeted therapies have provided improvements in outcomes. However, these treatments only offer a clear benefit in subsets of tumours harbouring the appropriate genomic alteration (mutation, amplification, translocation). Most of the genomic abnormalities susceptible to therapeutic intervention are detected in adenocarcinoma, mainly in never smokers, while alterations in the genome of other histological subtypes are known but specific agents targeting these alterations have yet to be developed. Thus, the therapeutic management of these subtypes represents an ongoing challenge. Recent advances in immunotherapy have highlighted the potential of immuno-oncology based treatments for NSCLC, offering the potential to provide durable responses and outcomes regardless of histology or mutation status.

Little progress has been made in the field since imatinib was approved  for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in 2002 despite the recent FDA approval of the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib. Novel therapies are clearly needed. Immunotherapy utilizing checkpoint inhibitors has yielded significant clinical benefit in multiple solid tumors manifesting as durable responses in melanoma, kidney, lung, and bladder cancers, as well as hematologic malignancies. Given the success in several non-immunogenic tumors and recent preclinical data, there is sufficient evidence to support the use of immunotherapy in sarcoma. Cytokine-based therapies have shown no benefit in the advanced setting. Two large randomized trials of muramyl tripeptide or of interferon maintenance in resected osteosarcoma patients did not provide unequivocal statistically significant benefit. More promising results have been reported in small studies evaluating vaccines and adoptive T cell therapy in specific subtypes of sarcoma such as synovial sarcoma, which widely expresses the immunogenic cancer testis antigen NY-ESO-1. Emerging approaches with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells are hypothesis-generating and thought-provoking. However, the unprecedented clinical activity and excellent safety profile of checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death-1 receptor and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) have galvanized the field and generated much enthusiasm to harness the power of immunotherapy in pursuit of cures in patients with advanced sarcomas. An ongoing phase II study (SARC028) will hopefully usher an era of investigation of this exciting approach in sarcoma. However, it is unlikely that one agent will carry a universal cure and future approaches need to focus on patient selection as well as on identifying the optimal combination of checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy."

However, the molecular mechanism of PD-L1 regulation by EGFR activation and the potential clinical significance of blocking PD-1/PD-L1 in EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were largely unknown. Western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were employed to explore the association between PD-L1 and EGFR activation. Then, we used EGFR-TKIs and downstream pathways inhibitors to clarify the detailed signaling pathway involved in PD-L1 regulation. Cell apoptosis, viability, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test were used to study the immune suppression by EGFR activation and immune reactivation by EGFR-TKIs and/or PD-1 blocking in tumor cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells coculture system. We found that EGFR activation by EGF stimulation, exon-19 deletions, and L858R mutation could induce PD-L1 expression. EGFR activation upregulated PD-L1 through p-ERK1/2/p-c-Jun but not through p-AKT/p-S6 pathway. PD-L1 mediated by EGFR activation could induce the apoptosis of T cells through PD-L1/PD-1 axis in  tumor cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells coculture system. Inhibiting EGFR by EGFR-TKIs could free the inhibition of T cells and enhance the production of interferon-γ. Synergistic tumor cell killing effects were not observed with EGFR-TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibody combination treatment in coculture system. Our results imply that EGFR-TKIs could not only directly inhibit tumor cell viability but also indirectly enhance antitumor immunity through the downregulation of PD-L1. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies could be an optional therapy  for EGFR-TKI sensitive patients, especially for EGFR-TKIs resistant NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation.

MPDL3280A, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, has shown clear clinical activity in PD-L1-overexpressing bladder cancer with an objective response rate of 40-50%, resulting in a breakthrough therapy designation granted by FDA. These events pronounce the importance of targeting the PD-L1 pathway in the treatment of bladder cancer. In the present study, we investigated the prognostic significance of the expression of three genes in the PD-L1 pathway, including PD-L1, B7.1 and  PD-1, in three independent bladder cancer datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. PD-L1, B7.1 and PD-1 were significantly associated with clinicopathological parameters indicative of a more aggressive phenotype of bladder cancer, such as a more advanced stage and a higher tumor grade. In addition, a high level expression of PD-L1 was associated with reduced patient survival. Of note, the combination of PD-L1 and B7.1 expression, but not other combinations of the three genes, were also able to predict patient survival. Our  findings support the development of anti-PD-L1, which blocks PD-L1-PD-1 and B7.1-PD-L1 interactions, in treatment of bladder cancer. The observations were consistent in the three independent bladder cancer datasets consisting of a total of 695 human bladder specimens. The datasets were then assessed and it was found  that the expression levels of the chemokine CC-motif ligand (CCL), CCL3, CCL8 and CCL18, were correlated with the PD-L1 expression level, while ADAMTS13 was differentially expressed in patients with a different survival status (alive or deceased). Additional investigations are required to elucidate the role of these  genes in the PD-L1-mediated immune system suppression and bladder cancer progression. In conclusion, findings of this study suggested that PD-L1 is an important prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for bladder cancer."

Nivolumab, pembrolizumab  (formerly known as MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), and pidilizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical development for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers, lymphoma, and several other cancers. Long-term survivors already have been reported with these therapies. In this review, we discuss the current state of anti-PD-1 agents, the evidence in the literature to support the combination of anti-PD-1 antibodies with other anti-cancer agents and discuss the future directions for rational design of clinical trials that keep on increasing the number of long-term survivors."

Moreover, immune-related side effects and the costs of these therapies prompt the search for their precise mode of action and for biomarker discovery. Here, we describe different classes of immunologic correlates such as pharmacodynamic changes observed in all treated patients, correlates with response during treatment (surrogate markers) or at the time-point of tumor assessment, as well as predictive markers for response and for immune-related adverse events. This review gives an overview of available data about correlates  analyzed in the serum, all in immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood or in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. We will discuss how to prospectively validate and integrate these parameters for routine assessment of patients in daily clinical practice and give an outlook on promising future directions of biomarker research."

In particular, agents targeting immune checkpoints, such as the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) receptor and programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor, have shown in early clinical trials potential for improving tumor responses and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

A total of 56 human lung cancer tissue specimens were obtained from pathologically confirmed and newly diagnosed NSCLC patients. Infiltrating lymphocytes from both tumor tissues and adjacent normal lung tissues were analyzed for TIM-3 expression by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry.  Correlation analysis was performed between TIM-3 expression on TILs and the prognosis of the patients. The expression of TIM-3 on CD4+ TILs in tumor tissues [(28.64±10.46)%] was significantly higher than that on CD4+ T cells in adjacent normal tissues [(13.32±6.95)%]. Similarly, the expression of TIM-3 on CD8+ TILs in tumor tissues [(30.77±15.58)%] was up-regulated as compared with that on CD8+ T cells in adjacent normal tissues [(12.98±8.19)%]. Moreover, majority of the TIM-3 positive TILs from both adjacent normal tissues and tumor lung tissues were positive for another negative costimulatory molecule, programmed death 1 (PD-1). Importantly,  TIM-3 expression on CD4+ TILs was correlated with poor prognosis of the patients. CONCLUSION: TIM-3, as a key negative regulator in the anti-tumor immunity, contributes to the tumor immune evasion. It has an adverse influence on the prognosis of NSCLC patients."

Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment strategy,  but its role remains unclear in HCCs, which are associated with decreased cytotoxic CD8(+) T-lymphocyte infiltration in both murine and human tumors. Moreover, in mouse models after sorafenib treatment intratumoral hypoxia is increased and may fuel evasive resistance. Using orthotopic HCC models, we now show that increased hypoxia after sorafenib treatment promotes immunosuppression, characterized by increased intratumoral expression of the immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed death ligand-1 and accumulation of T-regulatory cells and M2-type macrophages. We also show that the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells is mediated in part by hypoxia-induced up-regulation of stromal cell-derived 1 alpha. Inhibition of the stromal cell-derived 1 alpha receptor (C-X-C receptor type 4 or CXCR4) using AMD3100 prevented the polarization toward an immunosuppressive microenvironment after sorafenib treatment, inhibited tumor growth, reduced lung metastasis, and improved survival. However, the combination  of AMD3100 and sorafenib did not significantly change cytotoxic CD8(+) T-lymphocyte infiltration into HCC tumors and did not modify their activation status. In separate experiments, antibody blockade of the programmed death ligand-1 receptor programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) showed antitumor effects in  treatment-naive tumors in orthotopic (grafted and genetically engineered) models  of HCC. However, anti-PD-1 antibody treatment had additional antitumor activity only when combined with sorafenib and AMD3100 and not when combined with sorafenib alone.CONCLUSION: Anti-PD-1 treatment can boost antitumor immune responses in HCC models; when used in combination with sorafenib, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy shows efficacy only with concomitant targeting of the hypoxic and immunosuppressive microenvironment with agents such as CXCR4 inhibitors."

However, the precise adverse effects of these therapies on thyroid  gland function have not been well described. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on 10 cases of painless thyroiditis syndrome (PTS) from a novel etiology, following immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) during treatment for metastatic malignancies. Six patients presented with transient thyrotoxicosis in which thyrotropin binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII) were absent for all, whereas four patients had evidence of positive antithyroid antibodies. All thyrotoxic patients required temporary beta-blocker therapy and had spontaneous resolution of thyrotoxicosis with subsequent hypothyroidism. Four patients presented with hypothyroidism without a  detected preceding thyrotoxic phase, occurring 6-8 weeks after initial drug exposure. All of these patients had positive antithyroid antibodies and required  thyroid hormone replacement therapy for a minimum of 6 months. Patients receiving anti-PD-1 mAb therapy should be monitored for signs and symptoms of PTS which may require supportive treatment with beta-blockers or thyroid hormone replacement. The anti-PD-1 mAb is a novel exogenous cause of PTS and provides new insight into the possible perturbations of the immune network that may modulate the development of endogenous PTS, including cases of sporadic and postpartum thyroiditis."

We evaluated PD-L1 expression in thymomas and thymic carcinomas to determine whether PD-L1 represents a therapeutic target in unresectable thymomas or thymic carcinomas that could be amenable to antibody-based immunotherapy. METHOD: A tissue microarray (TMA) comprised of 101 thymomas and 38 thymic carcinomas samples was evaluated. After validation of the rabbit monoclonal PD-L1 antibody (clone E1L3N), the TMA was stained and the tumor PD-L1 expression score  was calculated using a semiquantitive method (by multiplying the intensity [0-3]  by the staining area [0-100%]). Seventy percent of thymic carcinoma (type C) and 23% of thymoma (types A, AB, and B) samples stained positive for PD-L1 (P<.001). A WHO classification (type C vs types A, AB, and B) was significantly associated with positive PD-L1 expression (P=0.006), though multivariate analysis did not show PD-L1 positive was a significant negative factor of overall survival (hazard ratio=0.99, 95% confidence interval=0.35-2.73; P=0.987). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest-scale study to evaluate PD-L1 expression in thymomas and thymic carcinomas. The data suggest that the anti PD-1/PD-L1 drug could be of potential use in immunotherapy for unresectable or relapsed thymomas and thymic carcinomas."

Agents that antagonize immune tolerance will thus aid the fight against this devastating disease. Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family  modulate the magnitude, duration and phenotype of immune responsiveness to antigens. Among these, GITR expressed on immune cells functions as a key regulator in inflammatory and immune responses. Here, we evaluate the GITR agonistic antibody (DTA-1) as a mono-therapy and in combination with therapeutic  vaccination in murine lung cancer models. We found that DTA-1 treatment of tumor-bearing mice increased: (i) the frequency and activation of intratumoral natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes, (ii) the antigen presenting cell (APC) activity in the tumor, and (iii) systemic T-cell specific tumor cell cytolysis. DTA-1 treatment enhanced tumor cell apoptosis as quantified by cleaved caspase-3 staining in the tumors. DTA-1 treatment increased expression of IFNγ, TNFα and IL-12 but reduced IL-10 levels in tumors. Furthermore, increased anti-angiogenic chemokines corresponding with decreased pro-angiogenic chemokine  levels correlated with reduced expression of the endothelial cell marker Meca 32  in the tumors of DTA-1 treated mice. In accordance, there was reduced tumor growth (8-fold by weight) in the DTA-1 treatment group. NK cell depletion markedly inhibited the antitumor response elicited by DTA-1. DTA-1 combined with  therapeutic vaccination caused tumor rejection in 38% of mice and a 20-fold reduction in tumor burden in the remaining mice relative to control. Mice that rejected tumors following therapy developed immunological memory against subsequent re-challenge. Our data demonstrates GITR agonist antibody activated NK cell and T lymphocyte activity, and enhanced therapeutic vaccination responses against lung cancer."

This has been due in great part to the development of so-called checkpoint blockade. That is, antibodies that block inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and PD-1 and thus unleash antigen-specific immune responses against tumors. It is clear that tumors evade the immune response by usurping pathways that play a role in negatively regulating normal immune responses. In this regard, adenosine in the immune microenvironment leading to the activation of the A2a receptor has been shown to represent one such negative feedback loop. Indeed, the tumor microenvironment has relatively high concentrations of adenosine. To this end, blocking A2a receptor activation has the potential to markedly enhance anti-tumor immunity in mouse models. This review will present data demonstrating the ability of A2a receptor blockade to enhance tumor vaccines, checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell therapy. Also, as several recent studies have demonstrated that under certain conditions A2a receptor blockade can enhance tumor progression, we will also explore the complexities of adenosine signaling in the immune response. Despite important nuances to the A2a receptor pathway that require further elucidation, studies to  date strongly support the development of A2a receptor antagonists (some of which  have already been tested in phase III clinical trials for Parkinson Disease) as novel modalities in the immunotherapy armamentarium."

In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden  in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden.

In  concert with various mechanisms (including DNA instability), hypoxia and activation of inflammatory bioactive lipid pathways and pro-inflammatory cytokines open the doorway to malignant transformation and proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis in many cancers.

These include inhibitory checkpoints that modulate the extent and duration of the immune response and may be activated by tumor cells. This contributes to immune resistance, especially against tumor antigen-specific T-cells. Targeting these checkpoints is an evolving approach to cancer immunotherapy, designed to foster an immune response.

Therapeutics targeting this pathway are currently in clinical trials. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are the first of this anti-PD-1 pathway family of checkpoint inhibitors to gain accelerated approval from the US  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ipilimumab-refractory melanoma. Nivolumab has been associated with improved overall survival compared with dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated wild-type serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf proto-oncogene BRAF melanoma. Although the  most mature data are in the treatment of melanoma, the FDA has granted approval of nivolumab for squamous cell lung cancer and the breakthrough therapy designation to immune- checkpoint inhibitors for use in other cancers: nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, for Hodgkin lymphoma, and MPDL-3280A, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, for bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Here we review the literature on PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade and focus on the reported clinical studies that have included patients with melanoma. PubMed was searched to identify relevant clinical studies of PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapies in melanoma. A review of data from the current trials on clinicaltrial.gov was incorporated, as well as data presented in abstracts at the 2014 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, given the limited number of published clinical trials on this topic. FINDINGS: The anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents have been reported to have impressive antitumor effects in several malignancies, including melanoma. The greatest clinical activity in unselected patients has been seen in melanoma. Tumor expression of PD-L1 is a suggestive, but inadequate, biomarker predictive of response to immune-checkpoint blockade. However, tumors expressing little or no PD-L1 are less likely to respond to PD-1 pathway blockade. Combination checkpoint blockade with PD-1 plus cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 blockade appears to improve response rates in patients who are less likely to respond to single-checkpoint blockade. Toxicity with PD-1 blocking agents is less than the toxicity with previous immunotherapies (eg, interleukin 2, CTLA-4 blockade). Certain adverse events can be severe and potentially life threatening, but most can be prevented or reversed with close monitoring and appropriate management. IMPLICATIONS: This family of immune-checkpoint inhibitors benefits not only patients with metastatic melanoma but also those with historically less responsive tumor types. Although a subset of patients responds to single-agent blockade, the initial trial of checkpoint-inhibitor combinations has reported a potential to improve response rates. Combination therapies appear to be a means of increasing response rates, albeit with increased immune-related adverse events. As these treatments become available to patients, education regarding the recognition and management of immune-related effects of immune-checkpoint blockade will be essential for maximizing clinical benefit."

EGFR and FGFR1 and MET expression and genetic status were also examined. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was detected in 26.9% and 23.9% of the pulmonary SqCC samples, respectively. PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was maintained or increased in the metastatic lymph node tumors in 81.1% and 93.5% of the 77 cases, respectively. The numbers of PD-1(+) and CD8(+) TILs were significantly positively correlated (P<0.001). Cases displaying high PD-L1 expression exhibited consistently high CD8(+) T cell infiltration (P<0.001), even in subgroup analyses according to age, smoking status, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, stage, and the EGFR, MET and FGFR1 status. Moreover, MET expression in the tumors was significantly correlated with high PD-L2 expression and increased PD-1(+) TILs (P=0.001 for both). Increased numbers of CD8(+) or PD-1(+) TILs were significantly associated with prolonged disease-free survival of these patients,  whereas PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression had no significant prognostic implications. CONCLUSION: PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression in pulmonary SqCC is associated with an increased number of CD8(+) TILs and increased MET expression, which might provide therapeutic insight into targeting the PD-1/PD-Ls pathway in pulmonary SqCC."

The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is of particular interest, in light of promising data demonstrating a restoration of host immunity against tumors, with the prospect of durable remissions. Indeed, remarkable clinical responses have been seen in several different malignancies including, but not limited to, melanoma, lung, kidney, and bladder cancers. Even so, determining which patients derive benefit from PD-1/PD-L1-directed immunotherapy remains an important clinical question, particularly in light of the autoimmune toxicity of  these agents. The use of PD-L1 (B7-H1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a predictive biomarker is confounded by multiple unresolved issues: variable detection antibodies, differing IHC cutoffs, tissue preparation, processing variability, primary versus metastatic biopsies, oncogenic versus induced PD-L1 expression, and staining of tumor versus immune cells. Emerging data suggest that patients whose tumors overexpress PD-L1 by IHC have improved clinical outcomes with anti-PD-1-directed therapy, but the presence of robust responses in some patients with low levels of expression of these markers complicates the issue of PD-L1 as  an exclusionary predictive biomarker. An improved understanding of the host immune system and tumor microenvironment will better elucidate which patients derive benefit from these promising agents."

Radical treatment cannot be introduced in more than 70% of cases and overall survival rate does not exceed 15%. The immunosurveillance of lung cancer may be effective in early oncogenesis  but is inhibited in the course of developing a clinically detectable tumor. Very  low and heterogonous antigenicity of lung cancer cells leads to passive escape from anti-cancer immune defense. The cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) that play a main role in the anticancer response are actively suppressed in the tumor environment and following regulatory mechanisms inhibit the recognition of tumor  antigens by antigen presenting cells. The population of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is augmented and the expression of transcription factor-Foxp3 is markedly increased on tumor cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). It is accomplished by M2 macrophage polarization, the activity of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and a significantly elevated concentration of cytokines: transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and IL-10 in the tumor microenvironment. Very active suppression of immune protection is the predominant role of the programmed death 1 (PD-1)-PD-L1 pathway. The blockage of this pathway was found to be an effective treatment approach; therefore the monoclonal antibodies are being intensively investigated in lung cancer patients. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is the molecule capable of inhibiting the activation signal. The antibody anti-CTLA-4 improves CTLs function in solid tumors and lung cancer patients may benefit from use of this agent. The second way in lung cancer immunotherapy is production of anti-cancer vaccines using recognized cancer antigens: MAGE-A3, membrane associated glycoprotein (MUC-1), and EGF. It was recently shown in ongoing clinical trials that combined therapies: immune- and chemotherapy, radiotherapy or targeted therapy seem to be effective. Immunotherapy in lung cancer has an individual character-there is a need to assess the patient's immune status prior to implementation of immunomodulating therapy."

PD-L1 was analyzed in 77 p with tumor tissue available and was positive  in 20.7% p (14 samples in membrane, 16 in cytoplasm and 4 in immune infiltrate).  PD-L1 intensity was weak in 56.2%, moderate in 25% and strong in 18.7% p. There was a significant relationship between PD-L1 expression and histology (PD-L1 expression 37.5% in no-epithelioid tumor and 13.2% in epithelioid; p=0.033). The  median survival in p PD-L1 positive was 4.79 vs 16.3 months in p PD-L1 negative (p=0.012). We have shown PD-L1 is expressed in 20% of patients, associated with no epithelioid histology and poor prognostic in MPM.

PD-L1 is often expressed in various malignant tumors. In contrast, PD-1 is generally observed in activated lymphocytes and myeloid-derived dendritic cells. Of the malignant cells, only Jurkat cells under special conditions and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma tissue cells express PD-1 on their surface. To clarify whether the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway participates in the immunotolerance of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, we examined the expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 on the cell surface of SCLC cell lines using flow cytometry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Among the four SCLC cell lines examined, only SBC-3 expressed both PD-1  and PD-L1. We demonstrated that both PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules were co-expressed on the surface of SCLC cells. Although the biological implications of this remain unclear, we speculate that PD-1 and its ligand on the SCLC cells may participate  in the growth inhibition of tumor cells as reported in cytotoxic T cells."

Combinations of mAbs to CD137/PD-1/CTLA-4 or CD137/PD-1/CTLA-4/CD19 were administrated intratumorally to mice with syngeneic tumors (B16 and SW1 melanoma, TC1 lung carcinoma), including tumors with a mean surface of approximately 80 mm(2). Survival and tumor growth were assessed. Immunologic responses were evaluated using flow cytometry and qRT-PCR. More than 50% of tumor-bearing mice had complete regression and long-term survival after tumor injection with mAbs recognizing CD137/PD-1/CTLA-4/CD19 with similar responses in three models. Intratumoral injection was more efficacious than intraperitoneal injection in causing rejection also of untreated tumors in the same mice. The three-mAb combination could also induce regression, but was less efficacious. There were few side effects, and therapy-resistant tumors were not observed. Transplanted tumor cells rapidly caused a Th2 response with increased CD19 cells. Successful therapy shifted this response to the Th1 phenotype with decreased CD19 cells and increased numbers of long-term memory CD8 effector cells and T cells making IFNγ  and TNFα. Intratumoral injection of mAbs recognizing CD137/PD-1/CTLA-4/CD19 can eradicate established tumors and reverse a Th2 response with tumor-associated CD19 cells to Th1 immunity, whereas a combination lacking anti-CD19 is less effective. There are several human cancers for which a similar approach may provide clinical benefit."

Since then, many tumour-targeted monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of cancers. Compared to conventional chemotherapies, these new drugs have more specificity against cancer cells and less systemic toxicities. However, like conventional chemotherapies, they often provide limited therapeutic benefits with short-lasting tumour responses as the vast majority of cancers become resistant to these drugs over time. Therefore, tumour-targeted therapies are an incremental innovation as compared to historical chemotherapies. Recently, a paradigm shift has been brought to the clinic with drugs targeting immune cells rather than cancer cells with the aim of stimulating the anti-tumour immune response of patients against their own cancer. Immunomodulatory drugs such as anti-CTLA4 and  anti-PD-1 have generated long-lasting tumour responses when used as single agent  in patients with refractory/relapsing cancers such as metastatic melanomas, renal cell carcinoma or non-small-cell lung carcinoma. These new immune-targeted therapies are therefore a disruptive innovation in cancer treatment: they demonstrate that long-lasting clinical benefits could be obtained by targeting molecules involved in the immune tolerance of cancer cells rather than by targeting oncogenic drivers or antigens expressed by cancer cells."

Aberrant PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression may cause local immune-suppression. Here we investigated expression of PD-1 and its ligands by immunohistochemistry and RNA-seq in small cell carcinomas. PD-L1 and PD-1 protein expression were analysed in 94 clinical cases of small cell carcinomas (61 pulmonary, 33 extrapulmonary) by immunohistochemistry using two different monoclonal antibodies (5H1, E1L3N). RNA expression was profiled by RNA-seq in 43 clinical cases. None of the small cell carcinomas showed PD-L1 protein expression in tumour cells. PD-L1 and PD-1 expression was noticed in the stroma: Using immunohistochemistry, 18.5% of cases  (17/92) showed PD-L1 expression in tumour-infiltrating macrophages and 48% showed PD-1 positive lymphocytes (45/94). RNA-seq showed moderate PD-L1 gene expression  in 37.2% (16/43). PD-L1 was correlated with macrophage and T-cell markers. The second PD-1 ligand PD-L2 was expressed in 27.9% (12/43) and showed similar correlations. Thus, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway seems activated in a fraction of small cell carcinomas. The carcinoma cells were negative in all cases, PD-L1 was expressed in tumour-infiltrating macrophages and was correlated with tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.

Although surgery plays a  role for some patients, the majority of fit patients will be treated with chemotherapy and radiation alone. The optimal therapy for all patients remains undefined, but certain principles of care are widely accepted. Specifically, concurrent chemoradiation is the standard of care for patients who are able to tolerate such therapy, namely those with a good performance status, minimal or no weight loss, and adequate end-organ function, including pulmonary reserve. The most commonly used chemotherapy regimens given in combination with radiation therapy are cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/paclitaxel. Studies incorporating  newer agents have not improved outcomes when compared to these older regimens. The merits of chemotherapy administered beyond the conclusion of radiation therapy continue to be debated, but thus far randomized phase III trials have not provided supporting evidence for this strategy. Incorporating antiangiogenics with chemoradiation has proven to be ineffective in some cases and unsafe in others. Studies with targeted agents in unselected patient populations with stage III disease have also been disappointing. Despite these recent setbacks, however, there remains a sound rationale for incorporating molecularly targeted agents into chemoradiation regimens in select patient groups or consolidating chemoradiation with immunotherapy.

Ipilimumab, an antibody targeting CTLA-4, appears to restore tumor immunity at the priming phase, whereas anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies restore immune function in the tumor microenvironment. Although ipilimumab can produce durable long-term responses in patients with advanced melanoma, it is associated with significant immune-related toxicities. By contrast, antibodies targeting either PD-1 or PD-L1 have produced significant  anti-tumor activity with considerably less toxicity. Activity was seen in patients with melanoma and renal cancer, as well as those with non-small-cell lung, bladder and head and neck cancers, tumors not previously felt to be sensitive to immunotherapy. The tolerability of PD-1-pathway blockers and their unique mechanism of action have made them ideal backbones for combination regimen development.

Indeed, as opposed to tumor-targeted therapies, it is now clear that immune-targeted therapies designed to enhance the antitumor  immune response are a relevant strategy to obtain long-term tumor responses. Interestingly, the study of tumor cell death biology has recently revealed that part of radiotherapy efficacy relies on its ability to trigger an immune response against tumor cells. This immunogenic cell death partly relies on the generation of damage-associated molecular patterns, which can stimulate immune sensors such as toll-like receptors. Tumor radiation therapy can therefore be envisioned as a strategy to perform an in situ immunization because it can initiate the release of tumor-associated antigens, deplete immune suppressors, and stimulate antigen-presenting cells via endogenous release of toll-like receptor agonists. Moreover, combinations of radiotherapy with immune checkpoint  antibodies are synergistic in preclinical models.

Understanding the different mechanisms of action, safety profiles, and response patterns associated with inhibition of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways may improve patient management as these therapies are moved in to the clinical practice setting and may also provide a rationale for combination therapy with different inhibitors. Additional immune checkpoint molecules with therapeutic potential, including lymphocyte activation gene-3 and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related gene, also have inhibitors in early stages of clinical development. Clinical responses and safety data reported to date on immune checkpoint inhibitors suggest these agents may have the potential to markedly improve outcomes for patients with cancer."

Inhibiting the interactions of the immune function mediates the antitumor activity in preclinical models. The programmed death 1 (PD-1) gene -606 G/A polymorphism, which may modify promoter activity and is Asian-specific, was investigated by TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay in surgically treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. In the present study, 583 surgically removed NSCLC cases were included for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses. The PD-1 SNP statuses at the promoter region (rs36084323) were 146 AA (25.0%), 293 GA (50.3%) and 144 GG (24.7%). The ratio was extremely similar to the healthy control in a previous study: 24.9% AA, 47.8% GA and 27.3%  GG. The ratio of the GG phenotype was not significantly different for gender (25.1% males and 23.9% female), age (25.2% ≤65 years and 24.4% >65 years), smoking status (26.1% smoker and 21.8% non-smoker) and pathological subtypes [25.4% adenocarcinoma (adeno) and 24.2% squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)]. The GG ratio of PD-1 was not significantly different between pathological stage II-IV (25.5%) and stage I cases (24.1%; P=0.6245). The survival time of the patients with the -606 GG phenotype of PD-1 was significantly lower (n=147, 50 succumbed)  compared to the patients with -606 GA or -606 AA (n=435, 109 succumbed) (P=0.0183). The GG phenotype patients had a significantly worse prognosis in the  SCC population (P=0.009), however, this was not different to the adeno population (P=0.2594). Thus, PD-1 may promote tumor prognosis and provide a candidate for the blockade of its function as a strategy to antagonize the progression process  in NSCLC, particularly lung SCC."

In this study, we validated mRNA encoding soluble factors as a tool  to modulate the tumor microenvironment to potentiate infiltration of tumor-specific T cells. Intratumoral delivery of mRNA encoding a fusion protein consisting of interferon-β and the ectodomain of the transforming growth factor-β receptor II, referred to as Fβ², showed therapeutic potential. The treatment efficacy was dependent on CD8⁺ T cells and could be improved through blockade of  PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. In vitro studies revealed that administration of Fβ² to  tumor cells resulted in a reduced proliferation and increased expression of MHC I but also PD-L1. Importantly, Fβ² enhanced the antigen presenting capacity of dendritic cells, whilst reducing the suppressive activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In conclusion, these data suggest that intratumoral delivery of mRNA encoding soluble proteins, such as Fβ², can modulate the tumor microenvironment, leading to effective antitumor T cell responses, which can be further potentiated through combination therapy."

However, the relationship between PD-1 expression in peripheral blood T-cells and prognosis after treatment with a cancer vaccine has not been reported. To elucidate this relationship, we analyzed PD-1 expression in the peripheral blood T-cells of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The blood samples used in this study were obtained from patients enrolled in phase II clinical trials of a personalized peptide vaccine. Seventy-eight samples obtained before and after a single vaccination cycle (consisting of six or eight doses) were subjected to the analysis. PD-1 was expressed on lymphocytes in the majority of samples. The relative contents of PD1(+) CD4(+) T-cells against total lymphocytes before and after the vaccination cycle correlated with  overall survival (OS) with a high degree of statistical significance (P < 0.0001  and P = 0.0014). A decrease in PD-1(+) CD8(+) T-cells after one cycle of vaccination also correlated with longer OS (P = 0.032). The IgG response to the non-vaccinated peptides suggested that the epitope spreading seemed to occur more frequently in high-PD-1(+) CD4(+) T-cell groups. Enrichment of CD45RA(-) CCR7(-)  effector-memory phenotype cells in PD-1(+) T-cells in PBMCs was also shown. These results suggest that PD-1 expression on the peripheral blood T-cell subsets can become a new prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with personalized peptide vaccination."

Identifying factors predicting clinical response could guide patient selection and therapeutic optimization. Patients (N = 41) with melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), colorectal carcinoma, or castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated on an early-phase trial of anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) at one institution and had evaluable pretreatment tumor specimens. Immunoarchitectural features, including PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 expression, patterns of immune cell infiltration, and lymphocyte subpopulations,  were assessed for interrelationships and potential correlations with clinical outcomes. Membranous (cell surface) PD-L1 expression by tumor cells and immune infiltrates varied significantly by tumor type and was most abundant in melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC. In the overall cohort, PD-L1 expression was geographically associated with infiltrating immune cells (P < 0.001), although lymphocyte-rich regions were not always associated with PD-L1 expression. Expression of PD-L1 by  tumor cells and immune infiltrates was significantly associated with expression of PD-1 on lymphocytes. PD-L2, the second ligand for PD-1, was associated with PD-L1 expression. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression correlated with objective response  to anti-PD-1 therapy, when analyzing either the specimen obtained closest to therapy or the highest scoring sample among multiple biopsies from individual patients. These correlations were stronger than borderline associations of PD-1 expression or the presence of intratumoral immune cell infiltrates with response. Tumor PD-L1 expression reflects an immune-active microenvironment and, while associated other immunosuppressive molecules, including PD-1 and PD-L2, is the single factor most closely correlated with response to anti-PD-1 blockade."

Normalized T-cell function is an important contributor to spontaneous resolution of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Up-regulation of inhibitor receptors, such as programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1, are important inhibitors of T-cell function. To determine the effects of PD-1 pathway blockade on sarcoidosis CD4(+) T-cell proliferative capacity. Gene expression profiles of sarcoidosis and healthy control peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed at baseline and follow-up. Flow cytometry was used to measure ex vivo expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on systemic and bronchoalveolar lavage-derived cells of subjects with sarcoidosis and control subjects, as well as the effects of PD-1 pathway blockade on cellular proliferation after T-cell receptor stimulation. Immunohistochemistry analysis for PD-1/PD-L1 expression was conducted on sarcoidosis, malignant, and healthy control lung specimens. Microarray analysis demonstrates longitudinal increase in PDCD1 gene expression in sarcoidosis peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed increased PD-L1 expression within sarcoidosis granulomas and lung malignancy, but this was absent in healthy lungs. Increased numbers of sarcoidosis PD-1(+) CD4(+) T cells are present systemically, compared with healthy control subjects (P < 0.0001). Lymphocytes with reduced proliferative capacity exhibited increased proliferation with PD-1 pathway blockade. Longitudinal analysis of subjects with sarcoidosis revealed reduced PD-1(+) CD4(+) T cells with spontaneous clinical resolution but not with disease  progression. Analogous to the effects in other chronic lung diseases, these findings demonstrate that the PD-1 pathway is an important contributor to sarcoidosis CD4(+) T-cell proliferative capacity and clinical outcome. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway may be a viable therapeutic target to optimize clinical outcomes."

We have learned over the last decade that powerful immunologic effector cells may be blocked by inhibitory regulatory pathways controlled by specific molecules often called immune checkpoints. These checkpoints serve to control or turn off the immune response when it is no  longer needed to prevent tissue injury and autoimmunity. Cancer cells have learned or evolved to use these mechanisms to evade immune control and elimination. The development of a new therapeutic class of drugs that inhibit these inhibitory pathways has recently emerged as a potent strategy in oncology.  Three sets of agents have emerged in clinical trials exploiting this strategy. These agents are antibody-based therapies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). These inhibitors of immune inhibition have demonstrated extensive activity as single agents and in combinations. Clinical responses have  been seen in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and several other tumor types. Despite the autoimmune or inflammatory immune-mediated adverse effects which have been seen, the responses and overall survival benefits exhibited thus far warrant further clinical development."

Studies have shown that platelets, from precursor megakaryocytes, are significant factors in cancer prognosis, cancer progression,  and metastasis; but a direct platelet-cancer relationship remains unclear. CTL play an essential role in cancer surveillance by inducing cancer cell death with  granzyme B. A recent report has shown the presence of binding targets with binding affinity to a synthetic granzyme B-like peptide fluorescent conjugate (GP1R) in different types of cancer cells grown in vitro. It suggests that these  binding targets may serve as a universal-pathologic-biomarker. It is not known  if similar biomarkers may be present in platelets of cancer patients. We show with fluoroscopic images that GP1R can bind to binding targets: 1) within platelets in methanol-fixed whole blood smears of patients with breast cancer and lung cancer, and 2) within platelet-like structures in formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nude mouse xenogeneic breast tumor tissues. Samples without cancer-association displayed no discernible GP1R-binding in platelet-like structures. Our data demonstrate for the first time that a similar universal-pathologic-biomarker detectable by GP1R-binding is present in circulating platelets of cancer patients. The data depict a co-existence of animal-platelets and human-breast cancer cells, both have a common pathologic biomarker detectable by GP1R, in the tumor growth. The fluoroscopic images indicate a visual direct connection between pathologic platelets and cancer. These preliminary results may lead to developments of novel platelet-based cancer diagnostics and therapeutics and a better understanding of the potential multifunction of GP1R and its relationship to megakaryocytes and PD1."

This combination significantly reduces metastatic burden and prolongs the life of mice compared with either monotherapy alone. Importantly, the combination was only effective when the tumor expressed high levels of CD73, suggesting a tumor biomarker that at a minimum could be used to stratify patients that might receive this combination. The mechanism of the combination therapy was critically dependent on NK cells and IFNγ, and to a lesser extent, CD8(+) T cells and the effector molecule, perforin.

Across human osteosarcoma samples, PDL1 mRNA gene expression ranged over 4 log (>5,000-fold difference). Relative expression levels were evaluated against clinical factors such as age/gender, metastasis, recurrence, chemotherapy, percentage of necrosis, and survival; no significant associations were identified. The presence of TILs was associated with high PDL1 expression (R(2) = 0.37; P = 0.01).

Tumor PD-L1 protein expression may predict response to drugs targeting this pathway. Measurement of PD-L1 protein is limited by the lack of standardized immunohistochemical methods and variable performance  of antibodies. Our goal was to correlate PD-L1 mRNA expression with clinical variables in primary breast carcinomas. The fluorescent RNAscope paired-primer assay was used to quantify in situ PD-L1 mRNA levels in 636 stage I-III breast carcinomas on two sets of tissue microarrays [YTMA128 (n = 238) and YTMA201 (n = 398)]. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were assessed by hematoxylin/eosin stain and quantitative fluorescence. On YTMA128 and YTMA201, 55.7% and 59.5% of cases showed PD-L1 mRNA expression, respectively. Higher PD-L1 mRNA expression was significantly associated with increased TILs (P = 0.04) but not with other clinical variables.  Elevated TILs (scores 2 and 3+) occurred in 16.5% on YTMA128 and 14.8% on YTMA201 and was associated with estrogen receptor-negative status (P = 0.01 on YTMA128 and 0.0001 on YTMA201). PD-L1 mRNA expression was associated with longer recurrence-free survival (log-rank P = 0.01), which remained significant in multivariate analysis including age, tumor size, histologic grade, nodal metastasis, hormone receptor, HER2 status, and the extent of TILs (HR, 0.268; CI, 0.099-0.721; P = 0.009).

Blockade of the RGMb-PD-L2 interaction markedly impaired the development of respiratory tolerance by interfering with the initial T cell expansion required for respiratory tolerance. Experiments with PD-L2-deficient mice showed that PD-L2 expression on non-T cells was critical for respiratory tolerance, but expression on T cells was not required. Because PD-L2 binds to both PD-1, which inhibits antitumor immunity, and to RGMb, which regulates respiratory immunity, targeting the PD-L2 pathway has therapeutic potential for asthma, cancer, and other immune-mediated disorders. Understanding this pathway may provide insights into how to optimally  modulate the PD-1 pathway in cancer immunotherapy while minimizing adverse events."

Therapies targeting  the immune checkpoint molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1 have achieved objective responses in melanoma, renal cancer, and lung cancer; however, a large number of patients are still suffering with these cancers that are not benefiting from these therapies. Moreover, several cancers have proved to be largely refractory to therapies that target CTLA-4 and PD-1. This has catalyzed interest in targeting novel immune checkpoint receptors with the goal of realizing the full potential of checkpoint blockade for treating cancer.

PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry in 143 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas and was correlated with clinical variables, histologic subtypes, and the mutational status of EGFR, KRAS, HER2, and ALK. Positive PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with more advanced T status, N status, and pathologic stage. Histologically, lung adenocarcinomas with positive PD-L1 staining were less likely to be adenocarcinoma in situ or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma and more likely to have solid predominant subtype. Both PD-L1 expression (odds ratio =1.984, 95% confidence interval =1.010-3.894; P=0.047) and PD-L2 expression (odds ratio =2.328, 95% confidence interval =1.201-4.512; P=0.012) were independent predictors of poor overall survival. When the combined PD-L expression and pathologic stage were used together to predict overall survival, the concordance  index increased to 0.763, and the Akaike information criteria value decreased to  356.08. CONCLUSION: We defined the clinicopathologic features of lung adenocarcinomas with high expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2.

PD-1/PD-1 ligand blocking antibodies can reverse the inhibition and show significant therapeutic promise in treating renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lung cancer, and melanoma. While PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been associated with poor outcome in RCC, we sought to define immune cell biomarkers, including PD-1, on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that could predict disease progression of RCC patients before and after nephrectomy. We analyzed expression of numerous immune cell markers on fresh PBMCs from 90 RCC patients preoperatively and 25 age-matched healthy controls by 10-color flow cytometry. Postoperative blood samples were also analyzed from 23 members of the RCC patient cohort. The most striking phenotypic immune biomarker in RCC patients was a significant increase in PD-1 expression on certain PBMCs in a subset of patients. Increased PD-1 expression on CD14(bright) myelomonocytic cells, effector T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells correlated to disease stage, and expression was significantly reduced on all cell types soon after surgical resection of the primary tumor. The results indicate that PD-1 expression on fresh peripheral blood leukocytes may provide a  useful indicator of RCC disease progression. Furthermore, measuring PD-1 levels in peripheral blood may assist in identifying patients likely to respond to PD-1  blocking antibodies, and these therapies may be most effective before and immediately after surgical resection of the primary tumor, when PD-1 expression is most prominent."

In order to examine the role of virus-specific CD8 T cells against Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), we generated a comprehensive panel of potential epitopes predicted in silico and screened for T cell responses in healthy VZV seropositive donors. We identified a dominant HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope in the VZV ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2 and used a tetramer to analyze the phenotype and function of epitope-specific CD8 T cells. Interestingly, CD8 T cells responding to this VZV epitope also recognized homologous epitopes, not only in the other α-herpesviruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, but also the γ-herpesvirus, EBV. Responses against these epitopes did not depend on previous infection with the originating  virus, thus indicating the cross-reactive nature of this T cell population. Between individuals, the cells demonstrated marked phenotypic heterogeneity. This was associated with differences in functional capacity related to increased inhibitory receptor expression (including PD-1) along with decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules that potentially reflected their stimulation history. Vaccination with the live attenuated Zostavax vaccine did not efficiently stimulate a proliferative response in this epitope-specific population. Thus, we  identified a human CD8 T cell epitope that is conserved in four clinically important herpesviruses but that was poorly boosted by the current adult VZV vaccine. We discuss the concept of a pan-herpesvirus vaccine that this discovery raises and the hurdles that may need to be overcome in order to achieve this."

We observed decreased CTLs and increased markers of T-cell exhaustion in mouse models of EGFR-driven lung cancer.

The expression level of CD3⁺CD8⁺ T cells in the lung cancer patients was (38.83 ± 1.74)%, significantly lower than that in the control group [(43.25 ± 3.35)%, P < 0.05]. CD8⁺CD28⁺ T cell subset in the peripheral blood of lung cancer patients was (17.73 ± 1.21)% significantly lower than that of the healthy donors  [(27.96 ± 2.72)%, P < 0.01]. The CD8⁺CD28⁻ T cell subset was (21.19 ± 1.92)% in the lung cancer patients, significantly higher than that of the healthy control group [(15.18 ± 2.93)%, P < 0.05]. The expression level of PD-1 on the surface of CD8⁺CD28⁺ T cells was (10.67 ± 1.12)% in the group of lung cancer patients, significantly higher than that of the control group [(5.32 ± 1.58)%, P < 0.01]. It was also found that the expression of PD-1 on CD8⁺CD28⁻ T cells was up-regulated in the group of lung cancer patients (7.46 ± 1.25)%, significantly higher than that of the healthy control group [(2.68+1.07)%, P < 0.01]. The expression level of PD-L1 on CD68⁺ cells in the lung cancer patients was (16.03 ± 2.06)%, significantly higher than that of the healthy control group [(9.32 ± 2.00)%, P < 0.05]. CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of PD-1/PD-L1 on peripheral blood cells in lung cancer  patients negatively regulates the lymphocytes, inhibits the immune response for killing tumor cells, and promotes tumor development and immune escape."

Oncotarget. 2013 Nov;4(11):2067-79.","Alterations of immune response of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Azacytidine.","Innovative therapies are needed for advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).  We have undertaken a genomics based, hypothesis driving, approach to query an emerging potential that epigenetic therapy may sensitize to immune checkpoint therapy targeting PD-L1/PD-1 interaction. NSCLC cell lines were treated with the  DNA hypomethylating agent azacytidine (AZA - Vidaza) and genes and pathways altered were mapped by genome-wide expression and DNA methylation analyses. AZA-induced pathways were analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project by mapping the derived gene signatures in hundreds of lung adeno (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) samples. AZA up-regulates genes and pathways related to both innate and adaptive immunity and genes related to immune evasion in a several NSCLC lines. DNA hypermethylation and low expression of IRF7, an interferon transcription factor, tracks with this signature particularly in LUSC. In concert with these events, AZA up-regulates PD-L1 transcripts and protein, a key ligand-mediator of immune tolerance. Analysis of TCGA samples demonstrates that a significant proportion of primary NSCLC have low expression of AZA-induced immune genes, including PD-L1. We hypothesize that epigenetic therapy combined with blockade of immune checkpoints - in particular the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway - may  augment response of NSCLC by shifting the balance between immune activation and immune inhibition, particularly in a subset of NSCLC with low expression of these pathways. Our studies define a biomarker strategy for response in a recently initiated trial to examine the potential of epigenetic therapy to sensitize patients with NSCLC to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade."

Recent success of checkpoint blockade in highly immunogenic tumors has renewed interest in immunotherapy. Regulatory T (T reg) cells densely  populate solid tumors, which may promote progression through suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. We investigated the role of T reg cells in murine mammary carcinogenesis using an orthotopic, polyoma middle-T antigen-driven model in Foxp3(DTR) knockin mice. T reg cell ablation resulted in significant determent of primary and metastatic tumor progression. Importantly, short-term ablation of  T reg cells in advanced spontaneous tumors led to extensive apoptotic tumor cell  death. This anti-tumor activity was dependent on IFN-γ and CD4(+) T cells but not on NK or CD8(+) T cells. Combination of T reg cell ablation with CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 blockade did not affect tumor growth or improve the therapeutic effect attained by T reg cell ablation alone. However, T reg cell targeting jointly with tumor irradiation significantly reduced tumor burden and improved overall survival. Together, our results demonstrate a major tumor-promoting role of T reg cells in an autochthonous model of tumorigenesis, and they reveal the potential therapeutic value of combining transient T reg cell ablation with radiotherapy for the management of poorly immunogenic, aggressive malignancies."

Recently, much attention has been devoted to the blockade of PD-1 signaling to activate an  immune response to cancer. PD-1, a protein expressed on T cells, is a member of the CD28 superfamily, and it transmits coinhibitory signals upon engagement with  its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Accumulating evidence suggests that the PD-1 system  plays pivotal roles in the regulation of autoimmunity, transplantation immunity,  infectious immunity, and tumor immunity. Because the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands occurs in the effector phase of killer T cell responses in peripheral blood, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies are ideal as specific agents to augment T cell responses to tumors with fewer adverse events than with  the inhibition of CTLA-4, because the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands occurs in the priming phase of T cell responses within lymph nodes. In recent phase I clinical trials, objective responses were observed in patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer who underwent immunotherapy with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. In addition, the antitumor activity of an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody was observed in patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer. The next frontier of immunotherapy targeting the PD-1 axis is to define patient selection criteria and explore combination therapy with other therapeutic manipulations such as adoptive immunotherapies."

However, α-GalCer induces strong, long-lasting anergy of iNKT cells, which could  be a major detriment for clinical therapy. A novel iNKT cell agonist, β-mannosylceramide (β-ManCer), induces strong antitumor immunity through a mechanism distinct from that of α-GalCer. The objective of this study was to determine whether β-ManCer induces anergy of iNKT cells. Induction of anergy was determined by ex vivo analysis of splenocytes from mice pretreated with iNKT cell agonists as well as in the CT26 lung metastasis in vivo tumor model. β-ManCer activated iNKT cells without inducing long-term anergy. The transience of anergy induction correlated with a shortened duration of PD-1 upregulation on iNKT cells activated with β-ManCer, compared with α-GalCer. Moreover, whereas mice pretreated with α-GalCer were unable to respond to a second glycolipid stimulation to induce tumor protection for up to 2 months, mice pretreated with β-ManCer were protected from tumors by a second stimulation equivalently to vehicle-treated mice. The lack of long-term functional anergy induced by β-ManCer, which allows for a second dose to still give therapeutic benefit, suggests the strong potential for this iNKT cell agonist to succeed in settings where α-GalCer has failed."

Costimulation by individual members of the immunoglobulin-like (Ig)- and TNF superfamily have already shown promising antitumor potential, thus  prompting the exploration of their synergistic abilities in combinatorial approaches. Here, we pursued a targeted strategy with antibody-fusion proteins composed of a tumor-directed antibody and the extracellular domain of the costimulatory ligand B7.1, 4-1BBL, OX40L, GITRL or LIGHT, respectively. Costimulatory activity was assessed in an experimental setting where initial T cell activation was induced by a bispecific antibody (tumor-related antigen × CD3). Advantage of combined targeted costimulation was shown for either B7.1 or 4-1BBL with OX40L, GITRL, LIGHT and 4-1BBL in terms of T cell proliferation and IFN-γ release. Since encouraging results were obtained by the combination of B7.1 and 4-1BBL, we adapted the model system for a time-shift setting. Here, enhanced  proliferation and granzyme B expression as well as reduced PD-1 expression on the T cell population demonstrated the benefit of costimulation-assisted restimulation. Finally, the antitumor potential of this combinatorial setting was confirmed in vivo in a lung metastasis mouse model. Thus, combinatorial approaches with costimulatory antibody-ligand fusion proteins seem a promising strategy to be further investigated for cancer immunotherapy."

Silica-induced lung inflammation increased the incidence and multiplicity of lung cancer in mice treated with N-nitrosodimethylamine, a carcinogen found in tobacco smoke. Histologic and molecular analysis revealed that concomitant chronic inflammation contributed to  lung tumorigenesis through induction of preneoplastic changes in lung epithelial  cells. In addition, silica-mediated inflammation generated an immunosuppressive microenvironment in which we observed increased expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), transforming growth factor-β1, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), as well as the presence of regulatory T cells.

Preclinical data suggest that pre-existing tumor immunity is important for disease regression upon checkpoint blockade-based therapies. However, the nature of antigen-specific T-cell responses that correlate with the clinical response to immunotherapy in NSCLC patients is not known. The embryonic stem cell gene SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) has recently emerged as a major oncogenic driver in NSCLC. Here, we show that nearly 50% of a cohort of NSCLC patients mounted both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against SOX2, which could be readily detected among peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T-cell responses against SOX2 were associated with NSCLC regression upon immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, whereas none  of the patients lacking SOX2-specific T cells experienced disease regression following immune checkpoint blockade. Conversely, cellular and humoral responses  against viral antigens or another tumor-associated antigen (NY-ESO-1) failed to correlate with the clinical response of NSCLC patients to immunotherapy. Of note, the administration of PD-1-blocking antibodies was associated with intramolecular epitope spread as well as with the amplification of SOX2-specific immune responses in vivo. These findings identify SOX2 as an important tumor-associated  antigen in NSCLC and link the presence of SOX2-specific T cells with the clinical response of lung cancer patients to immunotherapy."

Rationale for the development of PD-1 pathway-targeted therapies and associated clinical data are presented. Finally, efforts to date to identify and develop partner predictive or prognostic biomarkers for these new PD-1 pathway-targeted immunotherapies are discussed. Rather than targeting the tumor directly, immunotherapies inhibiting PD-1 pathway signaling modulate the antitumor immune response. Indeed, these agents have already demonstrated promising antitumor activity and manageable toxicity in various cancers. If future data continue to support encouraging clinical profiles of anti-PD-1 and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibodies, the current paradigm of cancer therapy may shift.

In this study, we tested whether treatment with a VIP receptor antagonistic peptide protects C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice from mCMV-infection. One week of daily subcutaneous injections of VIPhyb was non-toxic and did not alter frequencies of immune cell subsets in non-infected mice. VIPhyb administration to mCMV-infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice markedly enhanced survival, viral clearance, and reduced liver and lung pathology compared with saline-treated controls. The numbers of effector/memory CD8+ T-cells and mature NK cells were increased in VIPhyb-treated mice compared with PBS-treated groups. Pharmacological blockade of VIP-receptor binding or genetic blockade of VIP-signaling prevented the up-regulation of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression on DC and activated CD8+ T-cells, respectively, in mCMV-infected mice, and enhanced CD80, CD86, and MHC-II expression on conventional and plasmacytoid DC. VIPhyb-treatment increased type-I IFN synthesis, numbers of IFN-γ- and TNF-α-expressing NK cells and T-cells, and the numbers of mCMV-M45 epitope-peptide-MHC-I tetramer CD8+ T-cells following mCMV infection. VIP-treatment lowered the percentage of Treg cells in spleens compared with PBS-treated WT mice following mCMV infection, while significantly decreasing levels of serum VEGF induced by mCMV-infection. The mice in all treated groups exhibited similar levels of anti-mCMV antibody titers. Short-term administration  of a VIP-receptor antagonist represents a novel approach to enhance innate and adaptive cellular immunity in a murine model of CMV infection."

A phase I study of nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, has suggested that this agent is also active against squamous and non-squamous NSCLC. Ongoing phase III studies are evaluating the therapeutic potential of these agents.

Recently, B7-H1 expression by pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues  has been identified as a potential prognostic marker. Additionally, blockade of B7-H1 in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer has been shown to produce an anti-tumor response. These data suggest the importance of B7-H1 as a potential therapeutic target. Anti-B7-H1 blockade antibodies are therefore being tested in  clinical trials for multiple human solid tumors including melanoma and cancers of lung, colon, kidney, stomach and pancreas. In order to eventually be able to identify the patients who will benefit from B7-H1 targeting therapies, it is critical to investigate the correlation between expression and localization of B7-H1 and patient response to treatment with B7-H1 blockade antibodies. Examining the expression of B7-H1 in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues through immunohistochemistry will give a better understanding of how this co-inhibitory signaling molecule contributes to the suppression of antitumor immunity in the tumor's microenvironment. The anti-B7-H1 monoclonal antibody (clone 5H1) developed by Chen and coworkers has been shown to produce reliable staining results in cryosections of multiple types of human neoplastic tissues, but staining on paraffin-embedded slides had been a challenge until recently. We have developed the B7-H1 staining protocol for paraffin-embedded slides of pancreatic  adenocarcinoma tissues. The B7-H1 staining protocol described here produces consistent membranous and cytoplasmic staining of B7-H1 with little background."

As responses were observed in smaller numbers in phase I trials, the immunologic profiles and unique toxicities of these agents have not been fully established in NSCLC. Moreover, PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in development by different companies may demonstrate diverse spectrums of activity  and toxicity. Although the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) checkpoint inhibitors in earlier phase studies appeared to have less impressive responses in NSCLC, their safety profile has been more broadly defined. The anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab, has the best characterized immune-related toxicities (predominantly skin, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and endocrine) and management strategies in melanoma. Despite the lack of studies directly comparing these agents, toxicities from PD-1 inhibition seem milder than those of CTLA-4 inhibition, with distinct toxicities of pneumonitis infrequently observed with the BMS-936558 anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumamb, and frequent mild infusion reactions reported with the BMS-936559 anti-PDL-1 antibody. As lungs are critical organs often already compromised in NSCLC patients, immune-mediated pneumonitis can cause worrisome morbidity and mortality. Even though immune checkpoint inhibitors are being rapidly developed in a multitude of trials, optimal immune-mediated toxicity management has not been determined, is evolving, and will be further explored. Early diagnosis and symptom management with corticosteroids form the basis of treatment. Assessment of new immune-response criteria and use of primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) will be important  in the development of these immunotherapies in NSCLC."

New approaches are needed to improve overall survival beyond the current standard of care. This review discusses recent clinical trials using immunotherapy techniques to treat both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and highlights ongoing immunotherapy research efforts at our center. For NSCLC, phase II clinical trials have examined allogeneic vaccines that target either mucin 1 (MUC1), epidermal growth factor or melanoma-associated antigen 3. These vaccines are now undergoing larger phase III trials. An autologous cellular therapy directed against transforming growth factor beta-2 and a recombinant protein with antitumor properties have also shown promise in prolonging survival in NSCLC in phase II trials. The monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab, BMS-936558 (anti-PD-1), and BMS936559 (anti-PD-L1) lead to enhanced T-cell-mediated antitumor effects and have produced objective responses in early-phase clinical trials. Studies for SCLC also exist, such as a novel vaccine therapy targeting p53. Recent clinical trials in lung cancer demonstrate the potential of immunotherapeutics to increase overall survival in patients with lung cancer compared with the current standard of care."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a promising target for the next generation of immune-based strategies. In this article, we examine the current state of the art in lung cancer immunotherapy, including vaccines that specifically target lung tumor antigens and immune checkpoint antibodies such as antiprogrammed death 1 (anti-PD-1). Both approaches harness innate immunity against tumors by suppressing tumor-induced immune paresis. Methods. To identify relevant clinical trials of immunotherapy in NSCLC, PubMed and Medline databases were searched using the terms immunotherapy and NSCLC, and several other therapy-specific search terms (e.g., PD-1, NSCLC). Additionally, abstracts presented at international lung cancer symposia, the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, and the European Society of Medical Oncology annual meeting between 2005 and 2013 were evaluated. Results. Large international phase III trials of NSCLC vaccines have completed accrual in  both the adjuvant and metastatic disease settings. Results of the START study were disappointing, but results from other studies are still awaited. Immune checkpoint modulation has shown promise, with separate phase I studies of the anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, and anti-PD-L1 antibody, MPDL3280A, demonstrating  good tolerance and durable responses for certain patients with NSCLC who were heavily pretreated. Immune-based strategies have shown initial promise for early- and advanced-stage NSCLC. Validating these findings in randomized studies and discovering durable biomarkers of response represent the next challenges for investigation."

In this study, we investigated the capacity of lung cancer cells to activate complement and characterized the consequences of complement activation on tumor progression. We focused our study on the production and role  of the anaphylatoxin C5a, a potent immune mediator generated after complement activation. We first measured the capacity of lung cancer cell lines to deposit C5 and release C5a. C5 deposition, after incubation with normal human serum, was  higher in lung cancer cell lines than in nonmalignant bronchial epithelial cells. Notably, lung malignant cells produced complement C5a even in the absence of serum. We also found a significant increase of C5a in plasma from patients with non-small cell lung cancer, suggesting that the local production of C5a is followed by its systemic diffusion. The contribution of C5a to lung cancer growth in vivo was evaluated in the Lewis lung cancer model. Syngeneic tumors of 3LL cells grew slower in mice treated with an antagonist of the C5a receptor. C5a did not modify 3LL cell proliferation in vitro but induced endothelial cell chemotaxis and blood-vessels formation. C5a also contributed to the immunosuppressive microenvironment required for tumor growth. In particular, blockade of C5a receptor significantly reduced myeloid-derived suppressor cells and immunomodulators ARG1, CTLA-4, IL-6, IL-10, LAG3, and PDL1 (B7H1). In conclusion, lung cancer cells have the capacity to generate C5a, a molecule that  creates a favorable tumor microenvironment for lung cancer progression."

Studies from cancer and  chronic infections reveal that B7-H1 (PD-L1) engagement with its receptor PD-1 promotes apoptosis of effector T cells. It is not clear how B7-H1 regulates T‑cell apoptosis and the subsequent impact of B7-H1 on the generation of memory T cells. In immunized B7-H1-deficient mice, we detected an increased expansion of effector CD8(+) T cells and a delayed T‑cell contraction followed by the emergence of a protective CD8(+) T‑cell memory capable of completely rejecting tumor metastases in the lung. Intracellular staining revealed that antigen-primed CD8(+) T cells in B7-H1-deficient mice express lower levels of the pro-apoptotic  molecule Bim. The engagement of activated CD8(+) T cells by a plate-bound B7-H1 fusion protein led to the upregulation of Bim and increased cell death. Assays based on blocking antibodies determined that both PD-1 and CD80 are involved in the B7-H1-mediated regulation of Bim in activated CD8(+) T cells. Our results suggest that B7-H1 may negatively regulate CD8(+) T‑cell memory by enhancing the  depletion of effector CD8(+) T cells through the upregulation of Bim. Our findings may provide a new strategy for targeting B7-H1 signaling in effector CD8(+) T cells to achieve protective antitumor memory responses."

These infections evoke incomplete immunity, as individuals can be repeatedly reinfected throughout life. We report that acute viral LRI causes rapid pulmonary CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (TCD8) functional impairment via programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) signaling, a pathway previously associated with prolonged antigenic stimulation during chronic infections and cancer. PD-1-mediated TCD8 impairment occurred acutely in mice following infection with human metapneumovirus or influenza virus. Viral antigen was sufficient for PD-1 upregulation, but induction of PD-L1 was required for impairment. During secondary viral infection or epitope-only challenge, memory TCD8 rapidly reexpressed PD-1 and exhibited severe functional impairment. Inhibition of PD-1 signaling using monoclonal antibody blockade prevented TCD8 impairment, reduced viral titers during primary infection, and enhanced protection of immunized mice against challenge infection. Additionally, PD-1 and  PD-L1 were upregulated in the lungs of patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza virus infection. These results indicate that PD-1 mediates TCD8 functional impairment during acute viral infection and may contribute to recurrent viral LRIs. Therefore, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may represent a therapeutic target in the treatment of respiratory viruses."

All lung cancer patients were newly-diagnosed, treatment-free and confirmed by histopathology or cytopathology. Eight-eight healthy volunteers matching in sex and age from the Healthcare Center of the hospital were also enrolled as controls.

Patient and physician education as well as good patient-caretaker communication are keys to limiting the morbidity of irAEs. Early recognition of these irAEs and initiation of treatment are critical to reduce the risk of complications, since virtually all irAEs are reversible with the use of steroids and other immune suppressants. The onset of grade 3 to 4 irAEs correlated with treatment response in some ipilimumab studies.

However, systemic administration of α-GalCer results in NKT cell anergy in which the cells are unresponsive to subsequent doses of α-GalCer. We show here that α-GalCer delivered as an adjuvant by the intranasal route, as opposed to the intravenous route, enables repeated activation of NKT cells and DCs, resulting in efficient induction of cellular immune responses to co-administered antigens. We show evidence that after intranasal delivery,α-GalCer is selectively presented by DCs  for the activation of NKT cells, not B cells. Furthermore, higher levels of PD-1  expression, a potential marker for functional exhaustion of the NKT cells when α-GalCer is delivered by the intravenous route, are not observed after intranasal delivery.

Mechanistically, CD80 mediates its effects  through its extracellular domain, which blocks the cell surface expression of PDL1 but does not prevent intracellular expression of PDL1 protein.

We show that this approach leads to a substantial reduction in the outgrowth of both experimental lung metastases and subcutaneous  tumors. Anti-CD27 treatment supports the maintenance of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells within the tumor, reduces the frequency of FoxP3-expressing CD4(+) T cells  within tumors, and potentiates the ability of NK1.1(+) and CD8(+) tumor infiltrating cells to secrete IFNγ upon coculture with tumor cells. The enhanced  effector function correlated with lower levels of PD-1 expression on CD8(+) T cells from anti-CD27-treated mice. Despite the modulating effect of anti-CD27 on  multiple cell types, only CD8(+) T cells were absolutely required for tumor control. The CD4(+) T cells were dispensable, whereas NK1.1(+) cells were needed  during early stages of tumor growth but not for the effectiveness of anti-CD27.

This phase I study sought to determine  the safety and tolerability of anti-PD-1 blockade in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumors and to preliminarily assess antitumor activity, pharmacodynamics, and immunologic correlates. Thirty-nine patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), castrate-resistant prostate cancer, non-small-cell lung  cancer (NSCLC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) received a single intravenous infusion of anti-PD-1 (MDX-1106) in dose-escalating six-patient cohorts at 0.3, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, followed by a 15-patient expansion cohort at 10 mg/kg. Patients with evidence of clinical benefit at 3 months were eligible for repeated therapy. Anti-PD-1 was well tolerated: one serious adverse event, inflammatory colitis, was observed in a patient with melanoma who received five doses at 1 mg/kg. One durable complete response (CRC) and two partial responses (PRs; melanoma, RCC) were seen. Two additional patients (melanoma, NSCLC) had significant lesional tumor regressions not meeting PR criteria. The serum half-life of anti-PD-1 was 12 to 20 days. However, pharmacodynamics indicated a sustained mean occupancy of > 70% of PD-1 molecules on circulating T cells > or = 2 months following infusion, regardless of dose. In nine patients examined, tumor cell surface B7-H1 expression appeared to correlate with the likelihood of response to treatment. CONCLUSION: Blocking the PD-1 immune checkpoint with intermittent antibody dosing is well tolerated and associated with evidence of antitumor activity. Exploration of alternative dosing regimens and combinatorial therapies with vaccines, targeted therapies, and/or other checkpoint inhibitors is warranted."

Herein, we demonstrate that a novel immunization strategy, encompassing sequential exposure  of the lymph node milieu to plasmid and peptide in a heterologous prime-boost fashion, results in considerable MHC class I-restricted immunity in mice. Plasmid-primed antigen expression was essential for the generation of a population of central memory T cells, expressing CD62L and low in PD-1, with substantial capability to expand and differentiate to peripheral memory and effector cells, following subsequent exposure to peptide. These vaccine-induced T cells dominated the T cell repertoire, were able to produce large amounts of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and recognized tumor cells effectively. In addition to outlining a feasible and effective method to transform plasmid DNA vaccination into a potentially viable immunotherapeutic approach for cancer, this study sheds light on the mechanism of heterologous prime-boost and the considerable heterogeneity of MHC class I-restricted T cell responses."

We have shown that ckit ligand is required for MDSC accumulation and Treg development. We hypothesized that sunitinib malate, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could reverse MDSC-mediated immune suppression and modulate the tumor microenvironment, thereby improving the efficacy of immune-based therapies. Treatment with sunitinib decreased the number of MDSC and Treg in advanced tumor-bearing animals. Furthermore, it not only reduced the suppressive function of MDSCs but also prevented tumor-specific T-cell anergy and Treg development. Interestingly, sunitinib treatment resulted in reduced expression of interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor-beta, and Foxp3 but enhanced expression of Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma and increased CTL responses in isolated tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. A significantly higher percentage and infiltration of CD8 and CD4 cells was detected in tumors of sunitinib-treated mice when compared with control-treated mice. More importantly, the expression of negative costimulatory  molecules CTLA4 and PD-1 in both CD4 and CD8 T cells, and PDL-1 expression on MDSC and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, was also significantly decreased by sunitinib treatment. Finally, sunitinib in combination with our immune therapy protocol (IL-12 and 4-1BB activation) significantly improves the long-term survival rate of large tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest that sunitinib can  be used to reverse immune suppression and as a potentially useful adjunct for enhancing the efficacy of immune-based cancer therapy for advanced malignancies."

We now examine the effect of concomitant tumors on the generation of effector T cells. We inoculated methylcholanthrene (MCA) 205 in the flanks of normal mice and mice bearing MCA 205 lung metastases. TDLN cells from these mice were activated and expanded in vitro, and adoptively transferred to mice bearing lung metastases. Effector T cells generated from TDLN in mice with only flank tumor mediated potent antitumor activity. However, antitumor efficacy of the effector T cells generated from TDLN in mice with pre-existent lung tumor (cTDLN) was reduced. Phenotyping studies showed that dendritic cells in cTDLN expressed higher levels of B7-H1, whereas cTDLN T cells expressed higher levels of PD-1. The levels of IFNgamma were reduced, and the levels of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells were increased in cTDLN versus TDLN. The in vitro activation of cTDLN was increased by blocking B7-H1 or transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Importantly, we found a synergistic up-regulation of IFNgamma with simultaneous blockade of B7-H1 and TGF-beta that was much greater than observed with TDLN. In vitro activation of cTDLN with anti-B7-H1 and anti-TGF-beta and in vivo administration of these antibodies after adoptive transfer resulted in the abrogation of the suppression  associated with cTDLN. These results show a major role for the B7-H1/PD-1 axis and TGF-beta as synergistic suppressive mechanisms in cTDLN. Our data have clinical relevance in the generation of effector T cells in the tumor-bearing host."

Engagement of BTLA on T lymphocytes can profoundly reduce the T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation. In this study, we generated four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human BTLA. Using the produced mAb 8H9, the BTLA molecule was found to distinctly express on many subgroups of immunocytes and show a regulatory expression, which  was in accordance with its unique ligand herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) in the process of T cell activation. In addition, the expression of BTLA was increased in the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells of pleural fluid in lung cancer patients. Furthermore, we showed that the BTLA-induced negative signals could be  triggered by mAb 7D7. Cross-linking of BTLA with mAb 7D7 suppressed T lymphocyte  proliferation, downregulated the expression of T cell activation marker CD25, and inhibited the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-10."

The immunobiologic effects of ticilimumab,  a human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, was administered to patients with metastatic melanoma who participated in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Thirty patients who received ticilimumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg monthly (n=20) or 15 mg/kg every 3 months (n=10) were studied at study entry and at 14-day intervals thereafter to assess lymphocyte immunophenotypes, interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-10 production, and the expression of TR-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a subset of patients was studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Four of 12 patients with immune-related adverse events (IRAE) attained objective antitumor responses (ATR), whereas only 1 of 18 patients without IRAE attained ATR (chi2=4.0; P=.0455). Patients with ATR had significant reductions in T(R) cells and constitutive IL-10 production accompanied by a significant increase in IL-2 production by activated T cells. Although IRAE+/ATR+ patients demonstrated a positive correlation between CTLA-4 and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) transcripts (Spearman rho=.522; P=.015), IRAE-/ATR- patients had a positive correlation between the transcripts of CTLA-4  and program death-1 (PD-1) receptor (Spearman rho=.891; P=.000). Antitumor responses in patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated with ticilimumab were found to be correlated with reductions in TR cells  and constitutive secretion of IL-10, an increase in IL-2 production, and a positive correlation between transcripts of CTLA-4 and GITR.

However, strong T-cell response does not always  coincide with tumor rejection, for which upregulated expression of immunoinhibitory molecules may be responsible. In this study, the treatment with  heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) vaccine induced an infiltration of T cells into the tumor site as well as the expression of IFN-gamma and IL-2, and delayed lung metastases of tumor, but the tumor progression nonetheless occur finally. We demonstrated that B7-H1 expressed by residual tumor cells was responsible for the resistance of tumor to the therapy with HSP70 vaccine. Blockade of B7-H1 by i.v.  injection pPD-1A, a plasmid encoding the extracellular domain of PD-1 (sPD-1), could reverse this resistance and enhance the therapeutic efficacy. To complement these findings, we investigated the gene expression of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by Real-time PCR analysis, which revealed that the expression  of TH1 cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2 by TIL in the mice treated with HSP70 vaccine in combination with sPD-1 was increased and the expression of negative regulatory molecules IL-10, TGF-beta and foxp3 was decreased, demonstrating that multifunctional properties afforded by the combination therapy can effectively overcome tumor resistance and promote effective antitumor immunity. The in vivo transfection with pPD-1A could be performed as infrequently as once a week and still produce a significant antitumor effect. These findings suggest that the treatment with HSP70 vaccine followed by blockade of tumor-B7-H1 with sPD-1 may provide a promising approach for tumor immunotherapy."

Previously we and others demonstrated a novel mechanism that allows tumors to escape from the host immune response by expressing PD-L1 which can negatively regulate immune response through the interaction with PD-1, an immunoinhibitory receptor belonging to the CD28 family. In this study, we report  that hematogenous spread of poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma cells to the liver was inhibited in PD-1-deficient mice. After inoculation to spleen, PD-L1 was induced on tumor cells, which did not express PD-L1 in vitro. As compared with wild-type mice, intrasplenic injection of B16 cells into PD-1-deficient mice showed enhanced induction of effector T cells in spleen, prolonged T cell proliferation and cytokine production, and augmented homing of effector T cells to tumor sites in the liver, resulting in accumulation of effector T cells in the tumor sites. PD-1 blockade by genetic manipulation or antibody treatment inhibited not only hematogenous dissemination of B16 melanoma cells to the liver  on the C57BL/6 background, but also dissemination of CT26 colon cancer cells to the lung on the BALB/c background. These results suggest that PD-1 blockade may be a powerful tool for treatment of hematogenous spread of various tumor cells."

Furthermore, we examined the correlation between B7-H1 expression on tumor cells and the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) or PD-1 expression on TILs. The expression of B7-H1 and B7-DC in 52 surgically resected  specimens of non-small cell lung cancer was evaluated immunohistochemically. Expression of B7-H1 and B7-DC was focally observed in all non-small cell lung cancer tumor specimens. No relationship was found between the expression of  B7-H1 or B7-DC and clinicopathological variables or postoperative survival. However, in the same sections evaluated, significantly fewer TILs were identified in B7-H1-positive tumor regions than in B7-H1-negative tumor regions in a subset  of five patients (P = 0.01). Moreover, the percentage of TILs expressing PD-1 was significantly lower in B7-H1-positive tumor regions than in B7-H1-negative tumor  regions (P = 0.02). The expression of B7-H1 on tumor cells in local areas reciprocally correlated with the number of TILs, and this may contribute to negative regulation in antitumor immune responses in non-small cell lung cancer."

We report here that, except for cells of the macrophage lineage, normal human tissues do not express B7-H1. In contrast, B7-H1 is abundant in human carcinomas of lung, ovary  and colon and in melanomas. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma upregulates B7-H1 on the surface of tumor cell lines. Cancer cell-associated B7-H1 increases apoptosis of antigen-specific human T-cell clones in vitro, and the apoptotic effect of B7-H1 is mediated largely by one or more receptors other  than PD-1. In addition, expression of B7-H1 on mouse P815 tumor increases apoptosis of activated tumor-reactive T cells and promotes the growth of highly immunogenic B7-1(+) tumors in vivo. These findings have implications for the design of T cell-based cancer immunotherapy."

Mice deficient in PD-1 exhibit a breakdown of peripheral tolerance and demonstrate multiple autoimmune features. We report here that the ligand of PD-1 (PD-L1) is a member of the B7 gene family. Engagement of PD-1 by PD-L1 leads to the inhibition of T cell receptor-mediated lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion. In addition, PD-1 signaling can inhibit at least suboptimal levels of CD28-mediated costimulation. PD-L1 is expressed by antigen-presenting cells, including human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with interferon gamma, and activated human and murine dendritic cells. In addition, PD-L1 is expressed in nonlymphoid tissues such as heart and lung. The relative levels of inhibitory PD-L1 and costimulatory B7-1/B7-2 signals on antigen-presenting cells  may determine the extent of T cell activation and consequently the threshold between tolerance and autoimmunity. PD-L1 expression on nonlymphoid tissues and its potential interaction with PD-1 may subsequently determine the extent of immune responses at sites of inflammation."

The liposome was constructed by self-assembly of a phospholipid-conjugated prodrug, indoximod (IND), which inhibits the IDO-1 pathway, followed by theremote loading of the ICD-inducing chemo drug, doxorubicin (DOX). Intravenousinjection of the encapsulated two-drug combination dramatically improved thepharmacokinetics and tumor drug concentrations of DOX and IND in an orthotopic4T1 tumor model in syngeneic mice. Delivery of a threshold ICD stimulus resulted in the uptake of dying BC cells by dendritic cells, tumor antigen presentationand the activation/recruitment of naı̈ve T-cells. The subsequent activation ofperforin- and IFN-γ releasing cytotoxic T-cells induced robust tumor cell killingat the primary as well as metastatic tumor sites. Immune phenotyping of the tumortissues confirmed the recruitment of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs),disappearance of Tregs, and an increase in CD8+/FOXP3+ T-cell ratios. Not onlydoes the DOX/IND-Liposome provide a synergistic antitumor response that issuperior to a DOX-only liposome, but it also demonstrated that the carrier could be effectively combined with PD-1 blocking antibodies to eradicate lungmetastases.

A PD-L1 blockingantibody increased the expression of granzyme-B and perforin on polyclonal- andtumor-stimulated CD8+ T cells. Taken together, our data show that rather thanbeing exhausted, tumor-responding CD8+ T cells are not completely differentiated into effector cells and are prone to negative regulation by PD-L1.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of PD-1 (NAT105, CellMarque) and PD-L1 (28-8, Dako) protein was assessed in 55 NSCLC cell lines byimmunohistochemistry (IHC). PD-1 (NAT105, Cell Marque) and PD-L1 (22C3, Dako)protein expression was evaluated by IHC, and TIL percentage was scored, in 139surgically resected specimens from patients with NSCLC. RESULTS PD-1 was notexpressed on NSCLC cell lines. PD-L1 was expressed on 20 NSCLC cell lines(36.4%). A total of 60 patient samples (43.2%) were positive for PD-1 on theTILs, and 25 (18.0%) were positive for PD-L1 on tumor cells. High expression ofPD-1 on tumor cells was significantly correlated with higher expression of PD-L1 (P=0.026) and a higher percentage of TILs (P<0.001).

To date, there is only one report except our case, which described the correlation between FDG-PET and nivolumab.CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a 75-year-old man on nivolumab treatment formetastatic non-small cell lung cancer. He had undergone right lower lobectomy forlung adenocarcinoma in the right S8 segment 10 months prior to recurrence.Pathological findings revealed invasive adenocarcinoma, pT1bN2M0 stage IIIA.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was positive for de novo T790Mand anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was negative.Immunohistochemistry was negative for PD-L1. He underwent chemotherapy with acombination of cisplatin and pemetrexed for four cycles but developed progressivedisease involving the right hemithorax, multiple lymph nodes, and multipleosseous sites. Nivolumab was instituted as a second-line chemotherapy. After six courses of this immunotherapy, FDG-PET scan showed decreased FDG uptake in eachrecurrent lesion despite T lymphocyte activation by nivolumab. Serumcarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was also remarkably decreased.CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab's effect on recurrent NSCLC may be monitored by PET;larger studies are needed."

Epub 2016 Jun 29.","Allosteric inhibition of SHP2 phosphatase inhibits cancers driven by receptortyrosine kinases.","The non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, has animportant role in signal transduction downstream of growth factor receptorsignalling and was the first reported oncogenic tyrosine phosphatase. Activating mutations of SHP2 have been associated with developmental pathologies such asNoonan syndrome and are found in multiple cancer types, including leukaemia, lungand breast cancer and neuroblastoma. SHP2 is ubiquitously expressed and regulatescell survival and proliferation primarily through activation of the RAS–ERKsignalling pathway. It is also a key mediator of the programmed cell death 1(PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) immune checkpoint pathways.Reduction of SHP2 activity suppresses tumour cell growth and is a potentialtarget of cancer therapy. Here we report the discovery of a highly potent(IC50 = 0.071 μM), selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule SHP2inhibitor, SHP099, that stabilizes SHP2 in an auto-inhibited conformation. SHP099concurrently binds to the interface of the N-terminal SH2, C-terminal SH2, andprotein tyrosine phosphatase domains, thus inhibiting SHP2 activity through anallosteric mechanism. SHP099 suppresses RAS–ERK signalling to inhibit theproliferation of receptor-tyrosine-kinase-driven human cancer cells in vitro and is efficacious in mouse tumour xenograft models. Together, these data demonstratethat pharmacological inhibition of SHP2 is a valid therapeutic approach for thetreatment of cancers."

Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2016 Jun 1;20(3):319-26. doi: 10.1188/16.CJON.319-326.","Programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors are novelimmuno-oncology agents.","Unlike chemotherapy or targeted agents, which inhibit tumor cell proliferation or induce tumor cell death, immune checkpoint inhibitorsare designed to stimulate a patient's own immune system to eliminate tumors. As aresult of their mechanism of action, PD-1 pathway inhibitors are associated with adverse events (AEs) with immunologic etiologies, termed immune-mediated AEs(imAEs). These include skin and gastrointestinal AEs, and endocrine, hepatic,renal, and respiratory AEs, including pneumonitis. Most imAEs can be effectively managed with treatment interruption/discontinuation and/or steroids or otherimmunosuppressive agents. A specialist consult may be required in some cases, andendocrine imAEs may require permanent hormone replacement therapy.OBJECTIVES: This article provides an overview of PD-1 inhibitors, including thepotential mechanism of action, key clinical trial data, and strategies formanaging patients who may receive PD-1 inhibitors for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.METHODS: Information in the article comes from PubMed literature searches and theauthor's experience with these agents in clinical trials.FINDINGS: Oncology clinicians must thoroughly assess baseline functioning andsymptoms and be vigilant for imAEs, which require prompt diagnosis andmanagement. A good understanding of the clinical profile of PD-1 pathwayinhibitors is instrumental in helping clinicians manage patients receiving these new therapies."

Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2016;16(1):13-20.","Pembrolizumab for the treatment of PD-L1 positive advanced or metastaticnon-small cell lung cancer.","The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors marked an important advancement in the development of cancer therapeutics. Pembrolizumab is a selective humanizedIgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that inhibits the programmed death-1 (PD-1)receptor, an integral component of immune checkpoint regulation in the tumormicroenvironment. The drug is currently approved by the Food and DrugAdministration for the treatment of advanced melanoma and metastatic squamous andnonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several published studiesdemonstrate that single-agent pembrolizumab is safe and has efficacy in patients with NSCLC. Many ongoing protocols are investigating the role of pembrolizumab incombination with other agents in lung cancer and various other cancer types. Wereview the available data on pembrolizumab in NSCLC and examine the role ofpotential predictive biomarkers of response to therapy."

Epub 2015 Sep 4.","Immunotherapy of cancer encompasses different strategies that elicit or enhance the immune response against tumors.","The first results from clinical studies have provided promising data for the treatment of lung cancer patients withimmunomodulating monotherapies. To improve the potential benefit of cancerimmunotherapy, synergistic combinations of the various immunotherapy approachesor of different elements within each of the immunotherapy approaches are beingexplored. The rationale typically involves different but complementary mechanismsof action, eventually impinging on more than one immune system mechanism. As aprominent example, the simultaneous blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 is giving rise totherapeutic synergy, while still offering room for efficacy improvement.Moreover, combinations of immunomodulating agents with chemotherapy or targetedmolecules are being tested. Animal models suggest that immunotherapies incombination with these various options offer evidence for synergistic effects andare likely to radically change cancer treatment paradigms. However, data obtainedso far indicate that toxic side effects are also potentiated, which may evenrestrict the selection of patients that are suitable for these combinationalapproaches. Advancing the field of combinatorial immunotherapy will requirechanges in the way investigational agents are clinically developed as well asnovel experimental end-points for efficacy evaluation. However, this combinedtherapeutic manipulation of both tumor and stromal cells may lead to a dramaticchange in the therapeutic options of lung cancer patients in any disease stagethat can only grossly be appreciated by the current studies."

Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2012 Oct;12(10):1279-82. doi: 10.1586/era.12.109.","PD-1 blockade: promoting endogenous anti-tumor immunity.","The co-inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 acts to dampen immune responses in peripheral tissues via interaction with its widely distributed ligand(s). Thelatter function as a final shield to protect tissues from immunological attack by T cells and help to maintain peripheral tolerance and prevent autoimmunity.Upregulation in a variety of cancers is thought to be one mechanism by which theyevade immunological eradication. The study by Topalian and colleagues evaluating the role of blockade of this pathway with a monoclonal antibody in patients with advanced cancer is reviewed. This large Phase I study demonstrates encouragingresponse rates in patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small-celllung cancer. Although the spectrum of toxicity was similar to that seen withblockade of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, the severity appeared lower in mostcases. After a long wait, it finally seems that immune-based anticancer therapiesare emerging to become part of the mainstream."
