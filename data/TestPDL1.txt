SCLC is an immunogenic tumor with high somatic mutation rates due to tobacco exposure resulting in potential neo-antigens, the presence of suppressed immune responses, and occurrence of paraneoplastic disorders. The use of T cell immune-checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD1: nivolumab, pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1: atezolizumab, durvalumab; anti-CTLA-4: ipilimumab, tremelimumab) have shown promising antitumor activity with the potential to prolong survival in SCLC patients. In fact, atezolizumab when combined with chemotherapy has achieved the milestone of being the first drug to improve survival in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage SCLC. Other immunotherapeutic approaches evaluated in clinical trials for SCLC include the use of cytokines, cancer vaccines, antiganglioside therapies, TLR9 inhibition, anti-Notch signaling, and anti-CD47. This review discusses the rationale and clinical evidence of immunotherapy in SCLC, the conflictive clinical results of novel immunotherapeutic agents and combinatorial therapies under evaluation in SCLC patients."

In this study, we reviewed the frequency and spectrum of cutaneous adverse events (AEs) caused by PD-1 antibodies and their possible correlation with treatment response.  METHODS: We reviewed records of all patients from a single institution treated with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab from August 1, 2014 to April 1, 2017. RESULTS: Of 211 patients included in the study, 134 (63.5%) were treated with nivolumab and 77 (36.5%) with pembrolizumab. Thirty-five patients (16.4%) developed cutaneous AEs. Cutaneous AEs were significantly associated with longer treatment cycles (P = 0.001). The prevalence of cutaneous AEs did not differ between nivolumab (17.2%) and pembrolizumab (15.6%). Patient age, gender, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale and underlying malignancy were not associated with development of cutaneous AEs. Median time until onset of cutaneous AEs was 50.0 days (range, 1-378 days). Anti-PD-1 therapy was tolerable in most of patients with grade 1 (65.2%) and grade 2 (23.9%) cutaneous AEs.  Pruritus (32.6%) and eczema (21.7%) were the most commonly reported cutaneous AEs. In lung cancer patients, cutaneous AEs were not associated with better treatment outcomes after adjusting for the number of treatment cycles.  CONCLUSION: Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab exhibited tolerable cutaneous safety profiles in a variety of cancer patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy. Cutaneous AEs of anti-PD-1 therapy were not associated with antibody type, underlying malignancy, patient characteristics, or improved response.© 2019 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences."

[Epub ahead of print]","Durvalumab in cancer medicine: a comprehensive review.","Introduction: The U.S. FDA has approved durvalumab for the treatment of advanced urothelial and non-small cell lung cancers. However, this immunotherapy agent is also being explored in other cancers. There is also ongoing research to better predict the responses to this drug. Areas covered: We summarize the literature regarding durvalumab pharmacology, safety and efficacy in several tumor types. We searched PubMed/Medline database from inception to 20 April 2019, performed a snowball method, and visited independent websites such as the U.S. FDA ( https://www.fda.gov ), ClinicalTrials.gov, among others. Expert opinion: Advanced phase clinical trials have shown benefit of durvalumab in advanced urothelial and non-small cell lung cancers, and suggest benefit in several other tumor types. This agent has a tolerable toxicity profile and seems more effective in patients with a higher PDL-1 expression, although this correlation is not perfect. An improved method to predict a response to durvalumab would be beneficial to best tailor therapy and minimize medical care costs. More research is needed to establish its efficacy in different disease stages and applicability in other tumor types. Hopefully, prospective, randomized trials of durvalumab, alone and/or in combination with other agents, will bring answers to these questions in the near future."

[Epub ahead of print]","Comprehensive analysis of potential immunotherapy genomic biomarkers in 1000 Chinese patients with cancer.","BACKGROUND: Tumor mutation burden (TMB), DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), microsatellite instability (MSI), and PD-L1 amplification (PD-L1 AMP) may predict the efficacy of the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. With the broadening landscape of immunotherapy use, it is important to identify patients who are likely to benefit from the therapy. This study aimed to characterize the distributions of these biomarkers and explore the relationships among these biomarkers for Chinese patients with cancer. METHODS: In this study, we examined the aforementioned biomarkers in more than 1000 Chinese patients with cancer. These biomarkers were determined based on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of tumor/blood samples. RESULTS: Of the 953 samples from Chinese cancer patients assessed in this study, 35% exhibited high TMB (TMB-H), 4% were positive for high MSI (MSI-H), dMMR occurred in 0.53%, and PD-L1 AMP was positive in 3.79%. We found higher rates of TMB-H among hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and esophageal cancer patients than was reported for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations had significantly lower TMB values than those with wild-type EGFR, and increased TMB was significantly associated with dMMR in colorectal cancer (CRC). The frequency of tumors with MSI-H was the highest in CRC and gastric cancer. PD-L1 AMP occurred most frequently in lung squamous cell carcinoma and HER2-positive breast cancer. While MSI and dMMR are associated with higher mutational loads, correlations between TMB-H and other biomarkers, between MSI-H and dMMR, and between PD-L1 AMP and other biomarkers were low, indicating different underlying causes of the four biomarkers. CONCLUSION: The results reveal the frequency of these biomarkers in different malignancies, with potential implications for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade use for Chinese patients with cancer.© 2019 The Authors.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 18 NSCLC patients who received atezolizumab after anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. Data on patient characteristics, number of cycles of anti-PD-1 antibody and atezolizumab, regimens between anti-PD-1 antibody and atezolizumab, best response, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Nine patients a had high (≥50%) PD-L1 expression. The median number of cycles of atezolizumab was 3 (range=2-7). The median progression-free survival was 2.9±1.8 months. Seven (38.9%) and 11 (61.1%) patients had stable and progressive disease, respectively. No patient achieved partial or complete response. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of irAEs between anti-PD-1 antibodies and atezolizumab. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results showed that patients previously treated with anti PD-1 antibodies received only limited benefit from subsequent atezolizumab."

METHODS: This prospective study of 42 patients treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor was approved by our institutional review board, and all patients gave written, informed consent. Tumor burden dynamics were assessed on F-FDG PET/CT before and after treatment initiation. Immunotherapeutic responses were evaluated according to RECIST 1.1, iRECIST, and PERCIST 1.0 for the dichotomous groups, responders versus nonresponders. Cohen κ and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to evaluate concordance among these criteria. We assessed progression-free survival and overall survival using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: The RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0 response classifications were discordant in 6 patients (14.2%; κ = 0.581). RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST were discordant in 2 patients, who evidenced pseudoprogression after treatment initiation. Median progression-free survival, as well as overall survival, was significantly longer for responders compared with nonresponders for all criteria (P < 0.001), with no significant difference between the 3 criteria (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST 1.0 show only moderate agreement, but both can predict treatment response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. In case of pseudoprogression, metabolic tumor activity may help to correctly classify treatment response."

Epub 2019 Jun 6.","Functional systemic CD4 immunity is required for clinical responses to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy.","The majority of lung cancer patients progressing from conventional therapies are refractory to PD-L1/PD-1 blockade monotherapy. Here, we show that baseline systemic CD4 immunity is a differential factor for clinical responses. Patients with functional systemic CD4 T cells included all objective responders and could be identified before the start of therapy by having a high proportion of memory CD4 T cells. In these patients, CD4 T cells possessed significant proliferative capacities, low co-expression of PD-1/LAG-3 and were responsive to PD-1 blockade ex vivo and in vivo. In contrast, patients with dysfunctional systemic CD4 immunity did not respond even though they had lung cancer-specific T cells. Although proficient in cytokine production, CD4 T cells in these patients proliferated very poorly, strongly co-upregulated PD-1/LAG-3, and were largely refractory to PD-1 monoblockade. CD8 immunity only recovered in patients with functional CD4 immunity. T-cell proliferative dysfunctionality could be reverted by PD-1/LAG-3 co-blockade. Patients with functional CD4 immunity and PD-L1 tumor positivity exhibited response rates of 70%, highlighting the contribution of CD4 immunity for efficacious PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

Infection of breast and renal tumor cells with rAd.sT produced sTGFβRIIFc protein with dose-dependent cytotoxicity. In immunocompetent mouse 4T1 breast tumor model, intratumoral delivery of rAd.sT inhibited both tumor growth and lung metastases. rAd.sT downregulated the expression of several transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) target genes involved in tumor growth and metastases, inhibited Th2 cytokine expression, and induced Th1 cytokines and chemokines, and granzyme B and perforin expression. rAd.sT treatment also increased the percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes, promoted the generation of CD4+ T memory cells, reduced regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), and reduced bone marrow-derived suppressor cells. Importantly, rAd.sT treatment increased the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes, and promoted differentiation and maturation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells in the spleen. In the immunocompetent mouse Renca renal tumor model, similar therapeutic effects and immune activation results were observed. In the 4T1 mammary tumor model, rAd.sT improved the inhibition of tumor growth and lung and liver metastases by anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Analysis of the human breast and kidney tumors showed that a significant number of tumor tissues expressed high levels of TGFβ and TGFβ-inducible genes. Therefore, rAd.sT could be a potential enhancer of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy for treating breast and kidney cancers."

Materials & methods: We evaluated interactions according to type of treatment-add-on strategy: immunotherapy in combination versus standard chemotherapy-based regimens. Hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were extracted and cumulated. Results: Seven trials (4278 patients) were included. The addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy-based regimens significantly increased OS (HR 0.74; p = 0.001) and PFS (HR 0.61; p < 0.0001) compared with standard-of-care in NSCLC patients in first-line setting. Conclusion: Immunotherapy-based regimens constantly improved OS and PFS compared with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of nononcogene-addicted NSCLC."

Epub 2019 May 3.","Safety evaluation of nivolumab added concurrently to radiotherapy in a standard first line chemo-radiotherapy regimen in stage III non-small cell lung cancer-The ETOP NICOLAS trial.","OBJECTIVES: Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) and concurrent PD-1 inhibition has shown promising results in pre-clinical models. So far, the feasibility of delivering concurrent CRT and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has never been assessed in a clinical trial. MATERIAL AND METHODS: NICOLAS is a phase-II trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of nivolumab combined with CRT in stage III NSCLC. Patients received 3 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy and concurrent RT (66 Gy/33fractions). Nivolumab started concurrently with RT. The primary endpoint was 6-month post-RT rate of grade-≥3-pneumonitis. A formal interim safety analysis (IA) was scheduled when the first 21 patients reached 3 months follow-up post-RT. An early positive safety conclusion would be reached at IA if there were no grade ≥3-pneumonitis in those patients. Efficacy evaluation was planned provided the safety conclusion was reached. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: As of 13 December 2018, 82 patients were recruited with median follow-up of 13.4 months. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were anaemia, fatigue and pneumonitis. No unexpected AEs or increased toxicities were observed. For the first 21 patients, no grade-≥3-pneumonitis was observed by the end of the 3-month post-RT follow-up period. The early safety IA provides evidence that the addition of nivolumab to concurrent CRT is safe and tolerable regarding the 6-month rate of pneumonitis grade ≥3 at the one-sided significance level of 5%. Following that, the 1-year progression-free survival will be evaluated in an expanded patient cohort. NICOLAS trial creates the opportunity for assessing the activity of the combination of checkpoint with concurrent CRT in larger prospective trials for locally advanced NSCLC."

Epub 2019 Apr 27.","Correlation between serum adenosine deaminase activity and efficacy of anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody.","OBJECTIVE: Serum adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity is a marker of immune reaction to several diseases. We evaluated changes in serum ADA in patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy or anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) therapy to examine the correlation between serum ADA and the therapy efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 50 patients with advanced lung cancer receiving chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 therapy. Serum ADA was measured before and on day 7 of the first treatment cycle and day 0 of subsequent cycles. Correlations between ADA change and efficacy of treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 20 were treated with chemotherapy and 30 were treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. Serum ADA decreased significantly between baseline and day 7 of the first cycle in patients undergoing chemotherapy, regardless of response (partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]: -23% [-38 to +32; p =  0.002]; progressive disease [PD]: -12% [-42 to +6; p =  0.500]). Conversely, in patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy, serum ADA increased significantly between baseline and 7 days after the first dose and before subsequent doses in patients who had PR or SD. (day 7 of first cycle: +6% [-10 to +34; p =  0.034], day 0 of second cycle: 8% [-5 to +37; p =  0.002], day 0 of third cycle: 9% [-3 to +55; p =  0.002]). However, serum ADA did not significant change in PD patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy. Furthermore, early increases in serum ADA were associated with longer progression-free survival in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy (p =  0.006). CONCLUSION: Changes in serum ADA could be used to predict clinical benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with lung cancer. The association between changes in serum ADA and the efficacy of ant-PD-1 therapy thus remains inconclusive and requires further study."

We sought to characterize the effects of KRAS mutation subtypes and concurrent pathogenic mutations on overall survival (OS) and PD-L1 expression, a predictive biomarker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC at a single institution and abstracted clinical, molecular, and pathologic data from electronic health records. Cox regression and multinomial logistic regression were used to determine how KRAS mutation subtypes and concurrent pathogenic mutations are associated with OS and tumor PD-L1 expression, respectively. RESULTS: A total 186 patients were included. Common KRAS mutation subtypes included G12C (35%) and G12D (17%). Concurrent pathogenic mutations were identified in TP53 (39%), STK11 (12%), KEAP1 (8%), and PIK3CA (4%). On multivariable analysis, KRAS G12D mutations were significantly associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-5.16; P = 0.021), as were STK11 co-mutations (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.27-6.88; P = 0.012). Compared to no (<1%) PD-L1 expression, KRAS G12C mutations were significantly associated with positive yet low (1-49%) PD-L1 expression (odds ratio [OR] 4.94, 95% CI 1.07-22.85; P = 0.041), and TP53 co-mutations with high (≥50%) PD-L1 expression (OR 6.36, 95% CI 1.84-22.02; P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: KRAS G12D and STK11 mutations confer poor prognoses for patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC. KRAS G12C and TP53 mutations correlate with a biomarker that predicts benefit from immunotherapy. Concurrent mutations may represent distinct subsets of KRAS-mutant NSCLC; further investigation is warranted to elucidate their role in guiding treatment."

Prominent among these therapies are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), antibody-based drugs that can unleash the power of tumour-specific CD8 + T-cells. ICIs targeting the Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) cell surface receptor or its ligand PD-L1 are particularly effective, with clinical studies reporting powerful and durable therapeutic impact against many cancer types, including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. ICIs have the potential to transform the landscape of cancer treatment, and their development was recognised by the award of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to James Allison and Tasuku Honjo. However, the proportion of patients responding to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy can be low. The next major challenge involves understanding and overcoming the innate and acquired resistance that prevents most patients from responding to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. In this review, we outline the physiological function of PD-1 and its exploitation by developing tumours. We give an overview of current FDA-approved drugs targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 and summarise clinical progress so far. We then discuss key mechanisms thought to underpin resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, describing biomarkers that could allow patient responses to be predicted before treatment, and tracked once treatment has started. We also present clinical and pre-clinical combination therapies that have been developed to overcome resistance and which have the potential to substantially extend the therapeutic reach of these revolutionary drugs."

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with pathologically proven lung cancer from a single institution. PD-L1 expression determined by Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) was detected using 22C3 pharmDx (Agilent Technologies) and SP263 (Ventana Medical Systems) assays. RESULTS: From July 2016 to July 2017, 267 patients were enrolled. The main histologic type was adenocarcinoma (69.3%). Most participants were smokers (67.4%) and had clinical stage IV disease (60.7%). In total, 116 (42%) and 58 (21%) patients had TPS ≥1% and ≥50%, respectively. The patients were significantly older in TPS ≥1% group than in TPS <1% group (64.83±9.38 years vs. 61.73±10.78 years, p=0.014), not in TPS ≥50% cutoff value (64.69 ± 9.39 vs. 62.36 ± 10.51, p= 0.178). Regarding histologic grade, higher proportions of poorly differentiated tumor were observed in the TPS ≥1% (40.8% vs. 25.8%, p=0.020) and TPS ≥50% groups (53.2% vs. 27.2%, p=0.004). Among 34 patients examined with 22C3 and SP263 assays, 27 had positive results in both assays, with a cutoff of TPS ≥1% (r=0.826; 95% confidence interval, 0.736-0.916). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression, defined as TPS ≥1%, was related to older age and poorly differentiated histology. There was a similar distribution of PD-L1 expression in both 22C3 and SP263 results."

These therapies work by reactivating the immune system and enabling it to target cancer cells once more. There is a general agreement that expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells predicts the therapeutic response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in NSCLC. Hence, immunohistochemical staining of tumour tissue biopsies from NSCLC patients with PD-L1 antibodies is the current standard used to aid selection of patients for treatment with anti-PD-1 as first line therapy. However, issues of small tissue samples, tissue heterogeneity, the emergence of new metastatic sites, and dynamic changes in the expression of PD-L1 may influence PD-L1 status during disease evolution. Re-biopsy would expose patients to the risk of complications and tardy results. Analysis of PD-L1 expression on circulating tumour cells (CTCs) may provide an accessible and non-invasive means to select patients for anti-PD-1 therapies. Additionally, CTCs could potentially provide a useful biomarker in their own right. Several published studies have assessed PD-L1 expression on CTCs from NSCLC patients. Overall, analysis of PD-L1 on CTCs is feasible and could be detected prior to and after frontline therapy. However, there is no evidence on whether PD-L1 expression on CTCs could predict the response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. This review examines the challenges that need to be addressed to demonstrate the clinical validity of PD-L1 analysis in CTCs as a biomarker capable of predicting the response to immune checkpoint blockade."

Much effort is ongoing to identify robust prognostic and predictive biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, overcoming PD-L1 that appears limited in its ability to discriminate patient candidates to this new class of anticancer agents. The purpose of this research study is to identify potential new biomarkers for immunotherapy in lung cancer. METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC treated with nivolumab were enrolled in the study. All the patients received a blood analysis looking for the relationship between different populations of baseline white blood cells and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Gr-MDSC) detected by flow cytometry, to identify and characterize patients with poor likelihood of benefit from nivolumab in NSCLC second-line setting, regardless of clinical feature and PDL1 expression. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that high baseline levels of Gr-MDSC and low baseline CD8/Gr-MDSC ratio are associated with significantly better (P = 0.02) response to immunotherapy treatment. Log-rank tests suggested a significant improvement in OS and PFS with high baseline levels of Gr-MDSC levels (≥ 6 cell/μl), low absolute neutrophil count (< 5840/μl), high eosinophil count (> 90 /μl), and NLR < 3. The multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant improvement for PFS (P = 0.003) and OS (P = 0.05) in favour of the identified good prognostic Gr-MDSC-linked asset group, compared with the poor prognosis group. CONCLUSION: The role of Gr-MDSC appears interesting as a potential biomarker in NSCLC patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Further analyses are needed to confirmed and study in deep the role of these particular cells and their role in cancer response and progression during ICI therapy."

[Epub ahead of print]","Prospects for a personalized peptide vaccine against lung cancer.","Introduction: The tumor characteristics and immunological status of the host should be carefully considered for the successful development of cancer peptide vaccines. Recently, personalized peptide vaccines (PPV) that individually select antigens for each patient are being developed for lung cancer. Areas covered: Novel PPV, in which appropriate vaccine antigens are selected in each patient by assessing preexisting immunity to a panel of vaccine peptide candidates, have been attempted with promising results in early-phase clinical trials for lung cancer. Additionally, PPV targeting neo-antigens derived from genetic mutations have been currently attempted with high anticipation of success in various cancers, because they can be recognized as foreign by the host immune system. In this review, we present an overview of the current progress and future directions of such PPV for patients with lung cancer. Expert opinion: Both genetic characterization of tumor cells and assessment of the immune responses to potential tumor antigens might be a key component for facilitating successful cancer vaccine development. In addition, not only selection of immunogenic epitopes, but also appropriate modulation of the host immunological status should be considered; clinical trials combining neo-antigen vaccines and anti-PD-1 antibodies for lung cancer are currently ongoing and their results are awaited."

[Epub ahead of print]","Determinants of immunological evasion and immunocheckpoint inhibition response in non-small cell lung cancer: the genetic front.","The incorporation into clinical practice of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as those targeting the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), has represented a major breakthrough in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment, especially in cases where the cancer has no druggable genetic alterations. Despite becoming the standard of care in certain clinical settings, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, a proportion of patients do not respond while others actually progress during treatment. Therefore, there is a clinical need to identify accurate predictive biomarkers and to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on ICIs. Although they have limitations, the current markers evaluated to select which patients will undergo ICI treatment are the levels of PD-L1 and the tumor mutational burden. In this paper we describe what is currently known about the dynamic interaction between the cancer cell and the immune system during carcinogenesis, with a particular focus on the description of the functions and gene alterations that preclude the host immunoresponse in NSCLC. We emphasize the deleterious gene alterations in components of the major histocompatibility complex (HLA-I or B2M) and of the response to IFNγ (such as JAK2) which are mutually exclusive and can affect up to one fifth of the NSCLCs. The participation of other gene alterations, such as those of common oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and of the epigenetic alterations will also be discussed, in detail. Finally, we discuss the potential use of the tumors genetic profile to predict sensitivity to ICIs."

The current study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of PD-L1 immunostaining and quantitation on direct Papanicolaou-stained cytological smears compared with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (cytological cell blocks and surgical resection specimens) in NSCLC cases using 2 commercially available assays: the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent Technologies/Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and the Ventana SP263 Assay (Ventana Medical Systems Inc, Tucson, Arizona). METHODS: PD-L1 immunostaining using either both or one of the assays was tested in 117 sets of paired samples obtained from 62 NSCLC cases. The tumor proportion score was reported in every case following the recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). RESULTS: In 57 sets of samples, both PD-L1 assays were used. Due to the availability of samples, only 1 assay was performed in 3 sets of samples and in 2 cases, only cytology smears were used and tested for both assays. A total of 113 sets of paired samples finally were evaluated; 4 cases could not be studied due to intense nonspecific background staining. A significant concordance between the 2 assays on cytological smears was found. Concordance between paired cytological smears and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples was observed in 97.3% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: The quantification of PD-L1 expression on direct Papanicolaou-stained cytology smears is feasible and reliable for both PD-L1 assays. © 2019 American Cancer Society."

DESIGN: Series of PLWHIV cancer patients treated with anti-PD1 agents in real life clinical practice. METHODS: From May 2014 to January 2019, 575 HIV infected patients have been discussed in the French CANCERVIH national multidisciplinary board and included in the network database. 23 patients were treated with ICI in daily practice. We report the demographic characteristics, CD4 T cell counts, HIV viral loads, safety and efficacy data of these 23 PLWHIV treated in routine practice with nivolumab or pembrolizumab for non-small cell lung cancer (n = 21), melanoma (n = 1) and head and neck cancer (n = 1) retrospectively collected from the database CANCERVIH network. The median CD4 T cell count at treatment initiation was 370/mm (IQR: 125-1485). HIV viral load was undetectable in all patients. RESULTS: As of 29 April 2019, with a median follow-up of 10.8 months (2.0-27.7), the median number of injections was 6 (IQR: 4-18). Only two grade 3 adverse reactions were reported (no toxic deaths or immune-related deaths). Among the 23 patients, a partial response was observed in 5 patients (22%), a stabilization for 5 (22%) and a progression in 13 (57%). Only one patient experienced a positive HIV viral load, but this occurred following ART interruption. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with PD-1 inhibitors seems to have an efficacy signal and be well tolerated in PLWHIV, including impact on CD4 lymphocyte count and HIV load, that should be monitored during treatment course (regarding real-life experience)."

Recently, accumulating studies have demonstrated that chemotherapy after immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment may induce better objective responses in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. However, there are few reports on the increased effect of chemotherapy after nivolumab treatment in SCCHN.

The aim of this meta-analysis is an indirect comparison between anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 inhibitors. Methods: Seven studies (>4000 patients) were considered. Results: Considering the overall survival ICIs showed very robust efficacy over docetaxel, while in terms of progression-free survival the therapy with ICIs is slightly favored. Anti-PD-1 gives a more significant benefit than anti-PD-L1; however, excluding the KEYNOTE 010 trial that enrolled only PD-L1-positive patients, the subgroup difference remains only in terms of progression-free survival. Conclusion: This meta-analysis confirms the superiority of ICIs over docetaxel in pretreated non-small-cell lung cancer patients and would indicate a slight benefit from anti-PD-1 than from anti-PD-L1 inhibitors, always keeping in mind the possible biases of this indirect comparison."

In this study, we developed a quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) model to represent the anti-tumor immune response in human NSCLC that integrated our knowledge of tumor growth, antigen processing and presentation, T cell activation and distribution, antibody pharmacokinetics, and immune checkpoint dynamics. The model was calibrated with the available data and was used to identify potential biomarkers as well as patient-specific response based on the patient parameters. The model predicted that in addition to tumor mutational burden (TMB), a known biomarker for anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC, the number of effector T cells and regulatory T cells in the tumor and blood is a predictor of the responders. Furthermore, the model simulated a set of 12 patients with known TMB and MHC/antigen-binding affinity from a recent clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02259621) on neoadjuvant nivolumab therapy in resectable lung cancer and predicted an augmented durable response in patients with adjuvant nivolumab treatment in addition to the clinical trial protocol of neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment followed by resection. Overall, the model provides a valuable framework to model tumor immunity and response to immune checkpoint blockers to enhance biomarker discovery and performing virtual clinical trials to aid in design and interpretation of the current trials with fewer patients."

However, there are no established risk factors for its occurrence. Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) are areas of increased lung density on lung computed tomography (CT) in individuals with no known ILD. This study retrospectively investigated whether any patient characteristics, including ILA, were risk factors for ICI-ILD in patients with NSCLC. METHODS: NSCLC patients who received anti-programmed death (PD)-1 antibody treatment at our hospital between September 2015 and December 2017 were enrolled. Information on patient characteristics before anti-PD-1 antibody administration, including chest CT findings and laboratory data, were obtained. RESULTS: Among 83 enrolled patients, the incidence of ICI-ILD was 16.9% (14/83). All ICI-ILD cases developed by the third line of treatment. The incidence of ICI-ILD was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing ILA than that in those without (p = 0.007). Furthermore, patients with ground glass attenuation (GGA) in ILA had a higher incidence of ICI-ILD than that in those without (p < 0.001). In univariate logistic analysis, ILA were significant risk factors for ICI-ILD (p = 0.005). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that only GGA in ILA was a significant risk factor for ICI-ILD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing ILA are risk factors for ICI-ILD and GGA in ILA is an independent risk factor for ICI-ILD. Therefore, we should be more aware of the development of ICI-ILD in patients with ILA, especially those with GGA."

Is it ready for prime-time use for cancer patients?","BACKGROUND: The emergence of immunotherapy in oncology requires the discovery, validation and subsequent adoption of robust, sensitive and specific predictive and prognostic biomarkers for daily practice. Until now, anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue sections has been the only validated companion diagnostic test for first-line immunotherapy for advanced and metastatic cancer, notably non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, detection of this biomarker presents limitations which have stimulated the development of other biomarkers and other approaches. Within this context, the use of a liquid biopsy (LB) could provide an important complementary or alternative added value to PD-L1 IHC. DESIGN: In this review, we discuss how liquid biopsies (LBs) have been used in the field of immuno-oncology (I-O) to predict response, relapse or adverse advents for patients undergoing immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy (anti PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) and we highlight recent developments. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), proteins and cytokines detected in plasma as well as circulating T-lymphocytes are discussed as potential sources for developing new I-O biomarkers. RESULTS: The quantification of cfDNA as a predictive biomarker, as well as its sequencing for the determination of tumor mutational burden (TMB), is already well advanced. Additionally, the quantification of PD-L1 from CTCs, bound on exosomes or free in plasma, as well as the determination of cytokines, are also being actively investigated with promising results having recently been published. Lastly, analysis of T-lymphocytes, especially by analyzing the T-cell receptor, has recently emerged as a valuable biomarker that might become relevant for the prediction of response to ICIs. CONCLUSION: While LBs have not yet been implemented in routine I-O clinical practice, recent promising data and rapidly advancing technologies indicate that this approach has the potential to soon personalize the clinical management of cancer patients receiving ICIs.© The Author 2019.

Here we integrated somatic mutational profile and clinicopathologic information from 113 NSCLC patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (CTLA-4/PD-1). High tumor mutation burden (TMB) and neoantigen burden were identified significantly associated with improved efficacy in NSCLC immunotherapy. Furthermore, we identified APOBEC mutational signature was markedly associated with responding of ICB therapy (log-rank test, p = 0.001; OR, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.06-0.50], p < 0.001).

Combined high TMB with APOBEC signature preferably predict immunotherapy responders in NSCLC cohort. The CIBERSORT algorithm revealed that high APOBEC mutational activity samples were associated with increased infiltration of CD4 memory activated T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells, but reduced infiltration of regulatory T cells. Besides, individual genes mutation of IFNGR1 or VTCN1 were only found in responders, however, PTEN mutation was only found in non-responders (Fishers exact test, all p < 0.05).

This feature was more prominent in the TRM cell subset coexpressing PD-1 and TIM-3, and it was validated by functional assays ex vivo and also reflected in their chromatin accessibility profile. This PD-1+TIM-3+ TRM cell subset was enriched in responders to PD-1 inhibitors and in tumors with a greater magnitude of CTL responses.

This study aimed to investigate these markers in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) biopsies from patients with stage IIIB or IV ADC with little or no smoking history, to investigate their prognostic value and to correlate these results with the presence of driver mutations in the tumors. TIL were retrospectively evaluated on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides from 152 tumor samples. PD-1/PD-L1 expression was retrospectively evaluated with PD-1/PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) double staining on 74 tumor samples with sufficient residual tissue. PD-L1 expression was analysed on stromal cells of the tumor compartment, the tumor cells and TIL and PD-1 on TIL. Median overall survival (OS) was longer in patients with high stromal TIL infiltration compared to patients with low stromal TIL infiltration (68 weeks vs. 35 weeks respectively; p = 0.003). This was observed most prominently in KRAS mutant tumors (95 weeks vs. 12 weeks; p = 0.003). Only PD-L1 expression on tumor stromal cells influenced OS and indicated a worse prognosis (77 weeks vs 25 weeks; p = 0.013). Stromal TIL counts nor PD-1/PD-L1 expression levels were associated with the presence of driver mutations. The results of the current study reinforce the prognostic role of TIL in lung ADC, which is most prominent in KRAS mutant cancers. The results of the PD-1/PD-L1 analysis suggest that stromal cells can effectively suppress the anti-tumor immune response via the PD-L1 pathway."

Such CD8 T cells have been found in other chronic infections and also in cancer in mice and humans. These CD8 T cells exhibit stem-like properties undergoing self-renewal and also differentiating into the terminally exhausted CD8 T cells. Here we compared the epigenetic signature of stem-like CD8 T cells with exhausted CD8 T cells. ATAC-seq analysis showed that stem-like CD8 T cells had a unique signature implicating activity of HMG (TCF) and RHD (NF-κB) transcription factor family members in contrast to higher accessibility to ETS and RUNX motifs in exhausted CD8 T cells. In addition, regulatory regions of the transcription factors Tcf7 and Id3 were more accessible in stem-like cells whereas Prdm1 and Id2 were more accessible in exhausted CD8 T cells. We also compared the epigenetic signatures of the 2 CD8 T cell subsets from chronically infected mice with effector and memory CD8 T cells generated after an acute LCMV infection. Both CD8 T cell subsets generated during chronic infection were strikingly different from CD8 T cell subsets from acute infection. Interestingly, the stem-like CD8 T cell subset from chronic infection, despite sharing key functional properties with memory CD8 T cells, had a very distinct epigenetic program. These results show that the chronic stem-like CD8 T cell program represents a specific adaptation of the T cell response to persistent antigenic stimulation."

METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of patients between January 1, 2009 and April 1, 2018, across three metropolitan hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia. Eligible patients were identified from pharmacy records. Patients with a solid organ malignancy had discontinued checkpoint inhibitor therapy due to toxicity, and required immunosuppression in addition to corticosteroids to treat any immune-related adverse event. RESULTS: From 3860 patient dispensation records of immunosuppressive medications, 19 eligible patients were identified. Eight received a CTLA-4 inhibitor, four a PD-1 inhibitor, five combination immunotherapy, and two remained blinded. Sixteen patients had melanoma and three had non-small cell lung cancer. Median time to treatment failure was 8.7 months, and median overall survival was 9.4 months. Of those evaluable, the objective response rate was 35%, while 53% had progressive disease. Four patients died due to complications of their irAE, while six died from progressive disease. CONCLUSION: Patients who received immunosuppression for checkpoint inhibitor therapy toxicity had variable outcomes. This in part reflects a heterogeneous population, and the evolution of irAE management over time. Several patients continued to derive a benefit after cessation of therapy despite the use of immunosuppressive medications; conversely, four died as a direct consequence of their irAE. Physicians should promptly introduce immunosuppressive therapy in patients not responding to corticosteroids to mitigate the risk of life-threatening adverse events, given that current evidence does not clearly demonstrate a detriment to cancer-specific outcomes.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."

Median OS was 12.4 months and median PFS was 1.7 months; both were numerically longer in the PD-L1 ≥25% group than in the PD-L1 <25% group (OS 16.4 vs 7.6 months; PFS 2.6 vs 1.4 months). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 57.2%, were Grade 3/4 in 10.2%, and led to discontinuation in 5.6%. One patient (0.3%) died of treatment-related pneumonia with underlying pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: Durvalumab was clinically active irrespective of histology in this mostly pretreated population, with a manageable safety profile. Response rates and survival appeared to be enhanced in patients with greater tumoral PD-L1 expression."

[Epub ahead of print]","Immuno-Oncological Treatment and Tumor Mass in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Case-Control Analysis of Overall Survival in Routine Clinical Practice.","BACKGROUND: Immuno-oncological (IO) therapies such as PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have been introduced in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since 2015 based on randomized trials showing unprecedented advantages in overall survival (OS) with hazard ratios (HRs) between 0.5 and 0.7. The impact of these treatments on OS in routine clinical practice and the role of tumor mass have not been studied. METHODS: 557 consecutive patients with inoperable stage III or stage IV NSCLC diagnosed in our certified lung cancer center from 2006 to 2018 were included if they had received at least one line of systemic treatment. OS of immuno-oncologically treated patients (IO patients, n = 144) who received treatment with a PD-1 antibody (nivolumab [n = 77] or pembrolizumab [n = 51]) or a PD-L1 antibody (atezolizumab [n = 4] or durvalumab [n = 12]) was compared to historic controls treated before availability of IO treatment (n = 413) using case-control analysis. IO patients and historic controls were individually matched for stage, performance state, histology, smoking status, gender, age, and initial treatment mode (palliative vs. definitive radio-chemotherapy). RESULTS: Case-control analysis of 91 matched pairs showed significantly longer OS in IO patients compared to historic controls (21.2 vs. 10.9 months, HR 0.526, CI 0.373-0.723). The benefit was more pronounced in patients with lower tumor stage (HR 0.48 [stage III], 0.40 [IVA], 0.63 [IVB]) or smaller tumor size (HR 0.38 [RECIST ≤57 mm], 0.40 [RECIST 58-94 mm], 0.59 [RECIST 95-141 mm], 0.75 [RECIST ≥142 mm]). CONCLUSIONS: IO patients showed significant benefit in OS with HRs comparable to those reported in phase III trials. The benefit tended to be greater in patients with lower tumor mass.© 2019 S.

[Epub ahead of print]","18F-FDG PET metabolic-to-morphological volume ratio predicts PD-L1 tumour expression and response to PD-1 blockade in non-small-cell lung cancer.","PURPOSE: Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can restore tumour-specific T-cell immunity and is an emerging therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the correlation between 18F-FDG PET/CT-based markers and tumour tissue expression of PD-L1, necrosis and clinical outcome in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor treatment. METHODS: PD-Li expression in biopsy or resection specimens from 49 patients with confirmed NSCLC was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean), metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were obtained from 18F-FDG PET/CT images. The ratio of metabolic to morphological lesion volumes (MMVR) and its association with PD-L1 expression in each lesion were calculated. The associations between histologically reported necrosis and 18F-FDG PET imaging patterns and radiological outcome (evaluated by iRECIST) following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy were also analysed. In 14 patients, the association between necrosis and MMVR and tumour immune contexture were analysed by multiple immunofluorescent (IF) staining for CD8, PD-1, granzyme B (GrzB) and NFATC2. RESULTS: In total, 25 adenocarcinomas and 24 squamous cell carcinomas were analysed. All tumours showed metabolic 18F-FDG PET uptake. MMVR was correlated inversely with PD-L1 expression in tumour cells. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression and low MMVR were significantly correlated with clinical benefit. Necrosis was correlated negatively with MMVR. Multiplex IF staining showed a greater frequency of activated CD8+ cells in necrotic tumours than in nonnecrotic tumours in both stromal and epithelial tumour compartments. CONCLUSION: This study introduces MMVR as a new imaging biomarker and its ability to noninvasively capture increased PD-L1 tumour expression and predict clinical benefit from checkpoint blockade in NSCLC should be further evaluated."

Immunotherapy has been an effective option in other carcinogen-related cancers and has shown modest activity in SCLC. Monotherapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab in patients with at least two prior lines of therapy was associated with a response rate of 11.9% and a median duration of response of 17.9 months, leading to accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as third-line therapy for SCLC. Second-line checkpoint inhibitors have not performed well enough to change the standard of care, and maintenance immunotherapy has not shown significant benefit. However, the incorporation of concurrent immunotherapy in the first-line treatment of SCLC has improved outcomes. The addition of the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab to standard carboplatin plus etoposide led to an improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival, the first such improvement in over 30 years leading to the approval of atezolizumab as part of first-line therapy for advanced SCLC. While these landmark approvals offer promising novel treatment options for this recalcitrant disease, more work is needed to optimize their delivery and to build upon these important advances."

Currently, their clinical utility in NSCLC is compromised by a low detection rate with the established, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, EpCAM-based CellSearch® System. We tested an epitope-independent method (ParsortixTM system) and utilized it to assess PD-L1 expression of CTCs from NSCLC patients. We prospectively collected 127 samples, 97 of which were analyzed with the epitope-independent system in comparison to the CellSearch system. CTCs were determined by immunocytochemistry as intact, nucleated, CD45-, pankeratins (K)+ cells. PD-L1 status of CTCs was evaluated from 89 samples. With the epitope-independent system, ≥1 CTC per blood sample was detected in 59 samples (61%) compared to 31 samples (32%) with the EpCAM-based system. Upon PD-L1 staining, 47% of patients harbored only PD-L1+CTCs, 47% had PD-L1+ and PD-L1-CTCs, and only 7% displayed exclusively PD-L1-CTCs. The percentage of PD-L1+CTCs did not correlate with the percentage of PD-L1+ in biopsies determined by immunohistochemistry (p = 0.179). Upon disease progression, all patients showed an increase in PD-L1+CTCs, while no change or a decrease in PD-L1+CTCs was observed in responding patients (n = 11; p = 0.001). Our data show a considerable heterogeneity in the PD-L1 status of CTCs from NSCLC patients. An increase of PD-L1+CTCs holds potential to predict resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors."

Nivolumab is an anti-programmed death 1 protein (PD-1) antibody designed to augment an immunologic reaction against cancer cells. On the contrary, CPIs are known to cause a unique variety of side effects termed as immune-related adverse events, which can affect any organ including kidney. However, the characteristics of renal disorders by nivolumab treatment are poorly described. We describe two cases of acute kidney injury that were treated with nivolumab. Two patients, one with renal-cell carcinoma and the other with lung cancer, exhibited progressive renal dysfunction after the initiation of nivolumab treatment. By kidney biopsy, each case was diagnosed as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Of note, tubular epithelial cells enlarged with hyperchromatic nuclei were focally observed, and this finding was consistent with karyomegalic tubular epithelial cells. In immunostaining, most of the enlarged tubular epithelial cells were positive for Ki-67, which suggested regeneration of tubular epithelial cells. Clinically, in one case, renal function was partially recovered with the discontinuation of nivolumab, while in another case renal function was fully recovered with additional corticosteroid treatment. We presented nivolumab-induced AIN with karyomegalic changes of tubular epithelia. We propose that immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary for the full recovery from renal impairment."

Inhibition of MAPK pathway may have pleiotropic effects on the microenvironment. This work investigates the efficacy of combining MEK and PD-L1 inhibition in pre-clinical and ex-vivo NSCLC models. METHODS: We studied the effects of MEK inhibitors (MEK-I) on PD-L1 and MCH-I protein expression and cytokine production in vitro in NSCLC cell lines and in PBMCs from healthy donors and NSCLC patients, the efficacy of combining MEK-I with anti-PD-L1 antibody in ex-vivo human spheroid cultures obtained from fresh biopsies from NSCLC patients in terms of cell growth arrest, cytokine production and T-cell activation by flow cytometry. RESULTS: MEK-I modulates in-vitro the immune micro-environment through a transcriptionally decrease of PD-L1 expression, enhance of MHC-I expression on tumor cells, increase of the production of several cytokines, like IFNγ, IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα. These effects trigger a more permissive anti-tumor immune reaction, recruiting immune cells to the tumor sites. We confirmed these data on ex-vivo human spheroids, showing a synergism of MEK and PD-L1 inhibition as result of both direct cancer cell toxicity of MEK-I and its immune-stimulatory effect on cytokine secretion profile of cancer cells and PBMCs with the induction of the ones that sustain an immune-reactive and inflammatory micro-environment. CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows the biological rationale for combining immunotherapy with MEK-I in a reproducible ex-vivo 3D-culture model, useful to predict sensitivity of patients to such therapies."

[Epub ahead of print]","Improved prognosis and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in small cell lung cancer patients with neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes.","BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) develop a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS). Neurologic PNS are thought to improve prognosis, which we hypothesized is related to increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and immune recognition. METHODS: We queried 2,512,042 medical records from a single institution to identify SCLC patients with and without PNS and performed manual, retrospective chart review. We then performed multiplexed fluorescence immunohistochemistry and automated quantitative analysis (AQUA® Technology) on tumors to assess CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell infiltrates and PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. T cell infiltrates and PD-1/PD-L1 interaction scores were compared among patients with neurologic PNS, endocrinologic PNS, and a control group without PNS. Clinical outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: We evaluated 145 SCLC patients: 55 with PNS (25 neurologic and 30 endocrinologic) and 90 controls. Patients with neurologic PNS experienced improved overall survival (OS) compared to patients with endocrinologic PNS and controls (median OS 24mo vs. 12mo vs. 13mo, respectively). Of the 145 patients, we identified tumor tissue from 34 patients that was adequate for AQUA analysis. Among 37 specimens from these 34 patients, patients with neurologic PNS had increased T cell infiltrates (p=0.033) and PD-1/PD-L1 interaction (p=0.014) compared to tumors from patients with endocrinologic PNS or controls. CONCLUSION: Tumor tissue from patients with SCLC with neurologic PNS demonstrated increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-1/PD-L1 interaction consistent with an inflamed tumor microenvironment."

Patients and methods: Peripheral blood was obtained from 37 chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic NSCLC before treatment. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression was evaluated (1) on ICs with anti-tumor function (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, monocytes/dendritic cells) using flow cytometry, (2) on CTCs by immunofluorescence and (3) on cells from tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. The levels of PD-1+ and PD-L1+-expressing ICs were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS). Results: The presence of PD-1+ CD8+ cells, with reduced interferon (IFN)-γ expression, but not other ICs, were positively correlated with PD-L1+ CTCs (p < 0.04). Increased percentages of PD-1+ CD8+ T-cells, were associated with a worse response to treatment (p = 0.032) and shorter PFS (p = 0.023) which, in multivariate analysis, was revealed as an independent predictor for decreased PFS [hazard ratio (HR): 4.1, p = 0.0007]. Conclusion: The results of the current study, for first time, provide evidence for a possible interaction between ICs and CTCs in NSCLC patients via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and strongly support that the levels of PD-1+ CD8+ in these patients may be of clinical relevance."

We developed an improved humanized mouse model, derived from fresh cord blood CD34+ stem cells (CD34+ HSC), and combined it with lung cancer cell line-derived human xenografts or patient-derived xenografts (Hu-PDX). Fresh CD34+ HSCs could reconstitute detectable mature human leukocytes (hCD45+) in mice at four weeks without the onset of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Repopulated human T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DC), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) increased in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow over time. Although cultured CD34+ HSCs labeled with luciferase could be detected in mice, the cultured HSCs did not develop into mature human immune cells by four weeks, unlike fresh CD34+ HSCs. Ex vivo, reconstituted T cells, obtained from the tumor-bearing humanized mice, secreted IFNγ upon treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or exposure to human A549 lung tumor cells and mediated antigen-specific CTL responses, indicating functional activity. Growth of engrafted PDXs and tumor xenografts was not dependent on the human leukocyte antigen status of the donor. Treatment with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab or nivolumab inhibited tumor growth in humanized mice significantly, and correlated with an increased number of CTLs and decreased MDSCs, regardless of the donor HLA type. In conclusion, fresh CD34+HSCs are more effective than their expanded counterparts in humanizing mice, and do so in a shorter time.

Autoimmune diabetes is a rare but life-threatening endocrine adverse event, which has been reported in patients treated with anti-programmed-cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) and anti-programmed-cell death-1 ligand (anti-PD-L1) therapies. Case description: We report a 52-year-old woman with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at 24 weeks after atezolizumab initiation. She initially received oral antidiabetic medication from primary care hospital and experienced recurrent DKA 3 days later. Her plasma glucose on the day that she had recurrent DKA was 332 mg/dL (18.4 mmol/L), A1c was 7.9% (63 mmol/mol), fasting C-peptide was <0.03 nmol/L (0.1 ng/ml), fasting insulin level was <1 μIU/ml, anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA) was 7.2 U/ml (normal, >5 U/ml), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II typing was DR3-DQ2/DR14-DQ5. A diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes was made. After treatment for DKA, she recovered and received basal-bolus insulin treatment. Atezolizumab had been discontinued after the fifth cycle, prior to the development of DKA, due to progression of lung cancer. Conclusion: To date, there has been neither an effective way to detect if a patient is at high risk for autoimmune diabetes nor to prevent the complications associated with it. Regular glucose monitoring is the best method of early diabetes detection. In patients with new onset diabetes following treatment with ICIs, C-peptide levels and GADA should be screened, and insulin therapy should be prescribed to prevent hyperglycemic emergency while waiting for definite diagnosis."

METHODS: The medical records of 11 patients with advanced NSCLC who were initiated with nivolumab treatment between June 28, 2018, and January 15, 2019, in our hospital were reviewed. Serological tests of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free tetraiodothyronine were measured at baseline and every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Three out of 11 patients developed new-onset hypothyroidism during the treatment, and two of three patients had transient hyperthyroidism first. Two patients were diagnosed with Grade 2 hypothyroidism and received levothyroxine therapy. The other one was Grade 1 hypothyroidism and asymptomatic. All these three patients continued nivolumab therapy. CONCLUSION: Nivolumab-induced thyroid dysfunctions in advanced NSCLC were mostly mild and controlled.

With the increasing use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone or in combination with other therapies, awareness and management of irAEs have become more important. We aimed to assess the incidence and nature of irAEs associated with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors for NSCLC. METHODS: Articles from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched through December 2017. The incidence of overall and organ-specific irAEs was investigated in all clinical trials with nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolimumab, durvalumab, and avelumab as single agents for treatment of NSCLC. We calculated the pooled incidence using R software with package Meta. RESULTS: Sixteen trials were included in the meta-analysis: 10 trials with PD-1 inhibitors (3734 patients) and 6 trials with PD-L1 inhibitors (2474 patients). The overall incidence of irAEs was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17-28) for all grades and 4% (95% CI, 2-6) for high-grade irAEs. The frequency of irAEs varied based on drug type and organ, and patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors had an increased rate of any grade and high-grade irAEs compared with patients who received PD-L1 inhibitors. Organ-specific irAEs were most frequently observed in, in decreasing order, the endocrine system, skin, pulmonary tract, and gastrointestinal tract. The total number of patients whose death was attributed to irAEs was 14 (0.34%), and most (79%) of these patients died because of pneumonitis. The median time to the onset of irAEs after the initiation of treatment was 10 weeks (interquartile range, 6-19.5 weeks) and varied depending on the organ system involved. CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of irAEs was closely associated with the mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies involved in restarting anticancer immune attacks. Comprehensive understanding, timely detection, and effective management could improve the compliance of patients and guide the interruption of treatment."

Classical auto-immune side effects of these treatments, often called immune-related adverse events (irAEs), can affect multiple organs, including the lungs in which potentially life-threatening pneumonitis may require rapid treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. Nevertheless, the occurrence of severe infections in cancer patients treated with nivolumab, outside the context of immunosuppressive therapy, is a complication that has rarely been reported in the literature. Clinical cases: We report two cases of severe pulmonary infection with unusual microbes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Aspergillus fumigatus, in patients treated with nivolumab for non-small cell lung cancer. Conclusion: Ruling out pulmonary infections may require extensive investigation, as these may have an atypical presentation due to immunomodulation. Furthermore, treating the patient with corticosteroids for immune-related pneumonia could lead to a fatal outcome in this context. This report highlights the importance of excluding the presence of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis before considering immune-related pulmonary toxicity with or without a history of prior corticosteroid use. These cases also emphasize the potential value of tuberculosis screening in patients treated with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors."

However, there are currently no prospective studies evaluating PD-L1 expression for small biopsy samples. METHODS: To prospectively investigate the reliability of small samples for NSCLC, we included patients who underwent diagnostic biopsy by flexible bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT) and ultra-sonography (US) guided core-needle to determine the PD-L1 expression status. In pathologically confirmed NSCLC, PD-L1 expression was evaluated using companion diagnostic PD-L1 immunohistochemistry. We evaluated: 1) tumor cell count and sample size, 2) tumor proportion score (TPS): <1, 1-49%, 50%≦, and 3) the concordance rate of TPS by biopsy and surgical samples. RESULTS: Of the 153 cases of PD-L1 expression, 110 were assessed using endobronchial ultrasonography guided transbronchial biopsy (EBUS-TBB) (thin bronchoscopy 84 cases; normal bronchoscopy 26 cases), 23 were endobronchial ultrasonography guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), and 20 cases of CT or US-guided core-needle biopsy. Tumor cell count and sample size were significantly larger for normal bronchoscopy than thin bronchoscopy or EBUS-TBNA samples. Moreover, tumor cell counts for each subsequent biopsy decreased. In all cases, TPS distribution (undiagnosed, <1%, 1-49, 50%≦) was 2.6, 34.6, 31.4, 31.4%, respectively. TPS positive cases using thin bronchoscope was 55.9%, normal bronchoscope was 73.1% and EBUS-TBNA was 78.3%. In early stage adenocarcinoma, TPS was lower compared with advanced stages. Conversely, in squamous cell carcinoma, the rates of TPS were similar regardless of stage. The concordance rate of TPS by biopsy and surgical materials was 86.7%. CONCLUSION: Utilizing smaller samples for evaluation, the frequency of TPS was comparable to past clinical trials using larger samples. The differences in TPS were influenced by diagnostic tools, cancer histologic types and staging. The concordance of TPS between EBUS-TBB samples and surgical materials was high. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was performed at the Department of Respiratory Medicine at St. Marianna University School of Medicine Hospital, with ethics approval (3590) and registered as a clinical trial ( UMIN000027030 )."

Here, we show that baseline systemic CD4 immunity is a differential factor for clinical responses. Patients with functional systemic CD4 T cells included all objective responders and could be identified before the start of therapy by having a high proportion of memory CD4 T cells. In these patients, CD4 T cells possessed significant proliferative capacities, low co-expression of PD-1/LAG-3 and were responsive to PD-1 blockade ex vivo and in vivo In contrast, patients with dysfunctional systemic CD4 immunity did not respond even though they had lung cancer-specific T cells. Although proficient in cytokine production, CD4 T cells in these patients proliferated very poorly, strongly co-upregulated PD-1/LAG-3, and were largely refractory to PD-1 monoblockade. CD8 immunity only recovered in patients with functional CD4 immunity. T-cell proliferative dysfunctionality could be reverted by PD-1/LAG-3 co-blockade. Patients with functional CD4 immunity and PD-L1 tumor positivity exhibited response rates of 70%, highlighting the contribution of CD4 immunity for efficacious PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy.© 2019 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: We report the first case of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) in a patient treated with an anti-Programmed Death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Results: After a single dose of this drug the patient showed severe myositis associated with a high anti-PR3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titer. Discontinuation of the anti-PD-1 and introduction of corticoids led to a remission of the irAE. Regarding tumor a partial response was noted. A year later a neutrophilic, sterile pleural exudate and cutaneous lesions appeared with the pathological findings of neutrophilic vasculitis. Retreatment with corticoids induced a new remission of symptoms. It remains unclear whether GPA was preexisting and clinically silent but revealed by the use of ICI or primarily induced by this treatment. Conclusions: irAE are rare when anti-PD-1 antibodies are used in monotherapy. They present with a distinct clinical picture and temporal course and require specific treatment. Patients with irAE usually have a favorable oncological outcome."

Little evidence exists on the safety of resuming these treatments after an irAE. Objective: To investigate the safety of a rechallenge with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies after an irAE. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study of the safety of an ICI rechallenge involved consecutive adult patients (n = 93) who were referred to the ImmunoTOX assessment board at the Gustave Roussy cancer center in Villejuif, France, between August 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from May 28 to November 25, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of a second irAE in patients who had a readministration of an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 inhibitor after an initial grade 2 or higher irAE. Characteristics of the patients and the irAEs were reviewed, and the primary end point was the rate of occurrence of second irAEs. Results: A total of 93 patients were included, among whom 48 (52%) were female, and the median (range) age was 62.5 (33-85) years. The main cancer types or tumor sites were melanoma (31 [33%]), lung (15 [16%]), colorectal (8 [9%]), and lymphoma (8 [9%]). For the initial irAE, 43 grade 2 events (46%), 36 grade 3 events (39%), and 14 grade 4 events (15%) were found, presenting primarily as hepatitis (17 [18%]), skin toxic effect (14 [15%]), pneumonitis (13 [14%]), colitis (11 [12%]), or arthralgia (7 [7.5%]). Forty patients (43%) were rechallenged with the same anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agent. The rechallenged and non-rechallenged groups did not differ in terms of median (range) age (61 [34-84] years vs 63 [33-85] years; P = .37), time to initial irAE (5 [1-40] treatment cycles vs 3 [1-22] treatment cycles; P = .32), irAE severity (grade 2: 18 [47.5%] vs 27 [51%]; grades 3-4: 22 [52.5%] vs 26 [49%]; P = .70), or steroid use (17 [42.5%] vs 32 [60%]; P = .09). With a median follow-up period of 14 months, the same irAE or a different irAE occurred in 22 patients (55%). Shorter time to the initial irAE was linked to the occurrence of a second irAE (9 vs 15 weeks; P = .04). The second irAEs were not found to be more severe than the first. Conclusions and Relevance: The risk-reward ratio for an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 rechallenge appears to be acceptable, although these patients require close monitoring; further investigation into rechallenge conditions through a prospective clinical trial is needed."

The first patient was a 59-year old female diagnosed incidentally to have stage IIIA inoperable NSCLC that was treated with combination chemo-immunotherapy, and converted to operable disease with a negative PD-L1 in the postoperative setting. The second case is that of a 56-year old male that also had an inoperable stage IIIA NSCLC treated with chemotherapy first line followed by pembrolizumab at progression, then operated after surgical conversion, with negative PD-L1 postoperatively. In front of these findings, further work should be done to elucidate if the reverse of the PDL-1 status and the conversion to operability were due to the use of immunotherapy or to an incidental finding. If confirmed, it may have a therapeutic impact."

Sex-associated dimorphism in immune system response is acknowledged, but the effect of patients sex on efficacy of ICIs as treatment in NSCLC still remains controversial. The present study was conducted to investigate the difference in efficacy of NSCLC patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors according to the sex. A total of 9583 patients involved 6567 men and 3016 women with advanced lung cancer from 15 randomized controlled trials were included in this study. An overall survival (OS) benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors was illustrated in both male (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71-0.82) and female (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.91) patients, and a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was also found in both men (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.77) and women (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.95) in NSCLC. Both PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone and PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy significantly improved the OS and PFS in male patients. Whereas in females, PD-1 inhibitors or monotherapy significantly benefited the OS but not the PFS, PD-L1 inhibitors or combination therapy significantly prolonged the PFS but not the OS. No survival benefit was found in both male and female patients from the CTLA-4 inhibitors. The current study indicated that the magnitude of survival benefit is sex-dependent and male patients seemed to obtain more consistent and favorable outcomes from ICIs than women patients in NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

The direct interactions between inhibitory NK cell receptors and their HLA-I ligands enable NK cells to distinguish healthy from transformed cells, which frequently show an altered expression of HLA-I molecules. Indeed, NK cells can kill cancer cells that have lost, or under express, HLA-I molecules, but not cells maintaining their expression. In this last case, it is possible to use anti-KIR or anti-NKG2A monoclonal antibodies to block the inhibitory signals generated by these receptors and to restore the anti-tumor NK cell activity. These treatments fall within the context of the new immunotherapeutic strategies known as "immune checkpoint blockade." These antibodies are currently used in clinical trials in the treatment of both hematological and solid tumors. However, a more complex scenario has recently emerged. For example, NK cells can also express additional immune checkpoints, including PD-1, that was originally described on T lymphocytes, and whose ligands (PD-Ls) are usually overexpressed on tumor cells. Thus, it appears that the activation of NK cells and their potentially harmful effector functions are under the control of different immune checkpoints and their simultaneous expression could provide additional levels of suppression to anti-tumor NK cell responses. This review is focused on PD-1 immune checkpoint in NK cells, its potential role in immunosuppression, and the therapeutic strategies to recover NK cell cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effect."

Atezolizumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been shown to be superior to chemotherapy in patients with recurrent NSCLC. Recently, pembrolizumab has been combined with chemotherapy in the front-line setting and has demonstrated an improvement in overall survival in NSCLC patients as compared to chemotherapy alone. In this review we will focus on the clinical trials that led to approval of combination pembrolizumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC as well as discuss other combinations of immunotherapy and chemotherapy that have also been evaluated."

We describe a case of nivolumab induced thrombocytopenia after transient mild fever. A 77-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer was administered nivolumab (240 mg/body, every 2 weeks) as second line therapy. On the day 2 after the first nivolumab infusion, he had a fever and his C-reactive protein level was elevated. Thoracic computed tomography revealed no interstitial lung disease or pneumonia. The fever resolved on day 9 and was not seen thereafter. On day 15 after the first nivolumab infusion, severe thrombocytopenia suddenly emerged. A bone marrow examination revealed no dysplasia or invasion. Based on the presence of high platelet-associated IgG titer, normal bone marrow plasticity and a lack of effectiveness of platelet infusion, we diagnosed nivolumab-induced immune thrombocytopenia. Daily administration of 60 mg of prednisolone restored the patients platelet count and platelet-associated IgG. We also found that there was significant shrinkage of the primary lesion and that stable disease was achieved. One must be aware of this relatively rare side effect and the unusual clinical findings that could be associated with immunoreaction."

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), improved understanding of PD-1 checkpoint blockade-responsive biology and identification of biomarkers for prediction of a clinical response to immunotherapy is warranted. Thus, in the present study, we systematically described PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression correlated genes in NSCLC. METHODS: We performed comparative retrospective analyses to identify PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression correlated genes in NSCLC. For this, we examined available datasets from the cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE) project lung non-small-cell (Lung_NSC) and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) projects lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). RESULTS: Analysis of the CCLE dataset Lung_NSC identified expression correlation between PD-L1 and PD-L2. Moreover, we identified expression correlation between 489 genes and PD-L1, 191 genes and PD-L2, and 111 genes for both. PD-L1 and PD-L2 also expression correlated in TCGA datasets LUAD and LUSC. In LUAD, we identified expression correlation between 257 genes and PD-L1, 914 genes and PD-L2, and 211 genes for both. In LUSC, we identified expression correlation between 26 genes and PD-L1, 326 genes and PD-L2, and 13 genes for both. Only a few genes expression correlated with PD-L1 and PD-L2 across the CCLE and TCGA datasets. Expression of Interferon signaling-involved genes converged in particular with the expression correlated genes for PD-L1 in Lung_NSC, for PD-L2 in LUSC, and for both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in LUAD. In LUSC, PD-L1, and to a lesser extent PD-L2, expression correlated with chromosome 9p24 localized genes, indicating a chromosome 9p24 topologically associated domain as an important driver of in particular LUSC PD-L1 expression. Expression correlation analyses of the PD-L1 and PD-L2 receptors programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), Cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80), and Repulsive guidance molecule B (RGMB) showed that PD-1 and CD80 expression correlated with both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in LUAD. CD80 expression correlated with PD-L2 in LUSC. CONCLUSIONS: We present gene signatures associated with PD-L1 and PD-L2 mRNA expression in NSCLC which could possess importance in relation to understand PD-1 checkpoint blockade-responsive biology and development of gene signature based biomarkers for predicting clinical responses to immunotherapy."

Immunohistochemical staining was performed to investigate the expression levels of natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) ligands, programmed cell death‑1 ligand 1 (PD‑L1), and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)‑class I in tissue samples collected from 10 NSCLC patients who received platinum‑based chemotherapy followed by surgery. Additionally, the effects of repeated exposure to cisplatin on the expression of NKG2D ligands, PD‑L1 and HLA‑class I in NSCLC cell lines were assessed by flow cytometry. We found upregulation of PD‑L1 or downregulation of NKG2D ligands in 5 of the 10 NSCLC cases, leading to the attenuation of NK cell‑mediated tumor cell death. Moreover, upregulation of PD‑L1 or downregulation of HLA‑class I were observed in 6 cases, supporting tumor escape from T cell immunity. An in vitro assay showed that repeated exposure to cisplatin enhanced the expression of PD‑L1 and NKG2D ligands in NSCLC cell lines. Notably, interferon gamma (IFNγ) stimuli enhanced PD‑L1 expression while attenuated that of NKG2D ligands in NSCLC cell lines, which mimicked the results of the clinical study. Both IFNγ‑induced upregulation of PD‑L1 and downregulation of NKG2D ligands were blocked by the JAK‑STAT inhibitor tofacitinib. These findings suggested that the expression levels of NKG2D ligands, PD‑L1 and HLA‑class I in residual tumors after chemotherapy were affected by host immunity, resulting in an immunoescape phenotype. Blocking IFNγ‑induced tumor immunoescape by a JAK‑STAT inhibitor might be a promising treatment strategy for NSCLC."

However, patients with HIV were excluded from most registered trials. Objective: The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in people with HIV and advanced cancer; the secondary objective was to evaluate tumor responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, nonrandomized, phase 1 multicenter study conducted at 7 Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network sites. Patients with HIV and advanced cancer as well as a CD4 count greater than or equal to 100 cells/μL, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 4 or more weeks, and an HIV viral load of less than 200 copies/mL were eligible. Exclusion criteria included uncontrolled hepatitis B or C infection, active immunosuppressive therapy, or a history of autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy. Interventions: Pembrolizumab, 200 mg, administered intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 doses in 3 CD4 count-defined cohorts. Participants continued ART. Main Outcomes and Measures: Safety and tolerability were assessed using current NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Immune-related adverse events grade 2 or higher were considered immune-related events of clinical interest (irECI). Tumor responses were evaluated using standard tumor-specific criteria. Results: Thirty participants (28 men and 2 women; median [range] age, 57 [39-77] years) were enrolled from April 2016 through March 2018; 6 had Kaposi sarcoma (KS), 5 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 19 had non-AIDS-defining cancers. Safety was observed over 183 cycles of treatment with pembrolizumab. Most treatment-emergent adverse events at least possibly attributed to pembrolizumab were grade 1 or 2 (n = 22), and 20% (n = 6) were grade 3. The irECI included hypothyroidism (6 participants), pneumonitis (3 participants), rash (2 participants), an elevated aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase level (1 participant), and a musculoskeletal event (1 participant). One participant with pretreatment KS herpesvirus (KSHV) viremia developed a polyclonal KSHV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation and died. HIV was controlled in all participants. Increases in CD4 count were not statistically significant (median increase, 19 cells/μL; P = .18). Best tumor responses included complete response (lung, 1 patient), partial response (NHL, 2 patients), stable disease for 24 weeks or more (KS, 2 patients), stable disease for less than 24 weeks (15 patients), and progressive disease (8 patients); 2 patients were not evaluable. Conclusions and Relevance: Pembrolizumab has acceptable safety in patients with cancer, HIV treated with ART, and a CD4+ T-cell count of greater than 100 cells/μL but may be associated with KSHV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation. Clinical benefit was noted in lung cancer, NHL, and KS. Anti-PD-1 therapy is appropriate for US Food and Drug Administration-approved indications and clinical trials in this population.

Because IR blockade has led to clinical responses in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we investigated how IRs influenced CD8+ TIL function from freshly digested early-stage NSCLC tissues using a killing assay and intracellular cytokine staining after in vitro T-cell restimulation. Early-stage lung cancer TIL function was heterogeneous with only about one third of patients showing decrements in cytokine production and lytic function. TIL hypofunction did not correlate with clinical factors, coexisting immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, or CD4+ T regulatory cells), nor with PD-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, CD39, or CTLA-4 expression. Instead, we found that the presence of the integrin αeβ7 (CD103), characteristic of tissue-resident memory cells (TRM), was positively associated with cytokine production, whereas expression of the transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) was negatively associated with TIL function. These data suggest that the functionality of CD8+ TILs from early-stage NSCLCs may be influenced by competition between an antitumor CD103+ TRM program and an exhaustion program marked by Eomes expression.

We previously reported that FXR expression promotes tumor cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we study the relevance of FXR to the immune microenvironment of NSCLC. We found an inverse correlation between FXR and PD-L1 expression in a cohort of 408 NSCLC specimens; from this, we identified a subgroup of FXRhighPD-L1low patients. We showed that FXR downregulates PD-L1 via transrepression and other mechanisms in NSCLC. Cocultured with FXRhighPD-L1low NSCLC cell lines, effector function and proliferation of CD8+ T cell in vitro are repressed. We also detected downregulation of PD-L1 in FXR-overexpressing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) mouse syngeneic models, indicating an FXRhighPD-L1low subtype in which FXR suppresses tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Anti-PD-1 therapy was effective against FXRhighPD-L1low mouse LLC tumors. Altogether, our findings demonstrate an immunosuppressive role for FXR in the FXRhighPD-L1low NSCLC subtype and provide translational insights into therapeutic response in PD-L1low NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1.

Treatment with selective anti-PD1, anti-PD-L1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been a revolution in the therapeutic scenario of several cancer types, with the highest clinical efficacy in melanoma and in lung cancer. Colorectal cancer is one of the tumours in which immunotherapy has been shown less effective. Whereas in deficient mismatch repair (MMR) or in highly microsatellite instable (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer there is clear clinical evidence for a therapeutic role of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the vast majority of patients with proficient MMR or with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours do not benefit from immunotherapy. Defining the molecular mechanisms for immunogenicity in metastatic colorectal cancer is needed in order to develop predictive biomarkers and effective therapeutic combination strategies. A major challenge will be to identify, among the heterogeneous spectrum of this disease, those patients with specific tumour and tumour infiltrating stroma molecular and functional characteristics, that could be effectively treated with immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the role of immune response in the context of metastatic colorectal cancer. We summarize the available clinical data with the use of anti PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs as single agents or in combination with anti CTLA-4 mAbs in MSI-H patients. Finally, we address the challenges and the potential strategies for rendering the more frequent microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours immune-competent and, therefore, amenable for effective immunotherapy interventions."

The use of traditional chemotherapy and new immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICIs) directed at programmed cell-death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand has led to unprecedented survival benefits in selected patients with metastatic UC. Data show that anti-PD-1 ICIs are not only improving long-term clinical benefit, but also quality of life for patients in the second-line setting. In the front-line setting, regulatory agencies have restricted the indications of atezolizumab and pembrolizumab (both ICIs) to patients with PD-L1positivity with advanced UC and who are platinum-ineligible. Very recently, erdafitinib, a pan-FGFR inhibitor, has been granted accelerated approval by FDA for platinum-pretreated advanced metastatic UC with susceptible FGFR3 or FGFR2 genetic alterations. Enfortumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate, have been granted breakthrough designation by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic UC.

Immunotherapy agents including the anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand-1 inhibitor therapies have unique symptomatic side effects and patient-reported outcome data can help to characterize the benefits and burdens associated with therapy. METHODS: We reviewed registration trials in the Food and Drug Administration database for five anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand-1 inhibitor therapies to characterize trial design and patient-reported outcome assessment strategy (cutoff 31 December 2017). We evaluated the patient-reported outcome measurement coverage of eight key symptoms related to adverse events reported in immunotherapy agent product labels (fatigue, diarrhea, cough, shortness of breath, musculoskeletal pain, rash, pruritus, and fever). RESULTS: There were a total of 28 trials across seven disease types and one tumor agnostic indication reviewed, of which 17 were randomized and 25 were open label. Of the 28 trials, 21 contained patient-reported outcome measures and all 21 used >1 instrument. The most common instruments were the EuroQol five dimension (N = 19), and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (N = 17). Disease-specific patient-reported outcome tools were included in nine trials (six lung, one head and neck, one melanoma and one renal cell). No trial used a patient-reported outcome strategy assessing all eight selected adverse events. CONCLUSION: Collection of patient-reported outcome data in anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand-1 inhibitor trials were variable and did not consistently assess important symptomatic adverse events. Use of a patient-reported outcome instrument with well-defined functional scales supplemented by item libraries to incorporate relevant symptomatic adverse events may allow for improved understanding of the patient experience while receiving therapy.

Here, for a case with a binary outcome, we propose that the covariate effect type should be assessed in terms of four types of potential responses: activated- (always-), inert- (never-), causative-, and preventive-responder. METHODS: We introduce a new concept of covariate effect types differing from the commonly used "prediction" and "prognosis." We summarize the covariate effect types by inspecting the proportions of subjects in each response type in two subgroups of a covariate, and indicate whether the fractions are augmented, depleted, or neutral as one changes the level of the covariate. Although these proportions cannot generally be identified, we can derive the posterior distributions of the proportions by applying a recently developed Bayesian method. On the basis of the distributions, we would say that the covariate is "augmented-causative" if the difference between the proportions of causative-responders (who would respond if they received the treatment but would not if they did not) in two subgroups is positive, rather than that it is predictive. Similarly, we would say that the covariate is "neutral-activated" if the difference in the proportion of activated-responders (who would respond regardless of their randomized treatment assignment) is close to zero, rather than saying that the covariate is not prognostic. We further describe the relationship between our approach and standard subgroup analysis. RESULTS: We applied our approach to data from a randomized clinical trial comparing nivolumab and docetaxel for subjects with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer; we assessed the covariate effect type of PD-L1 status, where PD-L1 is a ligand of the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor expressed by activated T cells. When the endpoint was the overall response rate, the posterior distributions for the differences between the proportions of subjects in response types in the PD-L1-positive and negative subgroups yielded an expected-a-posteriori estimate of 0.243 (95% credible interval (CI): 0.094, 0.374) for causative-responders and 0.014 (95% CI: -0.087, 0.125) for activated-responders. Thus, PD-L1 status was augmented-causative for nivolumab effectiveness, to an extent of 24.3%, and was neutral-activated. CONCLUSION: Our approach characterizes the covariate effect types in terms of the response types, and to what extent. In a randomized clinical trial with a binary outcome, our approach is a potentially valuable addition to standard subgroup or regression analysis."

Unfortunately, many tumors will acquire resistance and >75% of NSCLC cases lack for an actionable gene aberration. In this setting, immunotherapy rises as effective therapeutic where immune checkpoint inhibitors have entered or are entering the market in many neoplasms, including NSCLC. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA-4, promoting T-cell activation and its subsequent anti-tumoral immune effect. Ipilimumab might have a very important role in NSCLC as it does in melanoma because of its synergistic effect with PD-1/PDL-1 inhibitors. Areas covered: We summarize current results of clinical studies of ipilimumab for efficacy and safety in NSCLC and also the current knowledge about potential biomarkers for its efficacy. Expert Opinion: Combined use of PD-1/PDL-1 and anti-CTL4 inhibitors increases the efficacy against NSCLC and it is a very promising approach not only in NSCLC but also in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for first or second-line therapy. Its very important to identify biomarkers that can better select the population of patients that benefit the most with these checkpoint inhibitors."

Patients & methods: Clinical and radiological data were collected from pneumonitis cases reported during/after nivolumab treatment for melanoma or non-small-cell lung cancer. The expert central review committee evaluated each case. Results: Among 144 cases analyzed, 91 (63.2%) had radiological patterns considered typical for drug-induced pneumonitis and 53 (36.8%) patients had previously unobserved patterns with one or more atypical features, including 23 cases (16.0%) with ground glass opacity confined to the area around the tumor (peritumoral infiltration). A higher proportion of patients with (vs without) peritumoral infiltration had an antitumor response to nivolumab. Conclusion: Images of nivolumab-induced pneumonitis showed previously unobserved radiological patterns."

Results: A total of 51 patients were included in the analysis. Most single parameters failed to reflect treatment benefit. Three laboratory parameters (lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) combined in a weighted score could predict benefit with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a hazard ratio of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.16-0.59) in an early phase of therapy. Sorting patients by score showed a 1-year survival of 36% in those predicted as not benefitting versus 68% in those predicted to benefit.

METHODS: We studied 19 Japanese patients with PD-1 myopathy (13 men and 6 women, mean age 70 years), who were referred to Keio University. As control groups, we used 68 patients with anti-signal recognition particle antibodies, 51 patients with anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase antibodies and 460 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In regard to muscle-disease severity, 10 patients showed a mild form of disease and 9 patients showed a severe form. Non-small cell lung cancer was the most common underlying cancer. PD-1 inhibitor consisted of 11 nivolumab and 8 pembrolizumab. PD-1 myopathy occurred 29 days on average after the first administration of PD-1 inhibitor. The initial manifestation of muscle weakness was ptosis in 10 patients, 15 patients had ptosis, 13 diplopia, 8 facial muscle weakness, 10 bulbar symptoms, 13 limb weakness, 14 neck weakness, 4 cardiac involvement, 6 respiratory involvement and 16 myalgia. Ocular, facial, cardiac and respiratory involvement and myalgia were more frequently observed than controls. Serum creatine kinase was increased to 5247 IU/L on average. Autoantibodies related to inflammatory myopathy were negative, while anti-striational antibodies were found in 13 (68%) patients. HLA-C*12:02 alleles were more frequently detected than healthy controls. Muscle pathology was characterized by multifocal necrotic myofibers with endomysial inflammation and expression of MHC class I. Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids was generally effective for muscle weakness. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our clinical, histological and immunological findings, PD-1 myopathy is a discrete subset of inflammatory myopathy."

However, because such trials comprise cohorts selected based on specific criteria, it is unclear if their results represent routine clinical practice. METHODS: We examined 155 patients with advanced NSCLC who were administered either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Yonsei Cancer Center, Korea between March 2014 and January 2019. Patient characteristics, EGFR/ALK mutation status, metastatic locations, response to ICIs, and adverse events were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 64 years and 72.9% of patients were male; former or current smokers constituted 67.1% of the subjects. Adenocarcinoma was predominant (67.7%), and 50.3% of the patients underwent ≥ 2 previous treatments. Twenty-three patients (14.8%) were EGFR mutation- or ALK rearrangement-positive. The objective response rate (ORR) was 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.4-31.4%]; the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.06 (95% CI 1.893-4.21) and 10.25 (95% CI 5.39-15.11) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified ECOG performance status, EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement status, liver metastasis and PD-L1 proportion as independent predictors of OS. Furthermore, 61.9% of the patients had adverse events of any grade; 38.1% had immune-related adverse events that were associated with PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world ORR, PFS, OS, and adverse event profiles were comparable to previous clinical trials despite the patients different baseline characteristics. Our findings can aid in establishing effective immunotherapeutic management of NSCLC in routine clinical practice."

Approximately 30% to 35% of patients with NSCLC possess inactivated liver kinase B1 gene (LKB1), and these patients respond poorly to anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy. Therefore, novel therapies targeting NSCLC with LKB1 loss are needed. METHODS: We used a new in silico signaling analysis method to identify the potential therapeutic targets and reposition drugs by integrating gene expression data with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways. LKB1 wild-type and LKB1-deficient NSCLC cell lines, including knockout clones generated by clustered regularly interspaced short pallindromic repeats-Cas9, were treated with inhibitors of mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and a dual inhibitor. RESULTS: In silico experiments showed that inhibition of both mTOR and PI3K can be synergistically effective in LKB1-deficient NSCLC. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed the synergistic effect of mTOR inhibition and PI3K inhibition in LKB1-mutant NSCLC cell lines. The sensitivity to dual inhibition of mTOR and PI3K is higher in LKB1-mutant cell lines than in wild-type cell lines. A higher compensatory increase in Akt phosphorylation after rapamycin treatment of LKB1-deficient cells than after rapamycin treatment of LKB1 wild-type cells is responsible for the synergistic effect of mTOR and PI3K inhibition. Dual inhibition of mTOR and PI3K resulted in a greater decrease in protein expression of cell cycle-regulating proteins in LKB1 knockout cells than in LKB1 wild-type cells. CONCLUSION: Dual molecular targeted therapy for mTOR and PI3K may be a promising therapeutic strategy in the specific population of patients with lung cancer with LKB1 loss."

METHODS: Trp53FloxFlox;KrasG12D/+;Rosa26LSL-Luciferase/LSL-Luciferase (PKL) genetically engineered mice were used to develop autochthonous lung tumors with intratracheal delivery of adenoviral Cre recombinase. Using these tumor-bearing lungs, tumor-infiltrating immune cells were characterized by both mass cytometry and flow cytometry. PKL-mediated immunocompetent syngeneic and transgenic lung cancer mouse models were treated with MEKi alone as well as in combination with either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAbs. Tumor growth and survival outcome were assessed. Finally, immune cell populations within spleens and tumors were evaluated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were significantly augmented in PKL-driven lung tumors compared to normal lungs of tumor-free mice. PD-L1 expression appeared to be highly positive in both lung tumor cells and, particularly MDSCs. The combinatory administration of MEKi with either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAbs synergistically increased antitumor response and survival outcome compared with single-agent therapy in both the PKL-mediated syngeneic and transgenic lung cancer models. Theses combinational treatments resulted in significant increases of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, whereas attenuation of CD11b+/Gr-1high MDSCs, in particular, Ly6Ghigh polymorphonuclear-MDSCs in the syngeneic model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic approach for untargetable Kras/p53-driven lung cancers with synergy between targeted therapy using MEKi and immunotherapies."

We hypothesized that TP53 mutations could reflect TMB and be associated with ICI benefit. METHODS: TP53 mutations were assessed by next-generation sequencing in aNSCLC patients treated with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockers. Clinical data, tumor programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, and KRAS mutational status were collected. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In total, 72 patients (median [interquartile range] age: 61 [33-83] years) were included; 52 (72%) were male; 39 (54%) had performance status 0-1; 53 (74%) had adenocarcinoma; 20 (28%) received first-line ICI, 52 (72%) second line or more. In 65 patients with available data, 36 (55%) expressed PD-L1 in ≥50% of tumor cells, 20 (31%) in 1-49% of cells, and nine (14%) were PD-L1-negative. Non-synonymous TP53 mutations were observed in 41 (57%) and 25 (35%) harbored KRAS-mutated tumors. After a median follow-up of 15.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.3-17.4 m), the median OS in the TP53-mutated group was 18.1 months (95% CI 6.6-not reached), vs. 8.1 months (95% CI 2.2-14.5, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.95, p = 0.04) in the TP53-wild-type group. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in TP53-mutated patients (4.5 months, 95% CI 2.8-18.1 versus 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; p = 0.03), although TP53 mutation status failed to significantly influence PFS in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.32). Objective response rate (ORR) was higher in patients with TP53 mutation (51.2% vs. 20.7%; p = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, TP53 mutations independently associated with longer OS (HR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.77, p = 0.009).

We evaluated serum proteins relevant to immune checkpoint blockade in patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab to identify novel non-invasive predictive biomarkers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC, who had failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, received nivolumab monotherapy (3 mg/kg, Q2W) until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity was observed. Blood samples were collected at baseline and week 4. Fifty-seven serum protein levels were quantified with a Milliplex MAP assay. The associations of both clinical benefit (CB) and the onset of immune related adverse events (irAEs) with serum proteins levels were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled in the study, with 38 and 32 paired serum samples at baseline and week 4 being available for efficacy analysis and irAE analysis, respectively. In durable CB (DCB) patients compared with non-DCB patients, the baseline serum levels of BMP-9 were significantly higher, whereas the follistatin, IL-8, IP-10, and TNF-α levels were significantly lower. In irAE patients compared with non-irAE patients the serum levels of G-CSF and RANTES at week 4 were significantly higher, whereas the levels of leptin were significantly lower. A multivariate analysis revealed that follistatin and IP-10 were statistically associated with DCB (p < 0.05) and RANTES was associated with irAE onset (p < 0.05). In a subset of irAE-developed patients, RANTES levels decreased after steroid administration, supporting its involvement in irAE. CONCLUSION: Serum proteins have the potential to be predictive markers for DCB and irAEs onset in patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab. In addition, antitumor activity and irAEs may not be regulated by the same mechanisms."

Immunological checkpoint inhibitors improve the overall survival of patients with expression of PD-L1; however certain PD-L1-negative patients may also benefit from immunotherapy. This indicates the requirement for novel predictive factors for the qualification of immunotherapy. It is also necessary to understand the mechanisms that effect the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells. The expression of PD-L1 in 47 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, NSCLC specimens was assessed using IHC and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The expression of 8 microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) complementary to PD-L1-mRNA was also evaluated using RT-qPCR. A positive correlation was revealed between the expression level of PD-L1-mRNA and 2 miRs, miR-141 (R=0.533; P=0.0029) and miR-1184 (R=0.463; P=0.049). There was also a positive correlation between the percentage of PD-L1-positive tumor cells and the expression levels of miR-141 (R=0.441; P=0.0024), miR-200b (R=0.372; P=0.011) and miR-429 (R=0.430; P=0.0028), and between the percentage of the tumor area with immune cell infiltration and the expression levels of miR-141 (R=0.333; P=0.03) and miR-200b (R=0.312; P=0.046). Additionally, the percentage of tumor cells expressing PD-L1 positively correlated with miR-141 expression (R=0.407; P=0.0055).

These CPIs have been identified to have an effective therapeutic response, particularly in tumors with high tumor mutation burden. Targeting private somatic mutations encoding immunogenic neoantigens (neo-Ags) has been developed as an autologous gene therapy. T-cell receptor-engineered T cells targeting neo-Ags are a novel option for adoptive cell therapy used for the treatment of lung cancer. However, not all patients experience an effective response from immunotherapy. Although the resistance mechanism of CPIs has been reported, its association with other treatment methods during systemic anticancer therapy remains unclear, particularly the treatment options following the emergence of drug resistance in lung cancer. The potential biomarkers used for liquid biopsy may assist in the identification of patients who would benefit the most from immunotherapy. Attempts to identify potential biomarkers for predicting clinical response to immunotherapy are underway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 patients with NSCLC with ctDNA testing were retrospectively evaluated from a single institution, along with a validation cohort from a second institution. ctDNA TMB was derived using the number of detected mutations over the DNA sequencing length. RESULTS: Higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with smoking history (p < .05, chi-squared test). Among patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (n = 20), higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with shorter progressive free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 45 vs. 355 days; hazard ratio [HR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-24.6; p < .01, and OS 106 days vs. not reached; HR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.3-27.1; p < .01, respectively). In a small independent validation cohort (n = 12), there was a nonsignificant numerical difference for higher ctDNA TMB predicting shorter OS but not PFS. ctDNA TMB was not correlated with RECIST tumor burden estimation in the subset of patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that higher ctDNA TMB, at the current commercial sequencing length, reflects worse clinical outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Biomarkers to identify patients who will respond to immune checkpoint blockade are critical. Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a viable biomarker to predict response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, but few studies have explored the meaning and potential clinical significance of noninvasive, blood-based TMB.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with advanced cancer, treated with anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) agents, were evaluated according to the presence of pre-existing AIDs. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and clinical outcomes were compared among subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 751 patients were enrolled; median age was 69 years. Primary tumors were as follows: non-small cell lung cancer, 492 (65.5%); melanoma, 159 (21.2%); kidney cancer, 94 (12.5%); and others, 6 (0.8%). Male/female ratio was 499/252. Eighty-five patients (11.3%) had pre-existing AIDs, further differentiated in clinically active (17.6%) and inactive (82.4%). Among patients with pre-existing AIDs, incidence of irAEs of any grade was significantly higher when compared with patients without AIDs (65.9% vs. 39.9%). At multivariate analysis, both inactive (p = .0005) and active pre-existing AIDs (p = .0162), female sex (p = .0004), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status <2 (p = .0030) were significantly related to a higher incidence of irAEs of any grade. No significant differences were observed regarding grade 3/4 irAEs and objective response rate among subgroups. Pre-existing AIDs were not significantly related with progression-free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSION: This study quantifies the increased risk of developing irAEs in patients with pre-existing AIDs who had to be treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the incidence of grade 3/4 irAEs is not significantly higher when compared with control population. The finding of a greater incidence of irAEs among female patients ranks among the "hot topics" in gender-related differences in immuno-oncology. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Patients with a history of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) have not usually been included in clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors but are frequent in clinical practice. This study quantifies the increased risk of developing immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with pre-existing AIDs who had to be treated with anti-programmed death-1 immunotherapy. Nevertheless, their toxicities are mild and the incidence of grade 3/4 irAEs is not significantly higher compared with those of controls.

Higher percentages of PD-1+ , CD137+ and PD-1+ CD137+ amongst CD8+ T cells were observed in lung cancer patients compared with HCs. The percentages of CD137+ CD8+ and PD-1+ CD137+ CD8+ T cell subsets amongst CD8+ T cells were positively correlated with thoracic tumour burden and were strongly positively correlated with the percentage of effector Treg subset. Smoking patients harboured higher percentages of the PD-1+ CD8+ T cell subset compared with non-smoking patients. This study demonstrated that circulating antigen-activated CD8+ T cells accumulated in lung cancer patients along with increased effector Treg and thoracic tumour burden. These findings aid a better understanding of immune-host interactions in lung cancer patients using peripheral blood, and further support immunotherapeutic intervention strategies using combination therapy for differential control of Treg and activation of tumour-specific effector T cells.© 2019 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology."

However, there is limited information about potential overlapping toxicity of anti-PD-1 antibodies administered after TRT. Herein, we report three cases. The first case was of a man in his 80s with squamous cell lung cancer (cT2aN0M0 stage IB). Twelve months after TRT, tumor regrowth was observed, and the patient was administered nivolumab. Twenty-four months after TRT, computed tomography (CT) showed organizing pneumonia (OP). The second case was of a man in his 70s with squamous cell lung cancer. He underwent surgery for pT3N1M0 stage IIIA; however, mediastinum lymph node metastasis developed. Therefore, he received TRT for the mediastinum lymph node metastasis. One month after the completion of TRT, nivolumab was administered. Two months after TRT, an OP diagnosis was made. The third case was of a man in his 60s with an unknown type of lung cancer. He received TRT for cT4N2M0 stage IIIB. Fourteen months after TRT, tumor regrowth was observed, thus, nivolumab was administered. Twenty-seven months after TRT, an OP diagnosis was made. These case reports draw attention to OP after TRT and anti-PD-1 antibody administration despite low V20.

Precious therapeutic weapons impacting survival are monoclonal antibodies directed against the programmed death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint. Areas covered: Unfortunately, not all patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors have durable clinical responses. However, a better understanding of the complexity of interactions between the immune system and cancer, the latter capable of adopting evasion mechanisms, indicates different opportunities to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Expert opinion: In this paper, we review multiple strategies of combining immunotherapies that exploit not only additional immune checkpoint receptors and ligands but also other synergistic approaches such as vaccines or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors with the potential to extend the number of NSCLC patients achieving successful outcomes."

These immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improved the overall survival of a variety of cancer such as malignant melanoma and non-small lung cancer. In addition, numerous clinical trials for additional indication of ICIs including adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapies are also currently ongoing. Therefore, more and more patients will receive ICIs in the future. However, despite the improved outcome of the cancer treatment by ICIs, the efficacy remains still limited and tumor regression have not been obtained in many cancer patients. In addition, treatment with ICIs is also associated with substantial toxicities, described as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Therefore, biomarkers to predict tumor response and occurrence of irAEs by the treatment with ICIs are required to avoid overtreatment of ICIs and minimize irAEs development. Whereas, numerous factors have been reported as potential biomarkers for tumor response to ICIs, factors for predicting irAE have been less reported. In this review, we show recent advances in the understanding of biomarkers for tumor response and occurrence of irAEs in cancer patients treated with ICIs."

Recent case studies have suggested the association between immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and the disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system, implying that systemic immune activation may impact a balance between clotting and bleeding. However, little is known about the association of coagulation-fibrinolysis system disorder with the efficacy of ICIs. We retrospectively evaluated 83 lung cancer patients who received ICI at Kumamoto University Hospital. The association between clinical outcome and diseases associated with disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system was assessed along with tumor PD-L1 expression. Among 83 NSCLC patients, total 10 patients (12%) developed diseases associated with the disorder of coagulation-fibrinolysis system. We found that disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system occurred in patients with high PD-L1 expression and in the early period of ICI initiation. In addition, high tumor responses (72%) were observed, including two complete responses among these patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate T-cell activation strongly induces production of a primary initiator of coagulation, tissue factor in peripheral PD-L1high monocytes, in vitro. This study suggests a previously unrecognized pivotal role for immune activation in triggering disorders of the coagulation-fibrinolysis system in cancer patients during treatment with ICI."

In oncology, tumor-based Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) endpoints are standard clinical trial metrics. The best approach for collecting similar endpoints from EHRs remains unknown. We evaluated the feasibility of a RECIST-based methodology to assess EHR-derived real-world progression (rwP) and explored non-RECIST-based approaches. METHODS: In this retrospective study, cohorts were randomly selected from Flatiron Healths database of de-identified patient-level EHR data in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. A RECIST-based approach tested for feasibility (N = 26). Three non-RECIST approaches were tested for feasibility, reliability, and validity (N = 200): (1) radiology-anchored, (2) clinician-anchored, and (3) combined. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used. RESULTS: A RECIST-based approach was not feasible: cancer progression could be ascertained for 23% (6/26 patients). Radiology- and clinician-anchored approaches identified at least one rwP event for 87% (173/200 patients). rwP dates matched 90% of the time. In 72% of patients (124/173), the first clinician-anchored rwP event was accompanied by a downstream event (e.g., treatment change); the association was slightly lower for the radiology-anchored approach (67%; 121/180). Median overall survival (OS) was 17 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 14, 19]. Median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) was 5.5 months (95% CI 4.6, 6.3) and 4.9 months (95% CI 4.2, 5.6) for clinician-anchored and radiology-anchored approaches, respectively. Correlations between rwPFS and OS were similar across approaches (Spearmans rho 0.65-0.66). Abstractors preferred the clinician-anchored approach as it provided more comprehensive context. CONCLUSIONS: RECIST cannot adequately assess cancer progression in EHR-derived data because of missing data and lack of clarity in radiology reports. We found a clinician-anchored approach supported by radiology report data to be the optimal, and most practical, method for characterizing tumor-based endpoints from EHR-sourced data.

[Epub ahead of print]","Current status of immune checkpoint inhibition in early stage NSCLC.","Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) immunotherapy has revolutionized the approach to metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, antibodies blocking the inhibitory immune checkpoints programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are associated with higher response rates, improved overall survival and better tolerability as compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Recently, ICI has moved from the second-line to the first-line setting for many patients with non-oncogene addicted NSCLC, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The next logical step is to examine this therapy in patients with non-metastatic NSCLC to improve long-term overall survival and cure rates. For patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, ICI with durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy has brought a major improvement in 2-year progression-free and overall survival, which holds promise for an improved cure rate. As the relapse pattern in patients with completely resected early stage NSCLC is predominantly systemic, high expectations rest on the integration of ICI therapy in their treatment approach. A large number of studies with adjuvant or neo-adjuvant ICI are ongoing, and will be discussed here. The advent of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has brought a valid alternative treatment for patients unfit for or not willing to undergo surgery. Data on combining systemic therapy and SABR is virtually non-existent, but there is a strong biological rationale to combine radiotherapy and ICI therapy. Early findings in small feasibility studies are promising and now need to be explored in well-designed phase III trials.© The Author 2019.

We previously observed differential responses of two murine K-Ras-mutant lung cancer cell lines to anti-PD-1 therapy: CMT167 tumors were eliminated, whereas Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumors were resistant. The goal of this study was to define mechanism(s) mediating this difference. RNA sequencing analysis of cancer cells recovered from lung tumors revealed that CMT167 cells induced an IFNγ signature that was blunted in LLC cells. Silencing Ifngr1 in CMT167 resulted in tumors resistant to IFNγ and anti-PD-1 therapy. Conversely, LLC cells had high basal expression of SOCS1, an inhibitor of IFNγ. Silencing Socs1 increased response to IFNγ in vitro and sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1. This was associated with a reshaped tumor microenvironment, characterized by enhanced T cell infiltration and enrichment of PD-L1hi myeloid cells. These studies demonstrate that targeted enhancement of tumor-intrinsic IFNγ signaling can induce a cascade of changes associated with increased therapeutic vulnerability.© 2019 Bullock et al."

Previously it was reported that platinum-based chemotherapy may change PD-L1 expression in solid cancers. However, no reports addressing alteration of PD-L1 expression after ICI therapy in NSCLC are available so far. The patients were Japanese males 83 and 87 years old, who were diagnosed with NSCLC based on the transbronchial lung biopsies showing sarcomatoid feature with high PD-L1 expression. They received Pembrolizumab, however, passed away with disease progression on day 27 and day 9, respectively. PD-L1, PD1, and CD8 antibodies were applied to pretreatment tumor biopsies and autopsy specimens. Immunoexpression of all the markers was evaluated using Aperio ImageScope. We found that PD-L1 expression decreased significantly from 75.6% to 13.2% and from 100% to 58.8%, in patients 1 and 2, respectively. This alteration was less prominent in the perinecrotic tumor area. A considerable decrease of PD-L1 score was linked with a little effect of Pembrolizumab in our patients. This association might be one of the contributing mechanisms of resistance to ICI and needs further investigation in large-scale studies."

The activity of ICI across NSCLC harboring oncogenic alterations is poorly characterized. The aim of our study was to address the efficacy of ICI in the context of oncogenic addiction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study for patients receiving ICI monotherapy for advanced NSCLC with at least one oncogenic driver alteration. Anonymized data were evaluated for clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes for ICI therapy: best response (RECIST 1.1), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was PFS under ICI. Secondary endpoints were best response (RECIST 1.1) and overall survival (OS) from ICI initiation. RESULTS: We studied 551 patients treated in 24 centers from 10 countries. The molecular alterations involved KRAS (n = 271), EGFR (n = 125), BRAF (n = 43), MET (n = 36), HER2 (n = 29), ALK (n = 23), RET (n = 16), ROS1 (n = 7), and multiple drivers (n = 1). Median age was 60 years, gender-ratio was 1:1, never/former/current smokers were 28/51/21% respectively, and the majority of tumors were adenocarcinoma. The objective response rate by driver alteration was: KRAS=26%, BRAF=24%, ROS1=17%, MET=16%, EGFR=12%, HER2=7%, RET=6%, ALK=0%. In the entire cohort, median PFS was 2.8 months, OS 13.3 months and the best response rate 19%. In a subgroup analysis, median PFS (in months) was 2.1 for EGFR, 3.2 for KRAS, 2.5 for ALK, 3.1 for BRAF, 2.5 for HER2, 2.1 for RET, and 3.4 for MET. In certain subgroups, PFS was positively associated with PD-L1 expression (KRAS, EGFR) and with smoking status (BRAF, HER2). CONCLUSIONS: ICI induced regression in some tumors with actionable driver alterations, but clinical activity was lower compared to the KRAS group and the lack of response in the ALK group was notable. Patients with actionable tumor alterations should receive targeted therapies and chemotherapy before considering immunotherapy.© The Author 2019.

However, the mechanisms involved in PD-L1 regulation are not fully understood. To provide better insight in these mechanisms, a multiangular analysis approach was used to combine protein and mRNA expression with several clinicopathological characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Archival tissues from 640 early stage, resected NSCLC patients were analyzed with immunohistochemistry for expression of PD-L1 and CD8 infiltration. In addition, mutational status and expression of a selection of immune genes involved in the PD-L1/PD-1 axis and T-cell response was determined. RESULTS: Tumors with high PD-L1 expression on TC or on IC represent two subsets of NSCLC with minimal overlap. We observed that PD-L1 expression on IC irrespective of expression on TC is a good marker for inflammation within tumors. In the tumors with the highest IC expression and absent TC expression an association with reduced IFNγ downstream signaling in tumor cells was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that PD-L1 expression on TC and IC are both independent hallmarks of the inflamed phenotype in NSCLC, and TC-negative/IC-high tumors can also be categorized as inflamed. The lack of correlation between PD-L1 TC and IC expression in this subgroup may be caused by impaired IFNγ signaling in tumor cells. These findings may bring a better understanding of the tumor-immune system interaction and the clinical relevance of PD-L1 expression on IC irrespective of PD-L1 expression on TC."

One of the latest developments is immunotherapy, which is increasingly becoming a mainstay for the treatment of these malignancies. Unlike conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy enhances anti-tumor immune response by blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints, and allowing our own immune system to fight against the tumor cells, arising as a new and innovative mechanism of action. Therefore, although well tolerated, these drugs have a unique side effect profile and are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Adverse effects of immunotherapy are most commonly observed in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung and endocrine systems. Less common toxicities may include neurological, haematological, cardiac, ocular or rheumatologic involvement. As far as we know, cancer patients are frequently seen in the Emergency Department due to treatment related toxicities, thus there is an increasing necessity to learn about this particular side effect profile given that they entail a different and unique management than that of classic chemotherapy drugs."

Several ICIs are already approved by the regulatory authorities, and many more are currently used in studies of several solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Positive studies have led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency approval of a number of these compounds, but none to date are approved in breast cancer (BC). Moreover, PD-1/PDL-1, MSI high (and dMMR), and tumor mutational burden are the currently "best" predictive markers for benefit from immunotherapy. BCs have some of these markers positive only in subsets but less frequently expressed than most other solid tumors, for example, malignant melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer. To improve the potential efficacy of ICI in BC, the addition of chemotherapy was one of the strategies. Many early and large clinical trials in all phases are underway in BC.

The main outcome measures included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs). Results: The results of meta-analysis are expressed as the hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

We sought to examine the relationship between these distinct variables with response to PD-1 blockade and long-term benefit.Experimental Design: We assessed the association between baseline tumor characteristics (TMB, PD-L1, CD4, and CD8) and clinical features and outcome in 38 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab (median follow-up of 4.5 years, range 3.8-5.5 years).Results: PD-L1 expression and CD8 infiltration correlated with each other and each significantly associated with objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). TMB was independent of PD-L1 and CD8 expression, and trended towards association with ORR and PFS. There was no association between CD4 infiltration and outcomes. Only PD-L1 expression was correlated with overall survival (OS). Among 5 patients with long-term survival >3 years with no additional systemic therapy, PD-L1 expression was the only discriminating feature. The increased predictive value for PFS and OS of composite biomarker inclusive of PD-L1, CD8, CD4, and TMB was limited.Conclusions: In patients with NSCLC treated with PD-1 blockade with long-term follow up, TMB, PD-L1, and CD8 were each associated with benefit from PD-1 blockade.

However, since the sex-dimorphism of the immune system is complex, involving multiple elements of immune-responses, it is possible that women could derive larger benefit than men from strategies other than therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) alone. Here we investigated whether women could derive larger benefit than men from the combination of chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. METHODS: We performed two meta-analyses. First, including all RCTs testing anti-PD1/ anti-PD-L1 plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, to assess different efficacy between men and women. Second, including all RCTs of first-line systemic treatment in advanced NSCLC testing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 given either alone or combined with chemotherapy to assess different efficacy of these two immunotherapeutic strategies according to patients sex. For each RCT included in the two meta-analyses, firstly, a trial-specific ratio of HRs was calculated from the ratio of the reported HRs in males and in females; secondly, these trial-specific ratios of HRs were combined across trials using a random-effects model to obtain a pooled HRs ratio. A pooled HRs ratio estimate lower than 1 indicates a greater treatment effect in men, and higher than 1 a greater effect in women. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included in the first meta-analysis. The pooled OS-HR comparing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy was 0.76 (95%CI, 0.66-0.87) for men and 0.48 (95%CI, 0.35-0.67) for women. The pooled-ratio of the OS-HRs reported in men versus women was 1.56 (95%CI, 1.21-2.01), indicating a statistically significant greater effect for women. Six RCTs were included in the second meta-analysis: 3 tested an anti-PD-1 alone, while three RCTs tested anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy. The pooled OS-HRs were 0.78 (95%CI, 0.60-1.00) in men and 0.97 (95%CI, 0.79-1.19) in women for anti-PD-1 alone, compared with 0.76 (95%CI, 0.64-0.91) in men and 0.44 (95%CI, 0.25-0.76) in women for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy. The pooled-ratio of OS-HRs, was 0.83 (95%CI, 0.65-1.06) for anti-PD-1 alone, indicating a greater effect in men, and 1.70 (95%CI, 1.16-2.49) for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy, indicating a greater effect in women.

Immunohistochemical stains with different antibodies for PD-L1 (DAKO, Spring Bioscience, Ventana, Cell Signaling, Biocare Medical, Abcam, Zeta Corporation) were performed, analyzed and compared. To summarize, we detected variable expression pattern of PD-L1 with general higher mean value of expression of tumor cells with clone SP263 in most tumor groups. In the comparison of selected cases of lung cancer, therapy relevant differences of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells with different antibodies were observed. Additionally, the profiling study of several PD-L1-antibody clones (28-8 Abcam and 28-8 DAKO, SP142, SP263) with Signal-to-Amino Acid Residue Plots was performed with interesting findings of cross-activity of SP142 with two peptides from PD-1, which can explain why clone SP142 stains immune cells more intensively, as previously published."

Whole tumor cell lysate (TCL) are ideal sources of antigens for cancer vaccine design, which however have limited efficacy due to insufficient immunogenicity. Recently, radiotherapy has been closely related to immunotherapy. Numerous studies have demonstrated the regulatory effect of irradiation (IR) on tumor immune response. Purpose: To explore the immunogenicity modulation effect of IR on lung cancer cells. Methods: RNA-sequence and qPCR assay was used to evaluate the change of tumor antigens expression after repeated X rays radiation on A549 cells. Vaccine based on TCL of irradiated Lewis lung cancer cells (IR-LLC) was established; therapeutic effect of TCL (IR-LLC) was examined in xenografted tumor model of mice. Flow cytometry was conducted to evaluate the rate of immune cells in spleen; ELISA was used to detect the level of cytokines in plasma. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the infiltrations of T-cell in tumor tissues; TIMER analysis was used to explore the correlations between tumor antigen expressions and the abundances of immune infiltrates. Results: IR upregulated the expression of tumor antigens in A549 cells. Compared to the control group and unirradiated tumor cell vaccine, TCL(IR-LLC) had a significantly stronger anti-tumor effect in mice bearing with LLC xenografts. TCL(IR-LLC) significantly increased matured DCs and total CD4+ T cells but downregulated Tregs and PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in mice spleen; TCL(IR-LLC) vaccine upregulated the level of IFN-γ and IL-4 while decreased IL-10 in serum; increased infiltrations of CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells were observed in the tumor issues of mice immunized with TCL(IR-LLC). Tumor antigens including FN1, MFGE8, MMP2, MYL9 may contribute to the enhanced T-cell response. Conclusion: This study confirmed the immunogenicity modulation effect of IR in NSCLC cells, indicating IR might be an effective strategy to enhance the anti-tumor immunity of cancer cell vaccine."

Pembrolizumab is one of the most advanced immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancer care. Apart from rare and serious adverse effects, its favorable tolerance profile enables to treat fragile patients who have often no other choice than best supportive care. The effective retained dose of pembrolizumab is a venous administration of 200 mg every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerance or up to 24 months. Pembrolizumab has already proven its efficacy and thus obtained marketing authorization in so-called hot or hypermutated tumors or tumors expressing PD-L1 such as melanomas, non-small cell lung cancers, urothelial carcinomas, cervical cancer, etc. Pembrolizumab is also authorized in the United States in the treatment of mismatch repair-deficient tumors or with microsatellite instability. The current challenge is to expand its use in tumor types that are supposed to be less immunogenic, for example, by attempting to warm up the tumor microenvironment, or by combining pembrolizumab with other molecules. An acceptable toxicity profile of such combinations remains to explore. We review here the current indications of this drug, the main prognostic and predictive factors of its efficacy as well as the potential forthcoming indications."

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that Gas6/PS-mediated activation of TAM receptors on tumor cells leads to subsequent upregulation of PD-L1, defining a putative PS→TAM receptor→PD-L1 inhibitory signaling axis in the cancer microenvironment that may promote tolerance. In this study, we tested combinations of TAM inhibitors and PD-1 mAbs in a syngeneic orthotopic E0771 murine triple-negative breast cancer model, whereby tumor-bearing mice were treated with pan-TAM kinase inhibitor (BMS-777607) or anti-PD-1 alone or in combination. Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk were differentially expressed on multiple cell subtypes in the tumor microenvironment. Although monotherapeutic administration of either pan-TAM kinase inhibitor (BMS-777607) or anti-PD-1 mAb therapy showed partial antitumor activity, combined treatment of BMS-777607 with anti-PD-1 significantly decreased tumor growth and incidence of lung metastasis. Moreover, combined treatment with BMS-777607 and anti-PD-1 showed increased infiltration of immune stimulatory T cells versus either monotherapy treatment alone. RNA NanoString profiling showed enhanced infiltration of antitumor effector T cells and a skewed immunogenic immune profile. Proinflammatory cytokines increased with combinational treatment. Together, these studies indicate that pan-TAM inhibitor BMS-777607 cooperates with anti-PD-1 in a syngeneic mouse model for triple-negative breast cancer and highlights the clinical potential for this combined therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that pan-inhibition of TAM receptors in combination with anti-PD-1 may have clinical value as cancer therapeutics to promote an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and improve host antitumor immunity.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research."

However, the majority of patients are resistant to PD-(L)1 blockade. Understanding mechanisms of primary resistance may allow prediction of clinical response and identification of new targetable pathways. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from 35 patients with NSCLC receiving nivolumab monotherapy. Cellular changes, cytokine levels, gene expression, and polymorphisms were compared between responders and nonresponders to treatment. Findings were confirmed in additional cohorts of patients with NSCLC receiving immune checkpoint blockade. RESULTS: We identified a genetic variant of a killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) KIR3DS1 that is associated with primary resistance to PD-1 blockade in patients with NSCLC. This association could be confirmed in independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC. In a multivariate analysis of the pooled cohort of 135 patients, the progression-free survival was significantly associated with presence of the KIR3DS1 allele (HR, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.68; P = 0.017). No relationship was seen in cohorts of patients with NSCLC who did not receive immunotherapy. Cellular assays from patients before and during PD-1 blockade showed that resistance may be due to NK-cell dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: We identified an association of the KIR3DS1 allelic variant with response to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC. This finding links NK cells with response to PD-1 therapy. Although the findings are interesting, a larger analysis in a randomized trial will be needed to confirm KIRs as predictive markers for response to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research."

The median survival of patients with brain metastases is 1 month without treatment. Novel immunotherapeutic strategies, such as those targeting the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) axis, are promising in patients with advanced systemic disease but are often preferentially administered to patients with tumors showing PD-L1 positivity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Surgically resected paired primary lung adenocarcinoma and brain metastasis samples of 61 patients were analyzed. We compared the paired samples regarding the amount of peritumoral and stromal mononuclear infiltration, PD-L1 expression of tumor and immune cells, and PD-1 expression of immune cells. We investigated the effect of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and steroid therapy on PD-L1 expression in brain metastases. RESULTS: There was significant positive correlation regarding the PD-L1 expression of tumor cells between the paired primary lung adenocarcinoma and brain metastatic samples with the use of different cutoff levels (1%, 5%, 50%). We found no impact of chemotherapy or steroid therapy on the changes of PD-L1 expression of tumor cells between the 2 sites. There is no or only limited concordance of the proportion of PD-1- or PD-L1-positive tumor-associated immune cells between the paired tumor samples, which suggests that brain metastases develop their own immune environment. CONCLUSION: We observed a strong correlation of PD-L1 positive tumor cells between primary lung adenocarcinoma cases and their corresponding brain metastases, which is not significantly influenced by chemotherapy or steroid therapy."

However, immune related adverse events (IRAEs) can occur during treatment. These side effects occur due to stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune system and can lead to serious complications. Recently, acral ischemia has been reported in some cases during treatment with programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors. Here, we discuss a case in which acral necrosis developed after initiation of a PD-1 inhibitor. We offer a review of the existing literature on the pathophysiology, clinical course and treatment outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old female was diagnosed with stage IV non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma and was started on pembrolizumab. The patient developed sudden onset numbness and discoloration of fingertips bilaterally at week 25 after initiation of ICI treatment. Extensive workup to rule out hypercoagulable, autoimmune and vascular disease was unremarkable except for mild elevation of ANA and ESR. The symptoms quickly progressed into dry gangrene within four weeks and did not respond to medical or surgical treatment. Pembrolizumab was subsequently discontinued due to progression of metastatic disease. The patient refused further interventions and transitioned to hospice care where she expired after two months. CONCLUSION: Acral ischemia can develop during treatment of malignancies. This complication, although uncommon, canresult in digital amputation. Physicians should be aware of the possible progression of acral vascular necrosis when Raynauds like symptoms develop. Larger studies are needed to confirm the role of ICIs in the pathogenesis of acral vascular necrosis."

Systemic anti-tumor reactions due to radiation therapy (RT) can lead to regression of non-irradiated lesions (NiLs), termed "abscopal effect" (AbE). Combination of both treatments can enhance this effect. The aim of this study was to evaluate AbEs during anti-PD-1 therapy and irradiation. We screened 168 patients receiving pembrolizumab or nivolumab at our center. Inclusion criteria were start of RT within 1 month after the first or last application of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and at least one metastasis outside the irradiation field. We estimated the total dose during ICI for each patient using the linear quadratic (LQ) model expressed as 2 Gy equivalent dose (EQD2) using α/β of 10 Gy. Radiological images were required showing progression or no change in NiLs before and regression after completion of RT(s). Images must have been acquired at least 4 weeks after the onset of ICI or RT. The surface areas of the longest diameters of the short- and long-axes of NiLs were measured. One hundred twenty-six out of 168 (75%) patients received ICI and RT. Fifty-three percent (67/126) were treated simultaneously, and 24 of these (36%) were eligible for lesion analysis. AbE was observed in 29% (7/24). One to six lesions (mean = 3 ± 2) in each AbE patient were analyzed. Patients were diagnosed with malignant melanoma (MM) (n = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n = 3), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n = 1). They were irradiated once (n = 1), twice (n = 2), or three times (n = 4) with an average total EQD2 of 120.0 ± 37.7 Gy. Eighty-two percent of RTs of AbE patients were applied with high single doses. MM patients received pembrolizumab, NSCLC, and RCC patients received nivolumab for an average duration of 45 ± 35 weeks. We demonstrate that 29% of the analyzed patients showed AbE. Strict inclusion criteria were applied to distinguish the effects of AbE from the systemic effect of ICI. Our data suggest the clinical existence of systemic effects of irradiation under ICI and could contribute to the development of a broader range of cancer treatments."

METHODS: Tumor tissue samples were prospectively collected from 183 patients with NSCLC including lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC). PD-L1 expression level was measured by immunohistochemistry assay and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status was assessed by next generation sequencing. Correlations between PD-L1 expressions, TMB status with clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was detected in 37% of ADC group and 55% in SQCC group while all clinicopathological characteristics were found comparable between these two groups. PD-L1 expression was negatively associated with overall survival in ADC group (P < 0.0001) but not in SQCC group (P = 0.418). In consistent with PD-L1 expression level, TMB status was significantly lower in ADC subjects as compared to SQCC subjects (P = 0.024) while PD-L1 positive subgroup and TMB high subgroup shared less subjects within ADC group than SQCC group. More importantly, the combination of TMB status and PD-L1 expression successfully identified responders, who showed significant longer median overall survival than non-responders (32 months vs. 8.5 months) in ADC subjects (P < 0.0001) but not in SQCC subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Here we tested the hypothesis that monitoring TMB, in addition to the existing PD-L1 expression level, could represent valuable non-invasive biomarkers for the chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Further analyses are in need to further assess the prognostic value of TMB for ADC and SQCC patients receiving immunotherapy."

Clinical features of a thyroid irAE including its predictability and relationship to prognosis remain to be elucidated. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive patients treated with nivolumab at Kyoto University Hospital between September 1, 2014 and August 31, 2017 were included in a retrospective cohort study. We systematically determined and classified subclinical and overt thyroid irAEs based on data collected of serum free T4 and TSH levels. Baseline characteristics and detailed clinical data were analyzed, and analyses of overall survival (OS) excluded patients censored within 1 month from the first administration of nivolumab. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients (33.5%) developed thyroid irAEs and these were divided into a subclinical thyroid irAE group (n = 40, 20.0%) and an overt thyroid irAE group (n = 27, 13.5%). Patients with thyroid uptake of FDG-PET before treatment showed high incidences of overt thyroid irAE (adjusted odds ratio 14.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.12-67.19), while the same relationship was not seen with subclinical thyroid irAE. Regarding the total cohort, the thyroid irAE (+) group had a significantly longer median OS than the thyroid irAE (-) group (16.1 versus 13.6 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.39-0.93). In 112 non-excluded patients with lung cancer, the thyroid irAE (+) group similarly had a longer median OS than the thyroid irAE (-) group (not reached versus 14.2 months, HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.27-0.92). However, this observation was not seen in 41 non-excluded patients with malignant melanoma (12.0 versus 18.3 months, HR 1.54; 95% CI 0.67-3.43). CONCLUSIONS: By thyroid uptake of FDG-PET, overt thyroid irAEs could be predicted before nivolumab therapy. Thyroid irAEs related to good prognosis in lung cancer but might be inconclusive in malignant melanoma."

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficacy of ICIs between younger and older patients. Materials and Methods: We searched online database and major conference proceedings for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published of ICIs and included RCTs that conducted subgroup comparisons of age with available combination of hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Subsequently, we figured out the pooled HR and 95%CI in younger and older patients with a random-effects model and evaluated the within-study heterogeneity by using subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analysis. Results and Conclusion: A total of 12 eligible RCTs included in our study, which reported OS according to patients age. The overall estimated random-effects for HR was 0.75 with 95% CI of 0.65-0.87 in younger arm versus 0.81 with 95% CI of 0.72-0.92 in older arm. ICIs can improve OS for patients with advanced or metastatic lung cancer when compared to controls, especially for those patients with NSCLC, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, non-squamous, Pembrolizumab or Atezolizumab used as well as subsequent-line setting, and the magnitude of benefit in OS had comparable efficacy in both younger and older arms using a cut-off of 65 yr. Conversely, we also drew a statically significant conclusion that older patients failed to acquire benefit from ICIs when subdivided with a further cut-off of 75 yr."

Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: The study included 208 cases who were diagnosed with NSCLC and who underwent surgical resection between 2001 and 2012. Programmed death-ligand-1 (SP142 clone) was applied to the histological sections acquired from the microarray paraffin blocks with immunohistochemistry. Staining intensity was scored as weak (+, 1), moderate (++, 2), and strong (+++, 3). Percentage (0%-100%) was multiplied by staining intensity (1-2-3) to calculate the H score. Four different cut-off values were used; 1: ≥1% (independent of intensity), 2: ≥5% (independent of intensity), 3: ≥5% moderate/strong staining (except for weak staining), 4: H score ≥30 values were considered positive. In this study, staining a single cell at any intensity was considered positive. Results: Thirty-four out 208 cases (16.3%) had PDL-1 positive staining. PDL-1 expression was observed in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma independent of the histological type or subtype (range; 0-25%). When the cut-off level was set to ≥5% with moderate and strong staining, the median overall survival was 45 months for the PD-L1 positive group and not reached for the PD-L1 negative group (p-value 0.024). PD-L1 positivity was significantly higher in patients over the age of 60 years and in cases with a tumor diameter of more than 5 cm (p=0.023 and 0.025, respectively).

In humans, the correlation between immune-related gene expression and CD274 (encoding PD-L1) or PDCD1LG2 (encoding PD-L2) was investigated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. In addition, PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression in tumor cells and CD8+ T-cell infiltration were assessed by IHC.Results: In animal models, we showed that PD-L2 expression alone or simultaneously expressed with PD-L1 in tumor cells significantly suppressed antitumor immune responses, such as tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and was involved in the resistance to treatment with anti-PD-L1 mAb alone. This resistance was overcome by anti-PD-1 mAb or combined treatment with anti-PD-L2 mAb.

Human immune system-engrafted models are used in immuno-oncology (IO) studies for subcutaneous cancer cell or patient-derived xenograft implantations that mimic primary tumor growth. Novel efficacy models for IO compounds on bone metastases need to be established. The study was performed using CIEA NOG (NOG) mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (huNOG) and age-matched immunodeficient NOG mice. Bone phenotyping was performed to evaluate baseline differences. BT-474 human breast cancer cells were inoculated into the tibia bone marrow, and cancer-induced bone changes were monitored by X-ray imaging. Bone content and volume were analyzed by dual X-ray absorptiometry and microcomputed tomography. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of immune checkpoint markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Bone phenotyping showed no differences in bone architecture or volume of the healthy bones in huNOG and NOG mice, but the bone marrow fat was absent in huNOG mice. Fibrotic areas were observed in the bone marrow of some huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors induced osteoblastic bone growth. Bone lesions appeared earlier and were larger, and bone mineral density was higher in huNOG mice. huNOG mice had a high number of human CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells in immune-related organs. A low number of TILs and PD-1-positive cells and low PD-L1 expression were observed in the BT-474 tumors at the endpoint. This study reports characterization of the first breast cancer bone growth model in huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors represent a "cold" tumor with a low number of TILs.

However, the predictive value of manual PD-L1 scoring is imperfect and alternative measures are needed. We report an automated image analysis solution to determine the predictive and prognostic values of the product of PD-L1+ cell and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) densities (CD8xPD-L1 signature) in baseline tumor biopsies. METHODS: Archival or fresh tumor biopsies were analyzed for PD-L1 and CD8 expression by immunohistochemistry. Samples were collected from 163 patients in Study 1108/NCT01693562, a Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate durvalumab across multiple tumor types, including NSCLC, and a separate cohort of 199 non-ICT- patients. Digital images were automatically scored for PD-L1+ and CD8+ cell densities using customized algorithms applied with Developer XD™ 2.7 software. RESULTS: For patients who received durvalumab, median overall survival (OS) was 21.0 months for CD8xPD-L1 signature-positive patients and 7.8 months for signature-negative patients (p = 0.00002). The CD8xPD-L1 signature provided greater stratification of OS than high densities of CD8+ cells, high densities of PD-L1+ cells, or manually assessed tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥25%. The CD8xPD-L1 signature did not stratify OS in non-ICT patients, although a high density of CD8+ cells was associated with higher median OS (high: 67 months; low: 39.5 months, p = 0.0009) in this group. CONCLUSIONS: An automated CD8xPD-L1 signature may help to identify NSCLC patients with improved response to durvalumab therapy. Our data also support the prognostic value of CD8+ TILS in NSCLC patients who do not receive ICT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01693562 . Study code: CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108.

TMB is typically calculated from whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing (WES) data. Recently, clinical trials showed that TMB can also be estimated from targeted sequencing of a panel of only a few hundred genes of interest, which can be performed at a high depth for clinical applications.  Materials and methods: In this study, we systematically investigated the distribution of TMB and preferences at the gene and mutation level, as well as the correlation between TMB calculated by WES and panel sequencing data using somatic mutation data from 15 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  Results: We proposed a pan-cancer TMB panel and demonstrated that it had a higher correlation with WES than other panels. Our panel could serve as a reference data-set for TMB-oriented panel design to identify patients for immunotherapy."

To improve these results, combined approaches are being tested. The addition of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) to ICI seems promising. A systematic review was performed in order to assess the safety and efficacy of SABR-ICI combination. Material and Methods: MEDLINE databases from 2009 to March 3, 2019 were reviewed to obtain English language studies reporting clinical outcomes of the combination of ICI-SABR in NSCLC. 18 out of the 429 initial results fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were selected for review. Results: Eighteen articles, including six prospective studies, describing 1736 patients treated with an ICI-SABR combination fulfilled the selection criteria. The reported mean rates for local control and distant/abscopal response rates were 71% and 41%, respectively. Eleven studies reported progression-free survival and overall survival, with a mean of 4.6 and 12.4 months, respectively. Toxicity rates were consistent with the ones attributable to ICI treatment alone. Conclusions: The ICI-SABR combination has a good safety profile and achieves high rates of local control and greater chances of obtaining abscopal responses than SABR alone, with a relevant impact on PFS. More studies are needed to improve patient selection for an optimal benefit from this approach."

Immunochemistry (IHC) for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein is the only available biomarker to inform clinical decision-making regarding treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC. Because each PD-1/PD-L1 blockade was approved together with a specific PD-L1 IHC assay used in the clinical trials, pathologists have been challenged with performing various assays with a limited sample. To provide a more unified understanding of this, several cross-validation studies between platforms have been performed and showed consistent results. However, the interchangeability of assays may be limited in practice because of the risk of misclassification of patients for the treatment. Furthermore, several issues, including the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in the tumor, and the potential for cytology specimens to be used as an alternative to tissue samples for PD-L1 testing, have still not been resolved. In the future, one of the main aims of immunotherapy research should be to find a novel predictive biomarker for PD-1 blockade therapy and a way to combine it with PD-L1 IHC and other tests."

Here we report a combined tumour-therapeutic modality based on integrating nanosonosensitizers-augmented noninvasive sonodynamic therapy (SDT) with checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy. All components of the nanosonosensitizers (HMME/R837@Lip) are clinically approved, wherein liposomes act as carriers to co-encapsulate sonosensitizers (hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME)) and immune adjuvant (imiquimod (R837)). Using multiple tumour models, we demonstrate that combining nanosonosensitizers-augmented SDT with anti-PD-L1 induces an anti-tumour response, which not only arrests primary tumour progression, but also prevents lung metastasis. Furthermore, the combined treatment strategy offers a long-term immunological memory function, which can protect against tumour rechallenge after elimination of the initial tumours. Therefore, this work represents a proof-of-concept combinatorial tumour therapeutics based on noninvasive tumours-therapeutic modality with immunotherapy."

METHODS: This retrospective study included 137 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab monotherapy (75 women; median age: 65 years), who had a baseline CT and at least one follow-up abdomen CT during therapy. Baseline and all follow-up abdominal CTs performed for monitoring of nivolumab therapy were reviewed to identify the organ-specific abdominal irAEs including colitis/enteritis, hepatitis, biliary toxicity, pancreatitis, nephritis, sarcoid-like reaction, and pancreatic and adrenal atrophy. Their frequency and imaging features were described. RESULTS: Eighteen (13%) patients had radiologically identified abdominal irAEs (median 2.1 months after starting nivolumab; interquartile range 1.17-5.83 months); 16 patients developed enteritis/colitis (12 pancolitis, two segmental colitis, one enterocolitis, one enteritis), two hepatitis, one adrenalitis. One patient with hepatitis also developed colitis/enteritis. Radiographic abdominal irAE occurred after nivolumab therapy was discontinued in six patients before any subsequent therapy was started. IrAEs prompted nivolumab interruption and treatment with steroids in four patients (three colitis/enteritis, one hepatitis). Most common CT features of colitis/enteritis included mesenteric hyperemia (n = 15), bowel wall thickening (n = 13), mucosal hyperenhancement (n = 10), and fluid-filled colon (n = 9). CONCLUSION: Abdominal irAEs were detected on CT in 13% of NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab, and colitis, in the pancolitis form, was the most common irAE. Given the expanding role of immunotherapy, radiologists should be aware of the frequency and imaging manifestations of abdominal irAEs and the impact on patient management."

Now that PD-(L)1 inhibitors are routinely used as adjuvant and first-line treatments, sequential PD-(L)1 inhibition followed by osimertinib use may become more frequent and have unforeseen serious toxicity. METHODS: We identified patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were treated with PD-(L)1 blockade and EGFR- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), irrespective of drug or sequence of administration (total n = 126). Patient records were reviewed to identify severe (NCI-CTCAE v5.0 grades 3-4) toxicity. RESULTS: Fifteen percent [6 of 41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7% to 29%] of all patients treated with sequential PD-(L)1 blockade followed later by osimertinib developed a severe irAE. Severe irAEs were most common among those who began osimertinib within 3 months of prior PD-(L)1 blockade (5 of 21, 24%, 95% CI 10% to 45%), as compared with >3-12 months (1 of 8, 13%, 95% CI 0% to 50%), >12 months (0 of 12, 0%, 95% CI 0% to 28%). By contrast, no severe irAEs were identified among patients treated with osimertinib followed by PD-(L)1 (0 of 29, 95% CI 0% to 14%) or PD-(L)1 followed by other EGFR-TKIs (afatinib or erlotinib, 0 of 27, 95% CI 0% to 15%). IrAEs occurred at a median onset of 20 days after osimertinib (range 14-167 days). All patients with irAEs required steroids and most required hospitalization. CONCLUSION: PD-(L)1 blockade followed by osimertinib is associated with severe irAE and is most frequent among patients who recently received PD-(L)1 blockade. No irAEs were observed when osimertinib preceded PD-(L)1 blockade or when PD-(L)1 was followed by other EGFR-TKIs. This association appears to be specific to osimertinib, as no severe irAEs occurred with administration of other EGFR-TKIs.© The Author(s) 2019.

We investigated the association between the PD-L1 expression and formalin fixation time, and clarified the optimal duration of fixation for accurate PD-L1 evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 55 tumor specimens from resected NSCLC patients. The samples were halved and immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 12-24 h (normal fixation), or 96-120 h (prolonged fixation). Each specimen was stained using two assay systems (22C3 and SP263) for PD-L1. RESULTS: The mean PD-L1 tumor proportion score was not significantly different between normal and prolonged fixation groups for either 22C3 or SP263 (normal fixation: 18.8%; prolonged fixation: 16.3%, p=0.277; normal fixation: 16.2%; prolonged fixation: 17.6%, p=0.560, respectively). CONCLUSION: Formalin fixation duration for up to 120 h does not affect PD-L1 IHC expression. PD-L1 tumor proportion score of tumor specimens can be evaluated by IHC even if these have been fixed in formalin outside the recommended duration in clinical practice."

METHODS: T-cell infiltration was quantified on BM biopsies from 13 patients with AML, and flow cytometry was performed on BM aspirates (BMAs) from 107 patients with AML who received treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The authors evaluated the expression of inhibitory receptors (programmed cell death protein 1 [PD1], cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA4], lymphocyte-activation gene 3 [LAG3], T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 [TIM3]) and stimulatory receptors (glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor-related protein [GITR], OX40, 41BB [a type 2 transmembrane glycoprotein receptor], inducible T-cell costimulatory [ICOS]) on T-cell subsets and the expression of their ligands (41BBL, B7-1, B7-2, ICOSL, PD-L1, PD-L2, and OX40L) on AML blasts. Expression of these markers was correlated with patient age, karyotype, baseline next-generation sequencing for 28 myeloid-associated genes (including P53), and DNA methylation proteins (DNA methyltransferase 3α, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1[IDH1], IDH2, Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 [TET2], and Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 [FLT3]). RESULTS: On histochemistry evaluation, the T-cell population in BM appeared to be preserved in patients who had AML compared with healthy donors. The proportion of T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in BMAs was higher in patients with AML than in healthy donors. PD1-positive/OX40-positive T cells were more frequent in AML BMAs, and a higher frequency of PD1-positive/cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-positive T cells coexpressed TIM3 or LAG3. PD1-positive/CD8-positive T cells were more frequent in BMAs from patients who had multiply relapsed AML than in BMAs from those who had first relapsed or newly diagnosed AML. Blasts in BMAs from patients who had TP53-mutated AML were more frequently positive for PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: The preserved T-cell population, the increased frequency of regulatory T cells, and the expression of targetable immune receptors in AML BMAs suggest a role for T-cell-harnessing therapies in AML.© 2018 The Authors.

The expression of PD-L1 is controlled by c-Myc; however, further upstream regulation of PD-L1 expression is largely unknown. We have previously shown that atypical protein kinase C lambda/iota (aPKCλ) phosphorylates the Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) transcription factor at Ser218 to suppress its DNA-binding ability, thereby regulating c-Myc expression and controlling physiologic and pathologic endothelial proliferation. The presence of phosphorylation of FoxO1 at Ser218 (pSer218 FoxO1) in cutaneous angiosarcoma (CAS) strongly correlates with poor patient prognosis. Here, we reported that patients with PD-L1+ cells in CAS lesions showed significantly worse prognosis compared to those that were PD-L1- . Expression of PD-L1 correlated with that of aPKCλ or the presence of pSer218FoxO1. Moreover, suppression of aPKCλ expression or inhibition of its activity in HUVECs or AS-M, an established human angiosarcoma cell line, resulted in decreased PD-L1 expression. Our results suggest that combined treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors and aPKCλ inhibitors could be a novel treatment strategy for CAS patients.© 2019 The Authors.

For the remaining patients, an immunotherapy-based regimen alone or in combination with chemotherapy is now the preferred option based on high-level evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials and in accordance with all available guidelines. Deciding between therapeutic options can be difficult due to the lack of direct cross-comparison studies, differences in chemotherapies and stratification factors, and differences in study populations resulting from inclusion criteria such as histology, PD-L1 expression, or tumor mutational burden (TMB).

Pembrolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, has also shown survival benefit in lung SCC. Concurrent inhibition of the PD-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways represents a rational approach to improve responses and delay the onset of treatment resistance in lung SCC. TRIAL DESIGN: This phase II, open-label, single-arm study (NCT03157089) is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with stage IIIB/IV lung SCC that has progressed during/after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Eligible patients must have ≥1 target lesion (as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) and must have not received previous immune checkpoint inhibitor/EGFR-targeted therapy. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile will be determined during a safety run-in with oral afatinib (starting dose, 40 mg/d) with intravenous pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks). In the main study, all patients will receive afatinib at the RP2D with pembrolizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 35 cycles. The primary end point is objective response (complete + partial response). Other end points include disease control, duration of objective response, progression-free survival, overall survival, tumor shrinkage, RP2D, and pharmacokinetics.

Binding to PD-1 prevents its interaction with natural ligands and allows for the reactivation of the immune response against cancer cells. The list of approved indications of pembrolizumab is fast expanding, including its use as first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is a complex and evolving disease. Pharmacogenomics significantly contributed to understanding this complexity, allowing for the identification of molecular biomarkers and novel pharmacologic targets. This approach has delivered more effective and less toxic drugs for advanced NSCLC. In our opinion, pharmacogenomics played a key role in the approval of pembrolizumab as frontline therapy for NSCLC with high expression of the PD-1 ligand, which occurs in ∼30% of patients. Moreover, an analysis conducted on the ongoing clinical trials sponsored by the drugs patent holder shows that the characterization and validation of additional pharmacogenomic biomarkers of response has the potential to extend the frontline clinical use of pembrolizumab in NSCLC."

Recently, fixed-dose regimens were commercialised with reference weights higher than the accurate weight of patients with cancer in routine practice. This may have important economic consequences for healthcare systems. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Budget impact analysis was performed using real-world data both from Gustave Roussy database and the French National Hospital Discharge database and including patients treated with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab at Gustave Roussy and in France before the approval of fixed-dosing regimens in Europe. Main outcome is the expected annual budget impact of fixed-dosing regimens in France. RESULTS: From January to April 2018, 978 perfusions of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 were administered at our institution including 560 perfusions of nivolumab in 103 patients and 418 perfusions of pembrolizumab in 125 patients mainly treated for lung cancer and melanoma. The mean extra cost attributable to flat doses would have amounted to €284 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 241-327) per infusion of nivolumab and to €1287 (95% CI: 1200-1373) per infusion of pembrolizumab. Annually, at Gustave Roussy, it would represent an extra cost of € 477 120 (95% CI: 404 880-549 360) and €1 613 898 (95% CI: 1 504 800-1 721 742), respectively, for the year 2018. At the French national level, the expected annual budget impact is estimated at €55 162 211 for the year 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Weight references for fixed-dose regimens do not reflect the accurate mean weight of patients under cancer treatment and are likely to have substantial economic impact for healthcare systems."

SCLC is associated with smoking and exhibits a high mutational burden. However, low expression of PD-L1 and MHC antigens, as well low levels of immune cell infiltration and rapid tumor progress seems to limit the efficacy of anticancer immunity. Nevertheless, long-term survival was reported from studies using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 agents. AREAS COVERED: Data of clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC show lower success rates compared to NSCLC. The mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy are discussed for their relevance to SCLC patients. EXPERT OPINION: Although some factors, such as a high mutation rate, favor immunotherapy for SCLC patients, downregulation of MHC class I, low expression of PD-L1, poor tumor infiltration by effector T cells, presence of myeloid-derived suppressor cells as well as regulatory T lymphocytes counteract the immune system activation by checkpoint inhibitors. Furthermore, this tumor develops avascular regions which have immunosuppressive effects and restrict access of lymphocytes and antibodies. In conclusion, immunotherapy in SCLC is effective in highly selected patients with good performance status and special and unknown preconditions contributing to long-lasting responses."

A thorough analysis of the technical and functional differences among all therapies is provided, along with a critical discussion of prospective treatments and potential biomarkers. EXPERT OPINION: The use of immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer has provided clear benefits for patients. Still, exploitation of the full potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination, or adoptive cell therapies is hampered by, amongst other reasons, the lack of reliable biomarkers and possible adverse immune effects.

Expert commentary: Clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in AML and MDS are still in early stages and reported results so far have been modest especially for monotherapy use in the refractory settings. However, there are preliminary data for synergistic effects for combination of multiple ICI with hypomethylating agents and conventional chemotherapy. ICI might also be effective in eradicating minimal residual disease and to prevent relapse following induction chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Additional trials to provide insight into the efficacy and safety profile of immune checkpoint-based therapy, its optimal timing and potential combination with other types of therapy as well as identification of predictive biomarkers are needed."

Methods: The relevant studies were retrieved and systematic evaluation was conducted. Databases were searched until November 2018. Results: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 6932 patients were included. Patients with the higher PD-L1 expression level tend to have a longer progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR). PFS and OS were significantly prolonged in all the subgroups of PD-L1 expression levels. For patients with PD-L1 expression levels of ≥1%, overall response rates were significantly prolonged, but there was no difference in patients with PD-L1 expression levels of <1% (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.87-3.52; p = 0.12). EGFR wild-type NSCLC patients could benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in PFS (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45-0.91; p = 0.01) and OS (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.62-0.73; p < 0.00001). Conclusion: This study indicates that PD-L1-positive or EGFR wild-type advanced NSCLC patients might get potential benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors."

Though a majority of patients tolerate treatment, some develop hematologic toxicities, including eosinophilia. Eosinophilia has been associated with better responses in some patients with melanoma, but this has not been investigated in non-small-cell lung cancer. We present a case of a woman with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma who developed asymptomatic hypereosinophilia after initiation of nivolumab. Her eosinophil count temporarily decreased after transiently stopping the medication, but increased again after re-initiation. She had a favorable tumor response to therapy. This exemplifies the potential role of eosinophilia as a peripheral, readily available biomarker of favorable response to immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer. Awareness of this manifestation is important."

METHODS: Patients were required to have available data for EGFR mutation, PD-L1 expression, and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. RESULTS: Among 178 patients with EGFR-mutant (n = 38) or wild-type (WT) (n = 140) tumors, the EGFR mutation group had a lower objective response rate (ORR) (15.8% vs. 32.9%, p = 0.04) than the EGFR WT group, similar to the pattern observed for other factors: weak/negative PD-L1 expression vs. strong PD-L1 expression (17.3% vs. 39.2%, p = 0.001); never smokers vs. smokers (19.4% vs. 35.1%, p = 0.03); and females vs. males (21.0% vs. 33.6%, p = 0.08). EGFR mutation and weak/negative PD-L1 expression were associated with a significantly shorter median PFS than EGFR WT (1.9 vs. 3.0 months, p = 0.04) and strong PD-L1 expression (1.6 vs. 3.9 months, p = 0.007), respectively. In multivariate analysis, EGFR mutation predicted worse ORR [hazard ratio (HR) 3.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-8.63] and PFS (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.11-2.75), as did weak/negative PD-L1 expression (ORR, HR 3.46, 95% CI 1.62-7.37; and PFS, HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.17-2.53). CONCLUSIONS: Together with PD-L1 expression, EGFR mutation status is an important factor to predict the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma."

OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs and PD-1 inhibitor with differed doses were applied to treat PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) assay with carboxyfluorescein diacetate/succinimidyl ester staining target cells before treatment and propidium iodide (PI) staining dead cells after treatment were conducted to detect the cytotoxic activity. DRLC mice were constructed by injection of PC9 LCSCs suspension and Matrigel into left lung of SD mice. DRLC mice were randomly divided into five groups: control group, cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 CTLs group, OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group, PD-1 inhibitor group, and OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group. In vitro, both CCK8 assay and FCM assay disclosed that OCT4&SOX2-specific CTLs plus PD-1 inhibitor presented with elevated cytotoxic activity on PC9 cells and PC9 LCSCs. In vivo, tumor volume and tumor weight were decreased, while tumor necrosis and tumor apoptosis were increased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group than CMV pp65 CTLs group and control group, and in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group. In addition, CD8 expression was increased while OCT4&SOX2 expressions were decreased in OCT4&SOX2 CTLs + PD-1 inhibitor group than OCT4&SOX2 CTLs group and PD-1 inhibitor group.

The effects of these immune checkpoint inhibitors in the older patient population has not been adequately assessed. OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of aging on CTLA-4 and PDL-1 inhibitors efficacy and immune-related adverse events (irAE) in the context of real-world management of advanced solid cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective study involved all non-study patients with histologically-confirmed metastatic or inoperable solid cancers receiving immunotherapy at Kingston Health Sciences Centre. We defined older patient as age ≥ 75. All statistical analyses were conducted under SPSS IBM for Windows version 24.0. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Study outcomes included immunotherapy treatment response, survival, as well as number, type, and severity of irAEs. RESULTS: Our study (N = 78) had 29 (37%) patients age <65, 26 (33%) patients age 65-74, and 23 (30%) patients age ≥75. Melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma accounted for 70%, 22%, and 8% of the study population, respectively. Distributions of ipilimumab (32%), nivolumab (33%), and pembrolizumab (35%) were similar in the study. The response rates were 28%, 27%, and 39% in the age <65, age 64-74, age ≥75 groups, respectively (P = 0.585). Kaplan-Meier curve showed a median survival of 28 months (12.28-43.9, 95% CI) and 17 months (0-36.9, 95% CI) in the age <65 and age 64-74 groups, respectively; the estimated survival probability did not reach 50% in the age ≥75 group (P = 0.319). There were no statistically significant differences found in terms of irAEs, multiple irAEs, severity of grade 3 or higher, types of irAEs, and irAEs resolution status when comparing between different age groups. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that patients age ≥75 are able to gain as much benefit from immunotherapy as younger patients, without excess toxicity. Our findings suggest that single agent immunotherapy is generally well-tolerated across different age groups with no significant difference in the type, frequency or severity of irAEs. Future studies evaluating aging and combination immunotherapy are warranted.","Crown"

Responsiveness to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is thought to rely on neoantigen exposure and immune elements in the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we explored the features of the tumor immune microenvironment in elderly patients with treatment-naïve LUAD. METHODS: Transcriptome profiles and clinical characteristics of patients with LUAD were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas as a discovery cohort. Immune cell infiltration (quantified by a single-sample gene set enrichment analysis), immunoregulatory molecule expression, and mutational patterns (from The Cancer Immunome Atlas) were compared between young and elderly patients. Immune cell infiltration was verified by immunohistochemistry using a validation cohort including 105 treatment-naïve patients with LUAD. A tissue microarray consisting of 120 LUAD patients was used in the immunohistochemistry validation. RESULTS: Activated CD8+ T cell numbers increased slightly with age, but cytolytic molecules in T cells (granzyme B [GZMB], perforin 1 [PRF1], granzyme A [GZMA], granzyme M [GZMM], and granulysin [GNLY]) gradually declined. PD-L1 expression was not associated with age; however, a number of immunosuppressive elements beyond PD-L1 were upregulated in aging patients, including regulatory T cells and co-inhibitory molecules, for example, TIM-3, TIGIT, and HHLA2. Finally, senescence was accompanied by a loss of clonal neoantigens, which is believed to be correlated with responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients were characterized by increased numbers of CD8+ T cells and impaired cytolytic molecule expression. The observed immune signature was also associated with a loss of clonal neoantigens and the accumulation of immunosuppressive elements. These findings show a unique immune microenvironment in senescence and support biomarker-guided candidate identification for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapeutic strategies for elderly patients with LUAD."

While the inflammatory cytokine can stimulate the immune system and promote tumor growth, it remains unclear how circulating IL-6 can potentiate a poor prognosis. We hypothesized that a mechanism for IL-6-associated poor prognosis is that these patients would have altered T-cell populations and impaired T-cell signaling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma levels of IL-6 were measured using a Cytometric Bead Array. T-cell populations from Non-small cell lung cancer patients were characterized using surface markers by flow cytometry, and signaling in the T-cell populations were measured by PhosFlow cytometry. RESULTS: We determine that patients with high circulating IL-6 levels had distinct T cell characteristics relative to those with low levels. Patients with high levels of IL-6 had significantly more Treg cells and elevated Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) expression on CD4+, CD8+, Treg, and Th17 cells. These patients also showed impaired signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) signaling upon stimulation with IL-6 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and T-Cells from a healthy donor that were treated for four days with IL-6 displayed a similar muting of STAT signaling, which verified the effect seen in patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: This work directly links circulating IL-6 with other poor prognostic indicators, STAT1 and PD-1, and highlights the effects of circulating IL-6 on the immune system. Our data suggest that alteration in T cell populations and function may be a mechanism underlying the poor prognosis seen in NSCLC patients with high IL-6 levels."

Regorafenib was the first agent to show a survival benefit over placebo in patients who showed progression while being treated with sorafenib, but it remains an unsatisfactory agent owing to its serious side effects. Therefore, more efficient and milder therapies are needed. PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we report a patient with advanced HCC with many lung metastases who showed progression during sorafenib treatment. DIAGNOSES: HCC with lung metastases (stage IVB). INTERVENTIONS: SHR-1210 alone was used as second-line treatment. OUTCOMES: Although the lung metastases did not decrease 3 months after the treatment, they decreased significantly at 6 months after the treatment and partially disappeared. The tumor response indicated partial response. Furthermore, all of the lung metastases continued to decrease at about 17 months after treatment. The alpha-fetoprotein levels showed a similar trend. After a follow up of 19 months, the patient remains in good health. LESSONS: SHR-1210 alone as a second-line treatment for a patient with HCC showed excellent antitumor effects. We think that SHR-1210 may exert its antitumor effects through a late-onset model, which persist for a long time. The side effects were mild and well tolerated."

However, this comes at the cost of frequent, serious immune-related adverse events, necessitating a reduction in the recommended dose of ipilimumab that is given to patients4. In mice, co-treatment with surrogate anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies is effective in transplantable cancer models, but also exacerbates autoimmune colitis. Here we show that treating mice with clinically available TNF inhibitors concomitantly with combined CTLA-4 and PD-1 immunotherapy ameliorates colitis and, in addition, improves anti-tumour efficacy. Notably, TNF is upregulated in the intestine of patients suffering from colitis after dual ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment. We created a model in which Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice were adoptively transferred with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, causing graft-versus-host disease that was further exacerbated by ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment. When human colon cancer cells were xenografted into these mice, prophylactic blockade of human TNF improved colitis and hepatitis in xenografted mice, and moreover, immunotherapeutic control of xenografted tumours was retained. Our results provide clinically feasible strategies to dissociate efficacy and toxicity in the use of combined immune checkpoint blockade for cancer immunotherapy."

Here we analyzed real-world outcomes of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in the first year following U.S. regulatory approval. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data collected during routine patient care in community cancer care clinics. The cohort included patients with mNSCLC who had received nivolumab or pembrolizumab for metastatic disease (n = 1,344) with >1 EHR-documented visit from January 1, 2011, to March 31, 2016. Patients with a > 90-day gap between advanced disease diagnosis and first EHR structured data entry were excluded. RESULTS: Estimated median overall survival (OS) was 8.0 months (95% confidence interval 7.4-9.0 months). Estimated median OS was 4.7 months (3.4-6.6) for patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement- and epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive tumors, and 8.6 months (7.7-10.6) for patients without such mutations. Age at PD-1 inhibitor initiation or line of therapy did not impact OS. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests OS in real-world patients may be shorter than in conventional clinical trial patient cohorts, potentially due to narrow trial eligibility criteria. The lack of difference in OS by line of therapy or age at immunotherapy initiation suggests sustained benefit of PD-1 inhibitors in multitreated patients with mNSCLC and that age is not a predictor of outcome. Further studies are underway in patients with comorbidities, organ dysfunction, and multiple prior therapies. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study evaluated data derived from electronic health records of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in the year following regulatory approval. This real-world cohort had shorter overall survival (OS) indexed to PD-1 inhibitor initiation than reported in clinical trials. Late-line treatment did not influence OS, and patients aged >75 at immunotherapy initiation did not have worse outcomes than younger patients. As new therapies enter clinical practice, real-world data can complement clinical trial evidence providing information on generalizability and helping inform clinical treatment decisions.© AlphaMed Press 2018."

Materials and methods: A total of 36 NSCLC patients for whom both the surgically resected specimens of the primary tumors and re-biopsy specimens of the recurrent tumors were available were enrolled in this study. The PD-L1 expression status and tumor-infiltrating CD8-positive T lymphocytes (CD8+TILs) count were measured in paired samples by immunohistochemistry. The concordance rate in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) classification based on the PD-L1 expression status and CD8+TILs count was analyzed. Results: While the PD-L1 expression levels were similar between the surgical and re-biopsy specimens in 77.8% of cases, in 16.7% of cases, the expression levels were higher in the re-biopsy specimens. When the analysis was confined to patients who had received platinum-based chemotherapy, the percentage increased to 42.9%. The TIME classification changed in the re-biopsy specimens as compared to the surgical specimens in one-third of the patients, especially in those who had received chemotherapy previously. The TIME classification in the re-biopsy specimens more closely resembled that in the metastatic lymph nodes as compared to that in the primary tumor. Conclusion: In patients with recurrent NSCLC, especially those who have received chemotherapy previously, a recent re-biopsy sample is required to determine whether PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors should be used for treatment or not."

[Epub ahead of print]","Sex Differences in Tolerability to Anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Are We All Equal?","BACKGROUND: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have emerged as a serious clinical issue in the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Risk factors for irAEs remain controversial. Therefore, we studied sex differences in irAEs in patients treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anti-PD-1 therapy at Mayo Clinic Rochester and Florida from 2015 to 2018 were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test was used for time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: In 245 patients with metastatic melanoma, premenopausal women were more likely to experience irAEs (all grades) compared with postmenopausal women and men (67% vs. 60% vs. 46%), primarily because of an increase in endocrinopathies (33% vs. 12% vs. 10%, respectively). In patients with NSCLC (231 patients), women (all ages) were also more likely to develop irAEs of all grades (48% vs. 31%). Women with NSCLC were more likely to develop pneumonitis (11% vs. 4%) and endocrinopathies (14% vs. 5%). No differences in grade ≥3 toxicities were seen across sexes in both cohorts, but women were more likely to receive systemic steroids for the treatment of irAEs compared with men. Better progression-free-survival was observed in women with NSCLC and irAEs (10 months vs. 3.3 months) compared with women without irAEs. CONCLUSION: Women with metastatic melanoma and NSCLC are more likely to experience irAEs compared with men. We also observed differences between sexes in the frequency of certain irAEs. Larger studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of this study suggest that women may be at a higher risk for immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared with men when treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 therapy. In addition, women were more likely to develop certain irAEs, including endocrinopathies and pneumonitis. Close follow-up of women undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors will allow clinicians to diagnose these treatment-related complications early, potentially reducing their associated morbidity and mortality. In addition, a possible association between irAEs and response to therapy was observed.© AlphaMed Press 2019."

There has been increasing concern over the benefit of anti-PD-1 antibody in high-risk patients, such as those with preexisting interstitial lung disease (ILD). However, the status and value of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker and the efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody in NSCLC patients with preexisting ILD remains uncertain. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of advanced/recurrent NSCLC patients who had undergone analysis of the tumor PD-L1 expression. We identified 358 patients with advanced/recurrent NSCLC who had undergone analysis of tumor PD-LI expression. Of these, 210 received anti-PD-1 antibody. Tumor-cell PD-L1 expression was similar between the groups with and without preexisting ILD (median, 35%; interquartile range, 0-70%; vs. median, 10%; interquartile range, 1-68%; p = 0.66). Of the 210 patients who received anti-PD-1 antibody, 14 patients had preexisting ILD. The progression-free survival (PFS) showed no significant difference between the patients receiving anti-PD-1 antibody with and without preexisting ILD (median PFS, 4.3 vs. 5.3 months; HR, 0.97; p = 0.84). Within the patients with preexisting ILD, the PFS was tended to be longer in the patients with tumor PD-L1 expression ≥ 50% than in those with tumor PD-L1 expression < 50% (median PFS, 12.5 vs. 2.5 months; HR, 0.47; p = 0.14). The value of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker may be comparable between patients with and without preexisting ILD."

In our recent case of a 52-year-old female doctor suffering from breast cancer having metastasized to the lung and liver, it was decided to use nivolumab to prevent the disease progressing after excisional surgeries and multiple chemotherapies. One month after completing the nivolumab course, fatigue, hypoglycemia and hypotension developed and isolated ACTH deficiency (IAD) was diagnosed. A further month later, under steroid supplementation, hyperglycemia emerged alongside thirst and polydipsia, prompting a diagnosis of fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1D). Her susceptibility to type 1 diabetes was examined by HLA haplotype and CTLA4 gene polymorphism analyses. Polymorphisms CT60G>A and +49G>A in CTLA4 both generated a GG genotype. Our patient manifested one of the rarest combinations of autoimmune disease induced by nivolumab. Whereas the HLA haplotype was unsusceptible to autoimmune type 1 diabetes, polymorphisms of CTLA4, the antibody of which frequently causes hypophysitis, were susceptible to FT1D. Peripheral modulation of activated T cells, mainly by PD-1 antibodies, induced FT1D associated with IAD in patients with CTLA4 polymorphism. This case reveals hints of the T-cell etiology in T1D and evidence of CTLA4 involvement in IAD."

However, autoimmune toxic effects are frequent and poorly understood, making it important to understand the pathophysiologic processes of autoimmune adverse effects induced by checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Objective: To gain mechanistic insight into autoimmune skin toxic effects induced by anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was conducted from July 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Patients (n = 73) with non-small cell lung cancer who received anti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) were recruited from 4 different centers in Switzerland (Kantonsspital St Gallen, Spital Grabs, Spital Wil, and Spital Flawil). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tumor biopsy specimens and biopsies from sites of autoimmune skin toxic effects were collected over a 2-year period, with patient follow-up after 1 year. Main Outcomes and Measures: Response to treatment, overall survival, progression-free survival, and development of autoimmune toxic effects (based on standard laboratory values and clinical examinations). Results: Of the cohort of 73 patients with NSCLC (mean [SD] age, 68.1 [8.9] years; 44 [60%] men), 25 (34.2% [95% CI, 24.4%-45.7%]) developed autoimmune skin toxic effects. Of the 73 patients with NSCLC, 25 (34.2% [95% CI, 24.4%-45.7%]) developed autoimmune skin toxic effects, which were more frequent in patients with complete remission or partial remission (68.2% [95% CI, 47.3%-83.6%]) than those with progressive or stable disease (19.6% [95% CI, 11.0%-32.5%]) (χ2 = 14.02, P < .001). Nine T-cell antigens shared between tumor tissue and skin were identified. These antigens were able to stimulate CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in vitro. Several of the antigen-specific T cells found in blood samples were also present in autoimmune skin lesions and lung tumors of patients who responded to anti-PD-1 therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings highlight a potential mechanism of checkpoint inhibitor-mediated autoimmune toxic effects and describe the association between toxic effects and response to therapy; such an understanding will help in controlling adverse effects, deciphering new cancer antigens, and further improving immunotherapy."

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a negative regulator of the immune response that may contribute to impaired viral clearance. Whether PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab could reinvigorate anti-JC virus immune activity in patients with PML was unknown. METHODS: We administered pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg per kilogram of body weight every 4 to 6 weeks to eight adults with PML, each with a different underlying predisposing condition. Each patient received at least one dose but no more than three doses. RESULTS: Pembrolizumab induced down-regulation of PD-1 expression on lymphocytes in peripheral blood and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in all eight patients. Five patients had clinical improvement or stabilization of PML accompanied by a reduction in the JC viral load in the CSF and an increase in in vitro CD4+ and CD8+ anti-JC virus activity. In the other three patients, no meaningful change was observed in the viral load or in the magnitude of antiviral cellular immune response, and there was no clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in some patients with PML, pembrolizumab reduces JC viral load and increases CD4+ and CD8+ activity against the JC virus; clinical improvement or stabilization occurred in five of the eight patients who received pembrolizumab. Further study of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of PML is warranted. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)."

Antibodies targeting Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1)/Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) demonstrated a relevant clinical value in a large number of solid tumors, leading to an improvement of progression free survival and overall survival in comparison to standard chemotherapy. However, across different solid malignancies, the immune-checkpoints inhibitors efficacy is limited to a relative small number of patients and, for this reason, the identification of positive or negative predictive biomarkers represents an urgent need. Despite the expression of PD-L1 was largely investigated in various malignancies, (i.e., melanoma, head and neck malignancies, urothelial and renal carcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer) as a biomarker for ICB treatment-patients selection, it showed an important, but still imperfect, role as positive predictor of response only in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Importantly, other tumor and/or microenvironments related characteristics are currently under clinical evaluation, in combination or in substitution of PD-L1 expression. In particular, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, gene expression analysis, mismatch- repair deficiency, and tumor mutational landscape may play a central role in predicting clinical benefits of CTLA-4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. In this review, we will focus on the clinical evaluation of emerging biomarkers and how these may improve the naïve vision of a single- feature patients-based selection."

Six antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint proteins programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4) have been approved. In some cases, response rates have been impressive, but not uniformly so and not consistently; similarly, toxicity to this class of therapeutic is often unpredictable and can be life threatening. Predicting treatment response and toxicity are two main obstacles to truly individualize treatment with ICIs. One of the most severe and life-threatening adverse events is colitis induced colonic perforation, estimated to occur in 1.0 to 1.5% of patients treated with ICIs. An important question to address is, under what circumstances is it appropriate to reinitiate ICI treatment post-bowel perforation? CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 62-year-old woman, who presented with stage IV lung cancer. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that 80% of the patients tumor cells expressed PD-L1. The patient was started on a three-week cycle of pembrolizumab. Subsequent reducing in tumor burden was observed within ten weeks. Initially, pembrolizumab was tolerated fairly well, with the exception of immunotherapy related hypothyroidism. However, the patient experienced a second, more serious immune-related adverse event (irAE), in the form of enteritis, which led to small bowel perforation and necessitated exploratory laparotomy. The concerning part of the small bowel was resected, and a primary anastomosis was created. Based on the pathological and surgical findings, the patient was diagnosed with pembrolizumab-associated small bowel perforation. The patient recovered well from surgery and, considering the patients remarkable response to treatment, a collective decision was made to reinitiate pembrolizumab on post-operative day twenty-eight. The patient is continuing her immunotherapy with ongoing partial response and is able to continue her full-time job. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights the challenges of identifying patients likely to respond to ICIs and those that are likely to experience irAEs and it discusses the impressive work that has been done to start to address these challenges. Lastly, the topic of reinitiating pembrolizumab treatment even after colonic perforation is discussed."

We report a patient with brain metastatic lung adenocarcinoma in whom fatal myocarditis developed after sequential use of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. This finding was validated in syngeneic tumor-bearing mice. The mice bearing lung metastases of CT26 colon cancer cells treated with PD-1 and/or PD-L1 inhibitors showed that the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1, either sequentially or simultaneously administered, caused myocarditis lesions with myocyte injury and patchy mononuclear infiltrates in the myocardium. A significant increase of infiltrating neutrophils in myocytes was noted only in mice with sequential blockade, implying a role for the pathogenesis of myocarditis. Among circulating leukocytes, concurrent and subsequent treatment of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors led to sustained suppression of neutrophils. Among tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, combinatorial blockade increased CD8+ T cells and NKG2D+ T cells, and reduced tumor-associated macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells in the lung metastatic microenvironment. The combinatorial treatments exhibited better control and anti-PD-L1 followed by anti-PD-1 was the most effective. In conclusion, the combinatory use of PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade, either sequentially or concurrently, may cause fulminant cardiotoxicity, although it gives better tumor control, and such usage should be cautionary."

Significant morbidity and mortality can result, and severe pneumonitis attributed to ICB precludes continued therapy. Thus, discriminating between radiation- and ICB- related pneumonitis is of importance for the increasing number of patients receiving both treatments. Furthermore, data are limited regarding the interplay between radiation- and ICB-induced lung injury, and which biomarkers might be associated with toxicity. CASE PRESENTATION: We report longitudinal clinical and radiologic data, and circulating biomarkers in a melanoma patient treated with axillary radiation followed by ICB who developed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGO) within the radiation field suggestive of radiation-pneumonitis followed by consolidation outside of the radiation field suggestive of ICB-related pneumonitis. Of note, symptomatic radiation-pneumonitis developed despite a low radiation dose to the lung (V20 < 8%), and ICB-related pneumonitis was limited to the ipsilateral lung, suggesting additive effect of radiation and ICB in the development of lung injury. Circulating biomarker analyses demonstrated increases in CXCR2, IL1ra and IL2ra that coincided with the development of symptomatic pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the imaging findings associated with radiation and ICB-related lung toxicity, and anecdotally describe a clinical course with circulating biomarker correlates. This information can help guide clinical evaluation and future research investigations into the toxicity of combined radiation immunotherapy approaches."

However, considering pre-existing genetic and gut microbiota variation, the relevance remains unknown in the East-Asian NSCLC population. This study is designed to explore the relationship between gut microbiome and clinical outcomes in Chinese patients with NSCLC who have received treatment using an anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC receiving treatment with nivolumab were enrolled in CheckMate 078 (NCT02613507) and CheckMate 870 (NCT03195491). Fecal samples were collected at the starting point, when patients received nivolumab, at clinical evaluation, and when disease progression was noted. 16S ribosome RNA gene sequencing was applied to assess gut microbiota profiles. Peripheral immune signatures were determined by multicolor flow cytometry in parallel. RESULTS: When subgrouping patients into responder (R) and nonresponder according to the clinical response assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 1.1, R patients harbored higher diversity of gut microbiome at the starting point with stable composition during the treatment. Patients with high microbiome diversity had significantly prolonged progression-free survival when compared to those with low diversity. Compositional difference was observed between the two groups as well with the enrichment of Alistipes putredinis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Prevotella copri in R whereas Ruminococcus_unclassified enriched in nonresponding patients. Analysis of systemic immune responses using multicolor flow cytometry revealed that patients with a high abundance of microbiome diversity in the gut had a greater frequency of unique memory CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell subsets in the periphery in response to anti-PD-1 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal strong correlation between gut microbiome diversity and the responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients with favorable gut microbiome (such as those with high diversity) exhibit enhanced memory T cell and natural killer cell signatures in the periphery. These findings provide important implications for the prediction and the evaluation of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy against NSCLC in the Chinese population."

However, the expression pattern of these receptors on T cell subpopulations of a different activation status and at different sites is poorly characterized. Thus, we analyzed the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on the naïve, activated, memory, and activated memory T cells. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the lung affected by lung cancer (clBALF), the opposite healthy lung (hlBALF), and peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected from 32 patients. The cells were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry. The proportion of memory, activated, and activated memory CD8+ cells with the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 were elevated in the clBALF when compared to the hlBALF (insignificantly), but these proportions were significantly higher in the BALF when compared with the PB. The proportions of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ T cells were elevated in the squamous cell carcinoma when compared to the adenocarcinoma patients. Also, the expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on T cells from the BALF was significantly higher than from PB. We report for the first time the differential expression of checkpoint molecules on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes at a different stage of activation in the local environment of lung cancer. Moreover, the circulating T cells have a distinct expression of these receptors, which suggests their poor utility as biomarkers for immunotherapy."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We determined PD-L1 expression of tumor cells (TC) and immune cells (IC), and PD-1 expression of IC by immunohistochemistry in 268 lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) patients, and correlated the data with smoking, COPD, tumor grade, necrosis, lepidic growth pattern, vascular invasion, density of stromal IC, and EGFR/KRAS status of the tumors. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between PD-L1 expression of TC and IC, as well as PD-L1 and PD-1 expression of IC. Tumor necrosis was associated with higher PD-L1 expression of TC and PD-1 expression of IC. A negative correlation was observed between lepidic growth pattern and PD-L1 expression of TC and PD-L1/PD-1 expression of IC. EGFR mutation seemed to negatively correlate with PD-1 expression of IC, but this tendency could not be verified when applying corrections for multiple comparisons. No significant effect of the KRAS mutation on any of the studied variables could be established. CONCLUSION: Here we first demonstrate that the presence of necrosis correlates with higher PD-L1 expression of TC and PD-1 expression of IC in LADC. Further studies are required to determine the predictive value of this observation in LADC patients receiving immunotherapy."

However, proper predictive factors allowing precise qualification of NSCLC patients for immunotherapy have not been developed so far. Expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells and tumor mutation burden are used in qualification of patients to first line therapy with pembrolizumab and atezolizumab in combination with ipilimumab in prospective clinical trials. Nevertheless, not all patients with these predictive factors benefit from immunotherapy. Major methodological difficulties in testing of these factors and in the interpretation of test results still exist. Therefore, other predictive factors are sought. Intensive research on the recognition of tumor immunophenotype and gut microbiome in NSCLC patients are underway. The first correlations between the effectiveness of immunotherapy and the intensity of inflammatory response in the tumor, microbiome diversity, and the occurrence of certain bacterial species in gut have been described. The purpose of our manuscript is to draw attention to factors affecting the efficacy of immunotherapy with anti-PD-L1 antibodies in NSCLC patients. Additional markers, for example TMB (tumor mutations burden) or microbiome profile, are needed to more accurately determine which patients will benefit from immunotherapy treatment."

RESULTS: In the whole cohort (N = 163), IHC results suggested a higher detection rate of PD-L1 in the metastasis than that of the primary site (χ2 = 4.66, p = 0.03), with a low consistent rate of 32.5%. Among different metastatic tumors, PD-1 was highly expressed in the lung/lymph node (65.3%) and poorly expressed in the brain (10.5%) and visceral metastases (12.5%). PD-L1 was highly expressed in lung/lymph node (37.5%) and the bone metastases (12.2%) on the contrary. In terms of survival analysis, patients with PD-1 expression either in the primary or metastasis had a shorter overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.08-2.36, p = 0.02). Also, PD-L1 expression in the primary was associated with a shorter OS (HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.06-6.15, p = 0.04). In the multivariate analysis, the predictive accuracy of the whole model for PFS was increased from 0.683 to 0.699 after adding PD-1. CONCLUSION: PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 were differentially expressed between primary and metastatic tumors. Histopathological examination of these immune check points in metastatic lesions of mRCC should be noticed, and its accurate diagnosis may be one of the effective ways to realize the individualized treatment."

Here, we show that pulsatile, rather than continuous, treatment with MEK inhibitors (MEKis) maintains T cell activation and enables their proliferation. Two MEKis, selumetinib and trametinib, induce T cell activation with increased CTLA-4 expression and, to a lesser extent, PD-1 expression on T cells in vivo after cyclical pulsatile MEKi treatment. In addition, the pulsatile dosing schedule alone shows superior anti-tumor effects and delays the emergence of drug resistance. Furthermore, pulsatile MEKi treatment combined with CTLA-4 blockade prolongs survival in mice bearing tumors with mutant Kras. Our results set the foundation and show the importance of a combinatorial therapeutic strategy using pulsatile targeted therapy together with immunotherapy to optimally enhance tumor delay and promote long-term anti-tumor immunity."

To evaluate the relative benefit in term of Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) of checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone, overall and in subgroups defined by PDL1 expression we have performed a meta-analysis. Data Sources: This meta-analysis searched PubMed and checked references of the selected English language articles to identify further eligible trials. Data collection for this study took place from October 1 to October 24, 2018. Results: In total, 8 trials involving 4,646 patients with advanced NSCLC, 3.314 (71%) and 1.332 (29%) with a non-squamous and squamous histology, respectively, were included in this meta-analysis. Four trials used atezolizumab, 3 pembrolizumab, and 1 nivolumab, accounting for 2.985 (64%), 1.298 (28%), and 363 (8%) of patients, respectively. The patients were randomized to receive first-line chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor vs. first-line chemotherapy, 2,978 patients for the OS endpoint and first-line chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor vs. first-line chemotherapy, 1,740 patients in the PFS endpoint. Checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy were associated with prolonged OS, compared with chemotherapy in the ITT population (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.87; p = 0.0002, with significant heterogeneity among trials). Notably within the PDL1 low group (1-49) there was a significant heterogeneity (p = 0.06) between type of drug and efficacy: the combination of chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab showed an OS benefit (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.78; P < 0.00007) unlike the atezolizumab backbone trials (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62-1.37; P < 0.69). However, checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy were associated with prolonged PFS in the ITT (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.56-0.66; P < 0.00001) and across PDL1 subgroups. Conclusion and Relevance: Checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy, are associated with significantly prolonged OS and PFS in first-line therapy in NSCLC. In the low PDL1 subgroups the benefit was statistically significant only in the pembrolizumab backbone trials. The findings of this meta-analysis could assist in the design and interpretation of future trials and in economic analyses."

LKB1 has an essential role in the control of cellular redox homeostasis by regulating ROS production and detoxification. Loss of LKB1 makes the tumor cell more sensitive to oxidative stress and consequently to stress-inducing treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. LKB1 loss triggers complex changes in tumor microenvironment, supporting a role in the regulation of angiogenesis and suggesting a potential role in the response to anti-angiogenic treatment. On the other hand, LKB1 deficiency can promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment and may be involved in primary resistance to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1, as it has been reported in lung cancer. The aim of this review is to discuss interactions of LKB1 with the tumor microenvironment and the potential applications of this knowledge in predicting response to treatment in lung cancer."

Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated survival benefits of alternative treatments to docetaxel. However, information is lacking on which patients benefit the most and what drug or regimen is optimal. We report a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of second-line treatments in all subgroup combinations determined by histology, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Biosciences Information Service (using the Dialog Platform), Cochrane Library, and abstracts from scientific meetings were searched for RCTs published up to September 2015. Key outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Bayesian hierarchical exchangeable NMAs were conducted to calculate mean survival times and relative differences for eight subgroups, using docetaxel as the reference comparator. For OS, the NMA was based on hazard ratios applied to a first-order fractional polynomial model fitted to the reference treatment. For PFS, a second-order fractional polynomial model was fitted to reconstructed patient-level data for the entire network of evidence. RESULTS: The search identified 30 studies containing 17 different treatment regimens. Docetaxel plus ramucirumab was associated with a significant improvement in OS and PFS, relative to docetaxel, regardless of patient type. Docetaxel plus nintedanib showed similar efficacy to docetaxel plus ramucirumab in the nonsquamous populations. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib showed superior levels of efficacy in EGFR mutation-positive populations and the one PD-1 immunotherapy (nivolumab) studied showed superior efficacy in the populations exhibiting high PD-L1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of head-to-head comparisons, we performed a mixed-treatment analysis to synthesize evidence of the efficacy of each treatment. Benefits are optimized by targeting specific treatments to individual patients guided by histology, PD-L1 expression, and EGFR mutation status."

ICIs are antibodies that block negative regulators of the T cell immune response, including cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1). While ICIs have introduced a significant mortality benefit in several cancer types, the augmented immune response has led to a range of immune-related toxicities, including cardiovascular toxicity. ICI-associated myocarditis often presents with arrhythmias, may co-exist with myositis and myasthenia gravis, can be severe, and portends a poor prognosis. In addition, pericardial disease, vasculitis, including temporal arteritis, and non-inflammatory heart failure, have been recently described as immune-related toxicities from ICI.

When combined with cisplatin (which alone does not induce ICD), crizotinib sensitizes NSCLC models to subsequent immunotherapy with PD-1 blockade, allowing to cure more than 90% of established orthotopic cancers. Of note, simultaneous treatment of mice with cisplatin, crizotinib and PD-1 blocking antibodies causes acute hepatotoxicity that can be avoided by a sequential regimen involving initial treatment with cisplatin plus crizotinib, followed by PD-1 blockade one week later.

However, emerging evidence show that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can lead to hyperprogressive disease (HPD), a flair-up of tumor growth linked to dismal prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of HPD and identify the determinants associated with HPD in patients with NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with recurrent and/or metastatic NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors between April 2014 and November 2018. Clinicopathologic variables, dynamics of tumor growth, and treatment outcomes were analyzed in patients with NSCLC who received PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. HPD was defined according to tumor growth kinetics (TGK), tumor growth rate (TGR), and time to treatment failure (TTF). Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood CD8+ T lymphocytes was conducted to explore the potential predictive biomarkers of HPD. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients were analyzed. HPD was observed in 55 (20.9%), 54 (20.5%), and 98 (37.3%) patients according to the TGK, TGR, and TTF. HPD meeting both TGK and TGR criteria was associated with worse progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 4.619; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.868-7.440) and overall survival (HR, 5.079; 95% CI, 3.136-8.226) than progressive disease without HPD. There was no clear relationship between clinicopathologic variables and HPD. In the exploratory biomarker analysis with peripheral blood CD8+ T lymphocytes, a lower frequency of effector/memory subsets (CCR7-CD45RA- T cells among the total CD8+ T cells) and a higher frequency of severely exhausted populations (TIGIT+ T cells among PD-1+CD8+ T cells) were associated with HPD and inferior survival rate. CONCLUSION: HPD is common in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Biomarkers derived from rationally designed analysis may successfully predict HPD and worse outcomes, meriting further investigation of HPD.© The Author 2019.

We previously demonstrated that Plasmodium infection promotes innate and adaptive immunity against cancer in a murine Lewis lung cancer model but its effects on immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment are unknown. METHODS: Whole Tumors and tumor-derived sorted cells from tumor-bearing mice treated with or without plasmodium infected red blood cells were harvested 17 days post tumor implantation and analyzed using QPCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and functional assays. Differences between groups were analyzed for statistical significance using Students t-test. RESULTS: Here we found that Plasmodium infection significantly reduced the proportions of MDSCs and Tregs in the lung tumor tissues of the treated mice by downregulating their recruiting molecules and blocking cellular activation pathways. Importantly, CD8+ T cells isolated from the tumors of Plasmodium-treated mice exhibited significantly higher levels of granzyme B and perforin and remarkably lower levels of PD-1. CONCLUSION: We reveal for the first time, the effects of Plasmodium infection on the expansion and activation of MDSCs and Tregs with a consequent elevation of CD8+T cell-mediated cytotoxicity within the tumor microenvironment and hold great promise for the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies."

Neutralizing antibodies targeting immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) have been particularly successful for tumor types with limited therapeutic options such as melanoma and lung cancer. However, reactivation of T cells is only one step toward tumor elimination, and a substantial fraction of patients fails to respond to these therapies. In this context, combination therapies targeting more than one of the steps of the cancer-immune cycle may provide significant benefits. To find the best combinations, it is of upmost importance to understand the interplay between cancer cells and all the components of the immune response. This review focuses on the elements of the complement system that come into play in the cancer-immunity cycle. The complement system, an essential part of innate immunity, has emerged as a major regulator of cancer immunity. Complement effectors such as C1q, anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and their receptors C3aR and C5aR1, have been associated with tolerogenic cell death and inhibition of antitumor T-cell responses through the recruitment and/or activation of immunosuppressive cell subpopulations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Tregs), or M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Evidence is provided to support the idea that complement blocks many of the effector routes associated with the cancer-immunity cycle, providing the rationale for new therapeutic combinations aimed to enhance the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors."

Previous studies have identified several predictive biomarkers, including the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapies in NSCLC patients; however, the usefulness of these biomarkers in NSCLCs with EGFR mutations has not been elucidated. The present study was conducted to evaluate the predictive biomarkers for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. We retrospectively analyzed 9 patients treated with nivolumab for EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. All but one patient received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors before nivolumab treatment. The overall response rate and median progression-free survival were 11% and 33 days (95% confidence interval (CI); 7 to 51), respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that patients with a good performance status (P = 0.11; hazard ratio (HR) 0.183, 95% CI 0.0217 to 1.549), a high density of CD4+ T cells (P = 0.136; HR 0.313, 95% CI 0.045 to 1.417) and a high density of Foxp3+ cells (P = 0.09; HR 0.264, 95% CI 0.0372 to 1.222) in the tumor microenvironment tended to have longer progression-free survival with nivolumab. Multivariate analysis revealed that a high density of CD4+ T cells (P = 0.005; HR<0.001, 95% CI <0.001 to 0.28) and a high density of Foxp3+ cells (P = 0.003; HR<0.001, 95% CI NA) in tumor tissues were strongly correlated with better progression-free survival. In contrast to previous studies in wild type EGFR NSCLCs, PD-L1 expression was not associated with the clinical benefit of anti-PD-1 treatment in EGFR-mutated NSCLCs. The current study indicated that immune status in the tumor microenvironment may be important for the effectiveness of nivolumab in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations."

Still, many patients do not respond to these inhibitors. PD-L1 (CD274) expression, one of the factors that influences the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, is dynamic. Here, we studied the regulation of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC without targetable genetic alterations in EGFR, ALK, BRAF, ROS1, MET, ERBB2 and RET. Analysis of RNA sequencing data from these NSCLCs revealed that inferred IFNγ, EGFR and MAPK signaling correlated with CD274 gene expression in lung adenocarcinoma. In a representative lung adenocarcinoma cell line panel, stimulation with EGF or IFNγ increased CD274 mRNA and PD-L1 protein and membrane levels, which were further enhanced by combining EGF and IFNγ. Similarly, tumor cell PD-L1 membrane levels increased after coculture with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, using EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and erlotinib or the MEK 1 and 2 inhibitor selumetinib, prevented EGF- and IFNγ-induced CD274 mRNA and PD-L1 protein and membrane upregulation, but had no effect on IFNγ-induced MHC-I upregulation. Interestingly, although IFNγ increases transcriptional activity of CD274, MAPK signaling also increased stabilization of CD274 mRNA. In conclusion, MAPK pathway activity plays a key role in EGF- and IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma without targetable genetic alterations and may present a target to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. © 2019 The Authors.

Objective: To assess whether a database that combines EHR-derived clinical data with CGP can identify and extend associations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Design, Setting, and Participants: Clinical data from EHRs were linked with CGP results for 28 998 patients from 275 US oncology practices. Among 4064 patients with NSCLC, exploratory associations between tumor genomics and patient characteristics with clinical outcomes were conducted, with data obtained between January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2018. Exposures: Tumor CGP, including presence of a driver alteration (a pathogenic or likely pathogenic alteration in a gene shown to drive tumor growth); tumor mutation burden (TMB), defined as the number of mutations per megabase; and clinical characteristics gathered from EHRs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival (OS), time receiving therapy, maximal therapy response (as documented by the treating physician in the EHR), and clinical benefit rate (fraction of patients with stable disease, partial response, or complete response) to therapy. Results: Among 4064 patients with NSCLC (median age, 66.0 years; 51.9% female), 3183 (78.3%) had a history of smoking, 3153 (77.6%) had nonsquamous cancer, and 871 (21.4%) had an alteration in EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 (701 [17.2%] with EGFR, 128 [3.1%] with ALK, and 42 [1.0%] with ROS1 alterations). There were 1946 deaths in 7 years. For patients with a driver alteration, improved OS was observed among those treated with (n = 575) vs not treated with (n = 560) targeted therapies (median, 18.6 months [95% CI, 15.2-21.7] vs 11.4 months [95% CI, 9.7-12.5] from advanced diagnosis; P < .001). TMB (in mutations/Mb) was significantly higher among smokers vs nonsmokers (8.7 [IQR, 4.4-14.8] vs 2.6 [IQR, 1.7-5.2]; P < .001) and significantly lower among patients with vs without an alteration in EGFR (3.5 [IQR, 1.76-6.1] vs 7.8 [IQR, 3.5-13.9]; P < .001), ALK (2.1 [IQR, 0.9-4.0] vs 7.0 [IQR, 3.5-13.0]; P < .001), RET (4.6 [IQR, 1.7-8.7] vs 7.0 [IQR, 2.6-13.0]; P = .004), or ROS1 (4.0 [IQR, 1.2-9.6] vs 7.0 [IQR, 2.6-13.0]; P = .03). In patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies (n = 1290, 31.7%), TMB of 20 or more was significantly associated with improved OS from therapy initiation (16.8 months [95% CI, 11.6-24.9] vs 8.5 months [95% CI, 7.6-9.7]; P < .001), longer time receiving therapy (7.8 months [95% CI, 5.5-11.1] vs 3.3 months [95% CI, 2.8-3.7]; P < .001), and increased clinical benefit rate (80.7% vs 56.7%; P < .001) vs TMB less than 20. Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with NSCLC included in a longitudinal database of clinical data linked to CGP results from routine care, exploratory analyses replicated previously described associations between clinical and genomic characteristics, between driver mutations and response to targeted therapy, and between TMB and response to immunotherapy. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of creating a clinicogenomic database derived from routine clinical experience and provide support for further research and discovery evaluating this approach in oncology."

After receiving mixed bacterial vaccine (MBV) consisting of 6 kinds of heat-inactivated bacteria plus Poly I:C, the patients condition rapidly improved, systemic metastases gradually reduced in size or disappeared, anemia was corrected, and the patient was able to resume normal life and work. MBV treatment in the setting of failure of previous immunotherapy treatment appears to have achieved objective response for this patient with metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma, which has lasted more than 20 months."

Several studies have reported that secondary sarcopenia is an indicator of postoperative recurrence. We hypothesized that there is a correlation between the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and sarcopenia. We retrospectively analyzed 38 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with ICIs between February 2016 and April 2018. Patients were divided into two groups according to the change rate of the psoas major muscle area (PMMA) at the L2-L3 position and investigated the correlation between the change rate of the PMMA and the efficacy of ICIs was investigated. The objective response and disease control rates were lower in patients with sarcopenia than in those without sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia exhibited a significantly shorter median progression-free survival (PFS) than non-sarcopenia patients. Moreover, focusing on good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status patients, sarcopenia patients showed a shorter PFS than non-sarcopenia patients. Patients with sarcopenia are associated with poor outcomes for immunotherapy among those with advanced NSCLC, based on retrospective analysis. Further research is needed to validate the clinical biomarkers involved in ICI responders."

However, the majority of patients show little to no response or acquire resistance during treatment with checkpoint inhibitors delivered as a monotherapy. Therefore, identifying resistance mechanisms and novel combination therapy approaches is imperative to improve responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. To address this, we performed an in vivo shRNA dropout screen that focused on genes encoding for FDA-approved drug targets (FDAome). We implanted epithelial and mesenchymal Kras/p53 (KP) mutant murine lung cancer cells expressing the FDAome shRNA library into syngeneic mice treated with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Sequencing for the barcoded shRNAs revealed Ntrk1 was significantly depleted from mesenchymal tumors challenged with PD-1 blockade, suggesting it provides a survival advantage to tumor cells when under immune system pressure. Our data confirmed Ntrk1 transcript levels are upregulated in tumors treated with PD-1 inhibitors. Additionally, analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cell populations revealed that Ntrk1 can promote CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Lastly, we found that Ntrk1 regulates Jak/Stat signaling to promote expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells. Together, these data suggest that Ntrk1 activates Jak/Stat signaling to regulate expression of immunosuppressive molecules including PD-L1, promoting exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment."

However, the reliability of this marker is still under debate. Moreover, PD-L1 is widely expressed by many immune cell types, and little is known on the relevance of systemic PD-L1⁺ cells for responses to immune checkpoint blockade. We present two clinical cases of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and PD-L1-negative tumors treated with atezolizumab that showed either objective responses or progression. These patients showed major differences in the distribution of PD-L1 expression within systemic immune cells. Based on these results, an exploratory study was carried out with 32 cases of NSCLC patients undergoing PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapies, to compare PD-L1 expression profiles and their relationships with clinical outcomes. Significant differences in the percentage of PD-L1⁺ CD11b⁺ myeloid cell populations were found between objective responders and non-responders. Patients with percentages of PD-L1⁺ CD11b⁺ cells above 30% before the start of immunotherapy showed response rates of 50%, and 70% when combined with memory CD4 T cell profiling. These findings indicate that quantification of systemic PD-L1⁺ myeloid cell subsets could provide a simple biomarker for patient stratification, even if biopsies are scored as PD-L1 null."

In this study, we explored the roles of dendritic cell (DC)-expressed Notch ligands in the regulation of T-cell effector function. METHODS: We generated mice with CD11c lineage-specific deletion of Notch Delta-like ligand (Dll)1 and Jagged (Jag)2. Using these genetically-ablated mice and engineered pharmacological Notch ligand constructs, the roles of various Delta-like and Jagged ligands in the regulation of T-cell-mediated immunity were investigated. We assessed tumor growth, mouse survival, cytokine production, immunophenotyping of myeloid and lymphoid populations infiltrating the tumors, expression of checkpoint molecules and T-cell function in the experimental settings of murine lung and pancreatic tumors and cardiac allograft rejection. Correlative studies were also performed for the expression of NOTCH ligands, NOTCH receptors and PD-1 on various subsets of myeloid and lymphoid cells in tumor-infiltrating immune cells analyzed from primary human lung cancers. RESULTS: Mice with CD11c lineage-specific deletion of Notch ligand gene Dll1, but not Jag2, exhibited accelerated growth of lung and pancreatic tumors concomitant with decreased antigen-specific CD8+T-cell functions and effector-memory (Tem) differentiation. Increased IL-4 but decreased IFN-γ production and elevated populations of T-regulatory and myeloid-derived suppressor cells were observed in Dll1-ablated mice. Multivalent clustered DLL1-triggered Notch signaling overcame DC Dll1 deficiency and improved anti-tumor T-cell responses, whereas the pharmacological interference by monomeric soluble DLL1 construct suppressed the rejection of mouse tumors and cardiac allograft. Moreover, monomeric soluble JAG1 treatment reduced T-regulatory cells and improved anti-tumor immune responses by decreasing the expression of PD-1 on CD8+Tem cells. A significant correlation was observed between DC-expressed Jagged and Delta-like ligands with Tem-expressed PD-1 and Notch receptors, respectively, in human lung tumor-infiltrates. CONCLUSION: Our data show the importance of specific expression of Notch ligands on DCs in the regulation of T-cell effector function. Thus, strategies incorporating selectively engineered Notch ligands could provide a novel approach of therapeutics for modulating immunity in various immunosuppressive conditions including cancer."

The combination of cisplatin and high-dose crizotinib induces ICD in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells and effectively controls the growth of distinct (transplantable, carcinogen- or oncogene induced) orthotopic NSCLC models. These anticancer effects are linked to increased T lymphocyte infiltration and are abolished by T cell depletion or interferon-γ neutralization. Crizotinib plus cisplatin leads to an increase in the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumors, coupled to a strong sensitization of NSCLC to immunotherapy with PD-1 antibodies. Hence, a sequential combination treatment consisting in conventional chemotherapy together with crizotinib, followed by immune checkpoint blockade may be active against NSCLC."

CD39 was expressed on tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Treg), myeloid cells and some NK cells, and it was upregulated on these cells within tumors early after inoculation in vivo. NK cell numbers and effector functions were increased in globally CD39-deficient mice and also in WT mice treated with POM-1. Dosing with POM-1 suppressed experimental and spontaneous metastases in four different tumor models and was well tolerated. This anti-metastatic activity was completely abrogated in mice, that were depleted of NK cells, had IFNγ neutralized or were deficient in CD39 expression in bone marrow-derived cells. POM-1 was highly effective in suppressing metastases when used in combination with BRAFi/MEKi or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 or IL-2.

The aim of the current study was to examine PD-L1 expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded malignant and nonmalignant cells from human tumors to establish potential characteristic patterns of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues. We used a commercial PD-L1 clone (E1L3N) previously validated in our laboratory to characterize PD-L1 expression in surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas, lung squamous cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and ductal breast carcinomas. We observed different patterns of PD-L1 expression by malignant cells and nonmalignant cells as membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear expression. The distribution of expression was variable including the entire malignant cells population, heterogonous with random distribution, peripheral distribution, minimal expression by few cells and negative expression. Similar, nonmalignant cells showed randomly and peripherally distribution through the tumors. We concluded that the PD-L1 cell protein expression patterns and distributions are variable and differ between resected tumor specimens. The expression and distribution pattern described here provide a useful knowledgment of PD-L1 expression in tumor samples."

In this study, we analysed the localisation and regulation of IL-35 in the lung of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to further elucidate the immune-escape of cancer cells in perioperative course of disease. METHODS: Interleukin 35 (IL-35) was measured by ELISA in postoperative serum from 7 patients with NSCLC as well as 8 samples from healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry, FACS analysis, real-time PCR, as well as western blot from samples of the control (CTR), peri-tumoural (PT) and the tumoural (TU) region of the lung derived from patients with NSCLC and 10 controls were performed. RESULTS: Here we found elevated levels of IL-35 in the TU region as well as postoperative serum from patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Consistently, we found an increased expression of IL-35+Foxp-3+ cells, which associated with ARG1 mRNA expression and decreased TNFA in the TU region of the lung of patients with NSCLC as compared to their CTR region. Furthermore, in the CTR region of the lung of patients with NSCLC, CD68+ macrophages were induced and correlated with IL-35+ cells. Finally, IL-35 positively correlated with TTF-1+PD-L1+ cells in the TU region of NSCLC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Induced IL-35+Foxp3+ cell numbers in the TU region of the lung of patients with NSCLC associated with ARG1 mRNA expression and with TTF-1+PD-L1+ cells. In the tumour-free CTR area, IL-35 correlated with CD68+ macrophages. Thus inhibitors to IL-35 would probably succeed in combination with antibodies against immune checkpoints like PD-L1 and PD-1 currently used against NSCLC because they would inhibit immunosuppressive macrophages and T regulatory cells while promoting T cell-mediated anti-tumoural immune responses in the microenvironment as well as the TU region of NSCLC patients."

METHODS: The clinical features, PD-L1 tumor proportion scores, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (PDi) outcomes (objective response rate and progression-free survival) of patients who had advanced NSCLC with Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations or common, actionable oncogenic drivers were captured. RESULTS: In total, 189 oncogene-positive patients were analyzed. Of these, 104 received a PDi, and 108 had undergone prior PD-L1 testing. The frequency of PD-L1 positivity (≥1%) was higher in patients who had KRAS mutations (P = .031), smokers (P = .006), and non-Asian patients (P = .002). Multivariable analysis indicated that smoking status (P < .001) was the only factor associated significantly with KRAS mutation. The objective response rate to PDi treatment was 16.9% (11 of 65 patients) among smokers (17.3% in the KRAS-mutant and 15.4% in the non-KRAS-mutant smoker subgroups), which was significantly higher than the 0% rate (0 of 26 patients; P = .019) among never-smokers. In subgroup analyses, progression-free survival was influenced by KRAS mutation status (median, 4.57 vs 1.63 months; P = .004), smoking status (4.07 vs 1.73 months; P = .004), PD-L1 positivity (3.8 vs 1.2 months; P = .040), and non-Asian race (3.0 vs 1.97 months; P = .046). In multivariable analysis, only smoking status (P = .008) remained a significant predictor when a PD-L1 level ≥1% was used. However, both smoking status (P = .001) and PD-L1 status (P = .028) were independent predictors when a PD-L1 level ≥50% was used.

Judicious dosing of antiangiogenic agents such as apatinib (VEGFR2-TKI) can modulate the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, which contributes to resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. We therefore hypothesized that inhibiting angiogenesis could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Here, using a syngeneic lung cancer mouse model, we demonstrated that low-dose apatinib alleviated hypoxia, increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells, reduced recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages in tumor and decreased TGFβ amounts in both tumor and serum. Combining low-dose apatinib with anti-PD-L1 significantly retarded tumor growth, reduced the number of metastases, and prolonged survival in mouse models. Anticancer activity was evident after coadministration of low-dose apatinib and anti-PD-1 in a small cohort of patients with pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Preplanned biomarker analysis was performed as part of a phase II clinical trial (NCT02607631) in patients with metastatic or refractory thymic epithelial tumors (TETs; n = 31) who received pembrolizumab. The biomarker was further tested in an independent cohort of prospectively recruited patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received pembrolizumab or nivolumab (NSCLC cohort 1; n = 33) and validated in an independent cohort of patients with NSCLC (NSCLC cohort 2; n = 46). Peripheral blood samples were obtained immediately before treatment (D0) and 7 days after the first dose (D7) and analyzed using multi-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: A higher fold-change in the percentage of Ki-67+ cells among PD-1+CD8+ T cells 7 days after the first dose (Ki-67D7/D0) significantly predicted durable clinical benefit (DCB; P < 0.001) and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; P = 0.027) in patients with TETs. Ki-67D7/D0 ≥ 2.8 was also associated with better DCB, PFS, and overall survival (OS) in NSCLC cohort 1 (all P < 0.05). Ki-67D7/D0 was subsequently validated in NSCLC cohort 2, and Ki-67D7/D0 ≥ 2.8 significantly predicted better DCB (P = 0.001), PFS (P = 0.002), and OS (P = 0.037). Ki-67D7/D0 had a low correlation with tumor PD-L1 expression and combining both factors did not improve the predictive power of Ki-67D7/D0. CONCLUSIONS: The proliferative response of peripheral blood PD-1+CD8+ T cells, measured as the fold-change in the percentage of Ki-67+ cells 7 days after treatment (Ki-67D7/D0), may be a useful surrogate biomarker for predicting the response and prognosis to anti-PD-1 therapy in solid tumors.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research."

To design optimal combination strategies, a better understanding of the immune-modulatory capacities of conventional treatments is needed. Therefore, we investigated the immune-modulatory effects of paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab (PCB), focusing on the immune populations associated with the response to checkpoint inhibitors in peripheral blood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 223 patients with stage IV NSCLC, enrolled in the NVALT12 study, received PCB, with or without nitroglycerin patch. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline and after the first and second treatment cycle, proportions of T cells, B cells, and monocytes were determined by flow cytometry. Furthermore, several subsets of T cells and the expression of Ki67 and coinhibitory receptors on these subsets were determined. RESULTS: Although proliferation of CD4 T cells remained stable following treatment, proliferation of peripheral blood CD8 T cells was significantly increased, particularly in the effector memory and CD45RA+ effector subsets. The proliferating CD8 T cells more highly expressed programmed death receptor (PD)-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) compared with nonproliferating CD8 T cells. Immunologic responders (iR; >2 fold increased proliferation after treatment) did not show an improved progression-free (PFS) or overall survival (OS). CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab induces proliferation of CD8 T cells, consisting of effector cells expressing coinhibitory checkpoint molecules.

Inhibitors of the most established immune checkpoints such as programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in the management of lung cancer. Despite the pronounced survival benefits that have been seen with immune checkpoint inhibitors, not all lung cancer patients respond to single-agent immunotherapy due to the complexity of the immune microenvironment and tumor resistance. Alternative immune checkpoints beyond PD-1/PD-L1 must be sought so that more patients can benefit from immune checkpoint therapy. Additionally, novel combination strategies of immunotherapy and conventional treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy) have shown promise in some clinical trials. Meanwhile, identification of predictive biomarkers is pivotal in selecting eligible patients for immunotherapy and to guide individualized clinical decision-making. The future of immune checkpoint therapy in lung cancer is not devoid of challenges, and more prospective clinical studies are awaited to translate our understanding from bench to bedside."

Equally CD47 is a critical dont eat me signal to the innate immune system and a regulator of the adaptive immune response. METHOD: Both of CD47 and PD-L1 are overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells to enable to escape immune-surveillance. We designed EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule)-targeted cationic liposome (LPP-P4-Ep) containing si-CD47 and si-PD-L1 could target high-EpCAM cancer cells and knockdown both CD47 and PD-L1 proteins. FINDINGS: Efficient silencing of CD47 and PD-L1 versus single gene silencing in vivo by systemic administration of LPP-P4-Ep could significantly inhibited the growth of solid tumors in subcutaneous and reduced lung metastasis in lung metastasis model.

The immune checkpoint inhibitors are a class of medications that block cell signaling and allow the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 inhibitors have been approved as treatment options in many different types of localized and advanced malignancies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can be associated with unique side effects known as immune-related adverse events. Side effects most commonly occur in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and endocrine glands but can affect other organ systems as well."

Survival data obtained from clinical trials shape the cut-offs and IHC scoring that serve as recommendations for patient selection both for targeted and conventional therapies. Assessment of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors along with HER2 status has been among the first approved immunostaining assays revolutionizing breast cancer treatment. Similarly, ALK positivity predicts the efficacy of ALK inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In recent years, Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC assays have been approved as companion or complimentary diagnostic tools predicting the response to checkpoint inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have inaugurated a new period in the treatment of advanced cancers, but the path to approval of these biomarkers is filled with immunohistochemical challenges. The latter brings to the fore the significance of molecular pathology as a hub between basic and clinical research. Besides, novel markers are translated into routine practice, suggesting that we are at the beginning of a new exciting period. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular homeostasis unfolds biomarkers with greater specificity and sensitivity. The introduction of GL13 (SenTraGor®) for the detection of senescent cells in archival material, the implementation of key players of stress response pathways and the development of compounds detecting common mutant P53 isoforms in dictating oncological treatments are paradigms for precision oncology."

We explored the relationship of PD-L1 and malignant behavior in 77 cases of PCC/PGL using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess protein expression and RNAscope to detect mRNA expression in 20 cases. The IHC data showed that 59.74% of the PCCs/PGLs expressed PD-L1, and the extent of expression was highly correlated with Ki-67 (P = .019) and hypertension (P = .013) but not with age, sex, tumor size, capsular invasion, tumor necrosis, relapse/distant metastasis, secretion of noradrenaline/adrenaline/dopamine, or diabetes mellitus. In addition, we found an excellent correlation of PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression with a κ coefficient of 0.828, and further stratification of the IHC and RNAscope findings showed high consistency (Pearson coefficient 0.753). The correlation of PD-L1 and Ki-67 indicated that PD-L1 could be considered a malignant proliferation biomarker for PCCs/PGLs, which would be a putative biomarker for anti-PD-L1 therapies."

However, therapeutic resistance is increasingly observed, and the mechanisms underlying anti-PD-L1 (aPD-L1) antibody treatment have not been clarified yet. Here, we identified two unique secreted PD-L1 splicing variants, which lacked the transmembrane domain, from aPD-L1-resistant NSCLC patients. These secreted PD-L1 variants worked as decoys of aPD-L1 antibody in the HLA-matched coculture system of iPSC-derived CD8 T cells and cancer cells. Importantly, mixing only 1% MC38 cells with secreted PD-L1 variants and 99% of cells that expressed wild-type PD-L1 induced resistance to PD-L1 blockade in the MC38 syngeneic xenograft model. Moreover, anti-PD-1 (aPD-1) antibody treatment overcame the resistance mediated by the secreted PD-L1 variants. Collectively, our results elucidated a novel resistant mechanism of PD-L1 blockade antibody mediated by secreted PD-L1 variants.© 2019 Gong et al."

Unfortunately, the management of steroid-refractory immune mediated adverse events is based on a paucity of randomized data and limited to single center experiences. Our initial experience with the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab showed clinical improvement in a wide variety of irAEs. As a result, we adopted the use of tocilizumab for the management of steroid refractory irAEs. METHODS: The character and clinical course of irAEs were abstracted from the medical record and analyzed. The dose of tocilizumab was 4 mg/kg given IV over one hour. C-reactive protein was drawn at first nivolumab infusion and at q two weeks (and with irAEs) thereafter. Clinical improvement was defined as either: documentation of resolution of symptoms or hospital discharge within seven days. RESULTS: Of the initial 87 patients that were treated with nivolumab, 34 required tocilizumab (39.1%). All patients were on corticosteroids. The majority (88.2%) were lung cancer patients. The index grade 3/4 irAE was pneumonitis in 35.3%, serum sickness/SIRS in 35.3%, cerebritis in 14.7% and one case each of hypophysitis, colitis, pancreatitis, hepatitis and immune mediated coagulopathy. Median time between first nivolumab and initiation of tocilizumab was 76 days (range 1-429). There was a statistically significant increase in C-reactive protein from a median of 23 mg/L (range 0.1-238.5) at baseline to 109.3 mg/L (21.5-350.4) at the time of index irAE, followed by a decrease to 19.2 mg/L (0.25-149) after tocilizumab ( p < 0.00001). Clinical improvement was noted in 27/34 patients (79.4%). Some patients (52.9%) required a single dose, while 38.2% required two, 8.8% required three and 1 patient required four doses. Twenty-seven doses were given in the inpatient setting (49.1%). Median time to discharge was four days (range 1-27). Seventy-four percent of patients were discharged home. For the 53 doses of tocilizumab that were delivered when infliximab was an option, there was a cost savings of $141,048.72 (WAC) during the 18 month study period. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab may be a therapeutic option for the management of steroid refractory irAEs secondary to immune checkpoint blockade. However, randomized trials are needed to better elucidate the relative efficacy and safety of these agents."

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. Methods: We analyzed the clinicopathological data of 44 cases of advanced NSCLC targeted with ICIs in our hospital, between February 2016 and February 2018, in order to determine the prognostic factors of ICIs. We also reviewed the literature regarding ICIs. Result: We retrospectively analyzed the 44 cases (26 nivolumab and 18 pembrolizumab cases). These patients were 38 men and 6 women, comprising 13 cases of adenocarcinoma, 29 squamous cell carcinoma and 2 unclassified types. Seven patients were using first-line therapy and while the others were using second-line therapy or later. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutations were negative in all the cases. The response rate and disease control rate were 20.5% and 51.3%, respectively. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 146 days and 257 days, respectively. We observed five severe adverse effects (AEs) (three cases of interstitial pneumonia, one of liver dysfunction and one of adrenal failure), that were resolved by steroid pulse therapy. In multivariate analyses, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), pathological type, standardized uptake value (SUV) on positron emission tomography (PET), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and albumin were independently prognostic factors. There were no significant differences in the prognosis between nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Conclusions: ICIs were effective in 44 treated NSCLC cases. Our analysis suggests that while ICIs are effective in treating patients, candidates must be carefully selected and cautiously observed."

Here, we aimed to investigate the predictive and prognostic value of blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive online search to explore the association between blood NLR and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in NSCLC patients received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Published data including hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were eligible. Pooled estimates of treatment outcomes were calculated using Stata/MP 14.1. RESULTS: 1700 patients from sixteen studies were included. The pooled results suggested that high blood NLR was correlated with significantly shorter OS (HR = 2.07, P < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 1.59, P < 0.001). The predictive and prognostic significance of blood NLR were observed consistently across most subgroups including publication year, study design, research region, PD-L1 expression detection, sample size, NLR cutoff, median follow-up time and study quality score. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between elevated NLR cutoff values and OS benefit (r = 0.585, P =  0.036) but not for PFS benefit (r = 0.198, P =  0.496). Notably, HRs of PFS showed significant correlation with HRs of OS (r = 0.686, P =  0.041). CONCLUSION: Elevated blood NLR was associated with shorter PFS and OS in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting its potential predictive and prognostic value in this clinical scenario."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria stipulated histologically/cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC and treatment failure on ≥1 prior systemic therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted therapy for patients with EGFR/ALK aberrations). In the dose-finding cohort, patients initially received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 or 3 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy for up to 2 years. Based on emerging published data, subsequent patients received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg. Objective response rate (ORR; primary efficacy endpoint) was assessed per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded, independent central review. Phase 2 hypothesis that ORR would be greater than the 20% rate for historical controls was evaluated using the exact binomial test. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled; 71% received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at any dose level. Among patients who received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 44), ORR was 30% (95% CI, 17%-45%), but not statistically significantly >20% (P = 0.0858). Median progression-free survival in this group was 4.1 (95% CI, 1.4-5.8) months; median overall survival was 10.9 (95% CI, 6.1-23.7) months. With pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, incidences of treatment-related adverse events, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events, and immune-mediated adverse events and infusion reactions were 64%, 29%, and 42%, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data including ANA status were reviewed retrospectively for patients with advanced NSCLC who received monotherapy with a PD-1 inhibitor. RESULTS: Of the 83 patients analyzed, 18 (21.7%) were positive for ANA. The incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) did not differ significantly between patients with ANA (6/18, 33.3%) and those negative for ANA (21/65, 32.3%), although it tended to increase as the ANA titer increased. Progression-free survival (2.9 versus 3.8 months, p =  0.03) and overall survival (11.6 versus 15.8 months, p =  0.03) were significantly shorter in patients positive for ANA than in those without ANA. CONCLUSION: PD-1 inhibitors can be administered safely in advanced NSCLC patients positive for ANA without obvious exacerbation of autoimmune disease, although patients with a high titer of such antibodies may warrant close monitoring. However, the presence of ANA might be associated with a poor outcome of such treatment."

The current study aimed to investigate the predictive role of Abx on ICIs treatment in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The impact of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), another medication that can induce dysbacteriosis, was also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of eligible patients who received anti-PD-1-based therapies in our hospital. Tumor responses, patients survival, the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and other baseline variables were examined. The application of Abx or PPIs treatment were also collected. Clinical outcomes and clinicopathologic features were compared according to the status of Abx or PPIs co-administration. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were included. Of them, 20 (18.3%) patients were categorized in Abx-treated group. No major difference in baseline characteristics was observed between Abx-treated and -untreated groups. Concomitant Abx treatment was significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p < 0.0001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.0021). And primary disease progression tended to increase in Abx-treated group (p = 0.092). Yet, the occurrence and grades of irAEs were comparable between two groups. In multivariable analysis, Abx treatment was markedly associated with worse PFS (HR=0.32, 95%CI 0.18-0.59, p < 0.0001) and OS (HR=0.35, 95%CI 0.16-0.77, p = 0.009). Regarding the use of PPIs, no significant difference was observed in clinical outcomes between the patients with or without concomitant PPIs treatment.

However, IDO1 expression has not been well studied in lung adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 and IDO1 expression was evaluated in 261 resected lung adenocarcinomas using tissue microarrays and H-scores (cutoff: 5). We compared IDO1 and PD-L1 expression with clinical features, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, HLA class I molecule expression, molecular alterations, and patient outcomes. There was expression of PD-L1 in 89 (34%) and IDO1 in 74 (29%) cases, with co-expression in 49 (19%). Both PD-L1 and IDO1 were significantly associated with smoking, aggressive pathologic features, and abundant CD8+ and T-bet+ (Th1 marker) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. PD-L1 expression was also associated with preserved HLA class I molecule expression (p = 0.002). Compared to PD-L1+/IDO1+ and PD-L1+ only cases, significantly fewer IDO1+ only cases had abundant CD8+ and T-bet+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (p < 0.001, respectively). PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with EGFR wild-type (p < 0.001) and KRAS mutants (p = 0.021), whereas isolated IDO1 expression was significantly associated with EGFR mutations (p = 0.007). As for survival, PD-L1 was a significant predictor of decreased progression-free and overall survival by univariate but not multivariate analysis, while IDO1 was not associated with progression-free or overall survival. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the 5-year progression-free and overall survival (p = 0.004 and 0.038, respectively), where cases without PD-L1 or IDO1 expression had the longest survival, and those with PD-L1 alone had the shortest survival. While PD-L1+/-IDO1 expression is observed in association with HLA class I expression, cytotoxic T lymphocyte/Th1 microenvironments, EGFR wild-type, and KRAS mutations, isolated IDO1 expression does not demonstrate these associations, suggesting that IDO1 may serve a distinct immunosuppressive role in lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, further investigation of IDO1 may demonstrate its role as a potential biomarker for patients who undergo anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy."

Immunomodulation via checkpoint inhibition has provided encouraging results in non-CNS malignancies, but prediction of responders has proven to be challenging in glioblastoma patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients who have a measurable increase of interferon gamma levels in brain tumor tissue after their first dose of nivolumab, and to evaluate the safety of using brain tumor microdialysis to monitor for immune response while evaluating the safety of the combination of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) and anti-lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) checkpoint inhibition. METHODS: The study design is a single-center, nonrandomized phase 1 clinical trial. Up to 15 adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma will be enrolled with the goal of 10 patients completing the trial over an anticipated 18 mo. Patients will undergo biopsy; placement of microdialysis catheters and lumbar drains; treatment with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition; comprehensive immune biomarker collection; tumor resection; and then treatment with anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibition until progression. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect interferon gamma levels to increase in the brain as measured via microdialysis in treated patients. Based on published reports, microdialysis in this patient population is expected to be safe, and anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 combined will likely have a similar side effect profile to other checkpoint inhibitor combinations. DISCUSSION: The failure of recent trials of immune therapies in glioblastoma underscores the need to appropriately measure response in the treated tissue. This trial may provide insight on indicators of which patients will respond to immune therapy.","Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2018."

METHODS: Retrospective study of patients treated with nivolumab for NSCLC between May 2015 and December 2016; euthyroidism within the 3 months preceding immunotherapy; monitoring of thyroid function tests until stopping nivolumab, death or February 2017. Patients treated with levothyroxine, amiodarone or another immunotherapy were excluded. RESULTS: Among 183 patients treated, 105 fullfilled the inclusion criteria (72 males, median age: 61 years [range: 41-80]). Fifteen patients (14.3%) experienced a thyroid dysfunction; among them, compared to the "control" group (n=90), we found more females (53.3% vs. 27.8%; P=0.07), and younger patients (median age: 56 years vs. 62 years; P=0.02). Thirteen patients had thyrotoxicosis (median onset: 8 weeks), and then hypothyroidism was observed in 5 patients. Isolated hypothyroidism was rare (n=2) and late (median: 30 weeks). Three patients had anti-TPO antibodies. Three patients discontinued immunotherapy transiently due to thyroid dysfunctions. After a median follow-up of 9 months [95% CI, 7.5-10.3], one patient (6.7%) in the "thyroid dysfunctions" group and 30 patients (33.3%) in the "control" group died, with a trend toward a higher overall survival in the "thyroid dysfunctions" group (HR: 0.16 [95% CI, 0.02-1.15]; P=0.07). CONCLUSION: Thyroid dysfunctions (isolated thyrotoxicosis, biphasic thyroiditis and hypothyroidism) were common, and required patients with NSCLC to be screened during nivolumab therapy."

Radiochemotherapy (RCT), mHsp70-targeting NK cells, and programmed death(PD)-1 inhibition were combined to improve the efficacy of tumor-specific immune cells in a non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient. PATIENT: Following simultaneous RCT (64.8 Gy), a patient with inoperable NSCLC (cT4, cN3, cM0, stage IIIb) was treated with 4 cycles of autologous ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated NK cells and the PD-1 antibody nivolumab as a second-line therapy. Blood samples were taken for immunophenotyping during the course of therapy. RESULTS: Adoptive transfer of ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated NK cells after RCT combined with PD-1 blockade is well tolerated and results in superior overall survival (OS). No viable tumor cells but a massive immune cell infiltration in fibrotic tissue was detected after therapy. Neither tumor progression nor distant metastases were detectable by CT scanning 33 months after diagnosis. Therapy response was associated with significantly increased CD3-/NKG2D+/CD94+ NK cell counts, elevated CD8+ to CD4+ T cell and CD3-/CD56bright to CD3-/CD56dim NK cell ratios, and significantly reduced regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: A combined therapy consisting of RCT, mHsp70-targeting NK cells, and PD-1 antibody inhibition is well tolerated, induces anti-tumor immunity, and results in long-term tumor control in one patient with advanced NSCLC. Further, randomized studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this combination therapy."

The purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate whether the therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab is improved as a result of a history of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: From February 2016 to December 2017, 124 consecutive patients were administered nivolumab for pretreated advanced NSCLC. The patients were divided into RT and non-RT groups. RESULTS: Sixty-six (53%) of the 124 patients had been administered RT before the initiation of nivolumab, 52 (42%) received extracranial RT, and 40 (32%) were treated with thoracic RT. The median number of nivolumab cycles was 4 (range: 1-43). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of nivolumab in all patients were 28.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The ORR (36.4%) was significantly higher in patients who had received previous RT than in patients who had not received any RT (19%). The therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab was particularly noteworthy in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma histology administered extracranial RT, with ORRs of 48.3% and 52.6%, and DCRs of 87.1% and 84.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Previous RT was an independent prognostic marker of favorable prognosis after nivolumab administration and improved the response rate to nivolumab treatment. Previous RT was clinically identified to have a synergistic effect with nivolumab treatment, increasing the response rate and improving the outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

Antiangiogenic agents have been shown to stimulate the immune system and cause synergistic effects that stimulate tumor shrinkage. We conducted a retrospective study to evaluate improvement of the efficacy of ramucirumab plus docetaxel after the failure of nivolumab as a PD-1 inhibitor. METHODS: From February 2016 to December 2017, 152 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) administered nivolumab in our institution were identified. We reviewed the records of 20 NSCLC patients administered ramucirumab plus docetaxel after nivolumab failure. The overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were investigated. Pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was prophylactically administered to 18 patients (90%) after the administration of ramucirumab plus docetaxel. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 70 (range: 55-77) years. Twelve patients were male and eight were female. The histology was adenocarcinoma in 16 patients, squamous cell carcinoma in three, and other in one. The ORR of ramucirumab plus docetaxel was 60%, and the PFS and OS were 169 and 343 days, respectively. Among the 20 patients, 12 achieved a partial response, giving an ORR of 60.0%. Six patients had stable disease and two had progressive disease. The disease control rate was 90%. Gastrointestinal adverse events were frequently observed in 19 patients.

METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treated with an anti-PD-1 antibody between December 2015 and March 2018 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Japan, was conducted. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with and without MPE. Additional survival analysis according to PD-L1 expression status was conducted. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients were identified before the commencement of anti-PD-1 antibody treatment: 33 with MPE and 219 without MPE. PFS and OS were significantly shorter in patients with MPE than in patients without MPE (median PFS 3.0 vs. 5.8 months, hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, P = 0.014; median OS 7.9 vs. 15.8 months, HR 2.1, P = 0.001).

In the current immunotherapy era, it is often difficult to evaluate the therapeutic effect, disease progression, and pseudo-enlargement of the tumor or the emergence of another etiology. In the present report, we describe a 79-year-old patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) newly detected during nivolumab treatment for recurrent NSCLC. When the patient was 73 years old, he had suffered from NSCLC and received concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising cisplatin and docetaxel, achieving a complete response. Six years after the chemoradiotherapy, the patient had multiple lung and hepatic lesions. We thus started the treatment with nivolumab for recurrent NSCLC. All those lesions responded to nivolumab over nine cycles. By contrast, a lesion was newly detected in the medial segment of left hepatic lobe, liver segment 4 (S4), and was gradually getting larger, as judged by computed tomographic scan. Liver biopsy revealed the growing lesion to be a well-differentiated HCC. Consequently, the patient was treated with radiofrequency ablation to HCC, while nivolumab treatment was continued for NSCLC. Immunohistochemical analysis of the HCC specimens revealed nuclear accumulation of β-catenin compared with normal liver cells and undetectable expression of program death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Such expression profiles of β-catenin and PD-L1 in HCC may be responsible for the resistance against nivolumab treatment. Immunohistochemical features of the biopsy specimens may be predictive of the effectiveness of the immunotherapy in HCC."

PD-L1 expression detected by immunohistochemistry is the first clinically validated predictive biomarker for response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, though its predictive value varies significantly between tumor types. With the approval of pembrolizumab monotherapy for treatment-naïve, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, PD-L1 testing has to become broadly available in pathology laboratories. When PD-L1 testing started to be introduced in routine pathology practice, there were several open issues, which needed to be addressed in order to provide accurate results. This review will discuss the complex biological background of PD-L1 as predictive biomarker, summarize relevant clinical trials in NSCLC illustrating the origin of different PD-L1 expression cutoffs and scorings, and address issues important for PD-L1 testing including the analytical comparability of the different clinical trial-validated PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays, the potential of laboratory-developed tests, and an overview of the different scoring algorithms."

However, reliable predictive markers of tumor responsiveness are still lacking. These markers need to be urgently identified for a better selection of patients that can be candidates for immunotherapy. In this pilot study, a cohort of 34 consecutive patients bearing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), treated with pembrolizumab, was considered. The retrospective immuno-phenotypic analysis performed on the original tumor biopsies allowed for the identification of a specific "galectin signature", which strongly correlated with tumor responsiveness to anti PD-1 immunotherapy. We observed that the large majority of patients (about 90%) with high galectin-3 tumor expression (score 3+) showed an early and dramatic progression of the disease after three cycles of treatments. In contrast, all patients with negative or low/intermediate expression of galectin-3 in tumor cells showed an early and durable objective response to pembrolizumab, indicating galectin-3 as an interesting predictive marker of tumor responsiveness. The galectin-3 signature, at least in NSCLCs, promises a better selection of patient candidates for immunotherapy, reducing unnecessary treatment exposures and social costs. A large multicenter study is ongoing to validate this finding."

These patients are often treated with palliative radiotherapy (PRT); however, data evaluating the combination of PRT and ICB in patients with vertebral metastases is limited. Furthermore, patients with cord compression are generally excluded from prospective clinical trials. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated outcomes following PRT and PD-1 inhibition in patients with vertebral metastases. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 37 consecutive patients (total 57 lesions) treated with radiation for vertebral metastases who also received PD-1 inhibition. Patient, treatment and outcomes data were abstracted from the medical records. Results: Histologies included non-small cell lung cancer (n = 21), renal cell carcinoma (n = 9) and melanoma (n = 7). Out of 57 lesions,18 involved >1 segments of the vertebral column. There were isolated lesions in thoracic (16), lumbar (9), cervical (6), and sacral (8) vertebrae. Presenting symptoms included pain (19), numbness (10), and weakness (3). Eleven patients were asymptomatic. Radiologic cord compression was present in 12, epidural extension in 28 and compression fracture in 14. Eleven patients underwent surgical decompression prior to the onset of RT. Median radiation dose was 24 Gy (range 8-30 Gy). Stereotactic radiation was delivered in 4 patients; 33 patients received conformal RT. 21 patients received PD-1 inhibition after RT, 9 before RT and 7 with RT. Seven patients received concurrent CTLA-4 inhibitors with anti-PD-1 therapy. Treatment was in general well-tolerated. Toxicities included fatigue (6), transient pain flare (1), nausea/vomiting (1) and G1 skin changes (1). All patients reported some degree of pain relief. Numbness/weakness was improved in 6 of 13 patients with baseline symptoms (46%) and this was more likely in patients that received vertebral radiation after starting PD-1 inhibitors (71 vs. 17%, p = 0.04). Most patients (22 of 33 evaluable patients, 67%) had stability of irradiated lesions on subsequent follow up imaging performed at median of 30 days from RT, whereas 3 had a complete local response and 4 had a partial local response. Conclusions: We demonstrate that PRT administered to vertebral metastases was well-tolerated and effective in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. There was an encouraging rate of pain reduction and neurological improvement."

Combining these immunotherapies with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment has resulted in improved response rates and increased survival when compared to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Certain patient populations may even benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy in the first-line setting. The PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab is approved as monotherapy or in combination with platinum + pemetrexed for most newly diagnosed patients with metastatic NSCLC, excluding those with a targetable oncogene such as ALK and EGFR. The PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab is also approved in combination with bevacizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel for the same population, with some parts of the world also approving this regimen for patients with ALK rearrangements or EGFR activating mutations. However, there are many other chemo-immunotherapy regimens that have been evaluated as initial treatment in metastatic NSCLC.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2011 and July 2017, NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 at a tertiary-care academic cancer center were identified. Patient, treatment, prior RT (intent, technique, timing, courses), and IR pneumonitis details were collected. Treating investigators diagnosed IR pneumonitis clinically. Diagnostic IR pneumonitis scans were overlaid with available chest RT plans to describe IR pneumonitis in relation to prior chest RT. We evaluated associations between patient, treatment, RT details, and development of IR pneumonitis by Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Of the 188 NSCLC patients we identified, median follow-up was 6.78 (range, 0.30-79.3) months and median age 66 (range, 39-91) years; 54% (n = 102) were male; and 42% (n = 79) had stage I-III NSCLC at initial diagnosis. Patients received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy (n = 127, 68%) or PD-1/PD-L1-based combinations (n = 61, 32%). In the entire cohort, 70% (132/188) received any RT, 53% (100/188) chest RT, and 37% (70/188) curative-intent chest RT. Any grade IR pneumonitis occurred in 19% (36/188; 95% confidence interval, 13.8-25.6). Of those who developed IR pneumonitis and received chest RT (n = 19), patients were more likely to have received curative-intent versus palliative-intent chest RT (17/19, 89%, vs. 2/19, 11%; P = .051). Predominant IR pneumonitis appearances were ground-glass opacities outside high-dose chest RT regions. CONCLUSION: No RT parameter was significantly associated with IR pneumonitis. On subset analysis of patients who developed IR pneumonitis and who had received prior chest RT, IR pneumonitis was more common in patients who received curative-intent chest RT. Attention should be paid to NSCLC patients receiving curative-intent RT followed by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents."

We investigated the safety and clinical activity of combining a MEK inhibitor, cobimetinib, and a PD-L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, in patients with solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase I/Ib study treated PD-L1/PD-1-naive patients with solid tumors in a dose-escalation stage and then in multiple, indication-specific dose-expansion cohorts. In most patients, cobimetinib was dosed once daily orally for 21 days on, 7 days off. Atezolizumab was dosed at 800 mg intravenously every 2 weeks. The primary objectives were safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included ORR, PFS and OS. RESULTS: Between 27 December 2013 and 9 May 2016, 152 patients were enrolled. As of 4 September 2017, 150 patients received ≥ 1 dose of atezolizumab, including 14 in the dose-escalation cohorts and 136 in the dose-expansion cohorts. Patients had mCRC (n = 84), melanoma (n = 22), NSCLC (n = 28), and other solid tumors (n = 16). The most common all-grade treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (67%), rash (48%) and fatigue (40%), similar to those with single-agent cobimetinib and atezolizumab. One (< 1%) treatment-related grade 5 AE occurred (sepsis). Forty-five (30%) and 23 patients (15%) had AEs that led to discontinuation of cobimetinib and atezolizumab, respectively. Confirmed responses were observed in 7 of 84 patients (8%) with mCRC (6 responders were microsatellite low/stable, 1 was microsatellite instable), 9 of 22 patients (41%) with melanoma, and 5 of 28 patients (18%) with NSCLC. Clinical activity was independent of KRAS/BRAF status across diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab plus cobimetinib had manageable safety and clinical activity irrespective of KRAS/BRAF status. Although potential synergistic activity was seen in mCRC, this was not confirmed in a subsequent phase III study.© The Author 2019.

However, the limitation of neoantigen identification, low immunogenicity, and weak immune response hamper the development of personalized cancer vaccines. The surgically removed tumor contains tumor antigens specific to the patient, which provides a promising source for personalized cancer vaccines. Here, we utilized the surgically removed tumor to prepare a personalized photothermal vaccine combined with the PD-1 checkpoint blockade antibody to prevent tumor relapse and metastasis. Black phosphorus quantum dot nanovesicles (BPQD-CCNVs) coated with surgically removed tumor cell membrane were prepared and loaded into a thermosensitive hydrogel containing GM-CSF and LPS. The sustained release of GM-CSF from the hypodermic injection of Gel-BPQD-CCNVs effectively recruited dendritic cells to capture tumor antigen. NIR irradiation and LPS stimulated the expansion and activation of DCs, which then traveled to the lymph nodes to present antigen to CD8+ T cells. Moreover, the combination with PD-1 antibody significantly enhanced tumor-specific CD8+ T cell elimination of the surgical residual and lung metastatic tumor. Hence, our work may provide a promising strategy for the clinical development of a personalized cancer vaccine."

PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor tissue serves as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of PD-1 pathway blockade. Here, we evaluated the expression of PD-L1 on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral whole blood (3 mL) was collected from patients, and CTCs and PD-L1 expression were detected using a microcavity array (MCA) system. Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 detection was also performed using matched tumor tissues. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with lung cancer were enrolled in the study between July 2015 and April 2016 at Wakayama Medical University Hospital. The characteristics of the patients were as follows: median age, 71 years (range, 39-86 years); male, 72%; stage II to III/IV, 14%/85%; non-small-cell lung cancer/small-cell lung cancer/other, 73%/21%/6%. CTCs were detected in 66 of 67 patients (median, 19; range, 0-115), and more than 5 CTCs were detected in 78% of patients. PD-L1-expressing CTCs were detected in 73% of patients, and the proportion score of PD-L1-expressing CTCs ranged from 3% to 100%, suggesting intra-patient heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression on CTCs. Tumor tissues were available from 27 patients and were immunostained for PD-L1, and no correlation was observed between tumor tissues and CTCs based on the proportion score (R2 = 0.0103). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 expression was detectable on CTCs in patients with lung cancer, and intra-patient heterogeneity was observed.

Among them, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab have been granted US Food and Drug Administration approval for NSCLC. It is imperative to combine ICIs with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, antivascular therapy and targeted therapy. But in the bright future, there are two problems. One is how to use biomarkers to select the beneficiaries. The other is how to achieve a balance between drug effectiveness and safety. There are now seven drugs targeting the programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) pathways that have been or are expected to enter clinical treatment. This review focuses on these drugs and summarizes clinical trials that have been reported or that ongoing ones have already entered the recruiting state.© The Author(s) 2018.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the antitumor effects of a combined therapy consisting of ex vivo Hsp70-peptide TKD/IL-2-activated NK cells in combination with mouse/human anti-PD-1 antibody in a syngeneic glioblastoma and a xenograft lung cancer mouse model. Mice with membrane Hsp70 positive syngeneic GL261 glioblastoma or human xenograft A549 lung tumors were sham-treated with PBS or injected with ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated mouse/human NK cells and mouse/human PD-1 antibody either as a single regimen or in combination. Tumor volume was assessed by MR scanning and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T, NK, and PD-1+ cells were quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We could show that the adoptive transfer of ex vivo TKD/IL-2-activated mouse NK cells or the inhibition of PD-1 resulted in tumor growth delay and an improved overall survival (OS) in a syngeneic glioblastoma mouse model. A combination of both therapies was well-tolerated and significantly more effective with respect to both outcome parameters than either of the single regimens. A combined treatment in a xenograft lung cancer model showed identical effects in immunodeficient mice bearing human lung cancer after adoptive transfer of TKD/IL-2-activated human effector cells and a human PD-1 antibody. Tumor control was associated with a massive infiltration with CD8+ T and NK cells in both tumor models and a decreased in PD-1 expression on immune effector cells. In summary, a combined approach consisting of activated NK cells and anti-PD-1 therapy is safe and results in a long-term tumor control which is accompanied by a massive tumor immune cell infiltration in 2 preclinical tumor models."

[Epub ahead of print]","Predicting Response to Cancer Immunotherapy using Non-invasive Radiomic Biomarkers.","INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy is regarded one of the major breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds - urging the quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are related to and may therefore act as non-invasive radiomic biomarkers for immunotherapy response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We performed a AI-based characterization of each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and validate a non-invasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing between immunotherapy responding and non-responding. To define the biological basis of the radiographic biomarker, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis in an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients. RESULTS: The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to 0.83 AUC, p < 0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64 AUC, p = 0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level, immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both cancer types (p < 0.001), resulting in a one year survival difference of 24% (p = 0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and preferential response to immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions on standard-of-care imaging may function as non-invasive biomarkers for response to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.© The Author 2019.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether lycopene could promote the effect of anti-PD-1 treatment on lung cancer. Methods: Tumor formation assay was conducted. Immune reactions were assessed by detecting several cytokine levels using enzyme-like immunosorbent assay. T cell activity was analyzed using cytometry. The mechanism of lycopene action was investigated using Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite sequencing analysis. Results: After the mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were sacrificed, we found that combined lycopene and anti-PD-1 reduced the tumor volume and weight compared to control treatment. Cell apoptosis in the tumor tissues was significantly enhanced in mice with combined lycopene and anti-PD-1 treatment in comparison with those of either lycopene or anti-PD-1 alone. Furthermore, lycopene could assist anti-PD-1 to elevate the levels of interleukin (IL)-1 and interferon (IFN) γ while reduce the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in the spleen of mice injected with LLC cells. Lycopene treatment increased the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the spleen and promoted IFNγ-expressing CD8+ T cells in tumor tissues. Upon IFNγ stimulation, lycopene diminished PD-L1 expression via activating JAK and repressing phosphorylation of AKT. Conclusion: Our results have demonstrated that lycopene could be used as a potential adjuvant drug to synergistically improve the efficiency of anti-PD-1 therapy."

N-803, formerly ALT-803, is an IL-15 superagonist mutant and dimeric IL-15RαSushi-Fc fusion protein complex that enhances CD8+ T and NK cell expansion and function and exhibits anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical models. Previous in vitro studies have shown that IL-15 increases PD-L1 expression, a negative regulator of CD8+ T and NK cell function. Most reported preclinical studies administered N-803 intraperitoneally not subcutaneously, the current clinical route of administration. N-803 is now being evaluated clinically in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. However, the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. Here, we examined the anti-tumor efficacy and immunomodulatory effects of combining N-803 with an anti-PD-L1 antibody in preclinical models of solid carcinomas refractory to anti-PD-L1 or N-803. METHODS: Subcutaneous N-803 and an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody were administered as monotherapy or in combination to 4T1 triple negative breast and MC38-CEA colon tumor-bearing mice. Anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated, and a comprehensive analysis of the immune-mediated effects of each therapy was performed on the primary tumor, lung as a site of metastasis, and spleen. RESULTS: We demonstrate that N-803 treatment increased PD-L1 expression on immune cells in vivo, supporting the combination of N-803 and anti-PD-L1. N-803 plus anti-PD-L1 was well-tolerated, reduced 4T1 lung metastasis and MC38-CEA tumor burden, and increased survival as compared to N-803 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies. Efficacy of the combination therapy was dependent on both CD8+ T and NK cells and was associated with increased numbers of these activated immune cells in the lung and spleen. Most alterations to NK and CD8+ T cell phenotype and number were driven by N-803. However, the addition of anti-PD-L1 to N-803 significantly enhanced CD8+ T cell effector function versus N-803 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies, as indicated by increased Granzyme B and IFNγ production, at the site of metastasis and in the periphery. Increased CD8+ T cell effector function correlated with higher serum IFNγ levels, without related toxicities, and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of the N-803 plus anti-PD-L1 combination versus either monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel insight into the mechanism of action of N-803 plus anti-PD-L1 combination and offer preclinical proof of concept supporting clinical use of N-803 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, including for patients non- and/or minimally responsive to either monotherapy."

This analysis helps to illuminate the role of immune surveillance across a broad range of malignancies and compares the incidence of cancers due to virally mediated oncogenesis (lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the aerodigestive epithelium, and hepatitis-induced liver cancer) with the incidence of other malignancies. The authors central finding is that cancer-specific mortality is significantly increased in SOT recipients in comparison with nontransplant recipients for multiple cancers, and the increased cancer incidence is not limited to the effects of viral oncogenesis. The authors document a significant increase in common epithelial malignancies that are currently treated with immune checkpoint antibodies, including melanoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, cancers of the oral cavity/pharynx, kidney cancer, and lung cancer, and this supports the hypothesis that post-SOT immunosuppression affects immune surveillance in these cancers. Provocatively, the authors also document increases in the incidence and mortality of cancers not typically responsive to immune checkpoint therapies, including breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. The findings of DArcy et al suggest that immune surveillance controls oncogenesis and tumor progression in a broad range of malignancies and that breast cancer and pancreatic cancer could be sensitive to drugs targeting immune surveillance pathways other than those treated with currently Food and Drug Administration-approved antibodies to CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1.© 2019 American Cancer Society."

Here, we report that ultrasensitive measures of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and T-cell expansion can be used to assess responses to immune checkpoint blockade in metastatic lung cancer patients (N = 24). Patients with clinical response to therapy had a complete reduction in ctDNA levels after initiation of therapy, whereas nonresponders had no significant changes or an increase in ctDNA levels. Patients with initial response followed by acquired resistance to therapy had an initial drop followed by recrudescence in ctDNA levels. Patients without a molecular response had shorter progression-free and overall survival compared with molecular responders [5.2 vs. 14.5 and 8.4 vs. 18.7 months; HR 5.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.57-18.35; P = 0.007 and HR 6.91; 95% CI, 1.37-34.97; P = 0.02, respectively], which was detected on average 8.7 weeks earlier and was more predictive of clinical benefit than CT imaging. Expansion of T cells, measured through increases of T-cell receptor productive frequencies, mirrored ctDNA reduction in response to therapy. We validated this approach in an independent cohort of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (N = 14), where the therapeutic effect was measured by pathologic assessment of residual tumor after anti-PD1 therapy. Consistent with our initial findings, early ctDNA dynamics predicted pathologic response to immune checkpoint blockade. These analyses provide an approach for rapid determination of therapeutic outcomes for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and have important implications for the development of personalized immune targeted strategies.Significance: Rapid and sensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA dynamic changes and T-cell expansion can be used to guide immune targeted therapy for patients with lung cancer.See related commentary by Zou and Meyerson, p. 1038.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research."

It is unclear if the flu vaccine exacerbates immune events in patients treated with ICIs. METHODS: We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective review of advanced cancer patients on ICIs who received the flu vaccine during three consecutive seasons; 2014-15, 15-16, and 16-17. The primary outcome assessed was any new onset immune-related adverse event (IRAE). A subset analysis of vaccinated patients newly treated with anti PD-1 agents (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) was conducted to assess overall IRAE rates for comparison with published clinical trials. RESULTS: During the three seasons, 370 patients met criteria for ICI and vaccination within ~ two months (65 days). The most common underlying cancers were lung (46%) and melanoma (19%); 61% of patients received anti PD-1 agent only. In the entire cohort, 20% experienced an IRAE (any grade); incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity was 8%. No grade 5 events occurred. In the subset of 170 patients newly treated with anti PD-1 agents, overall IRAE rate was 18%, grade 3/4 events occurred in 7.6%. Influenza was diagnosed in 2 patients. CONCLUSION: No increase in incidence or severity of IRAE was detected in patients on ICIs who received the inactivated influenza vaccine within ~ 2 months of ICI. For newly treated patients on anti-PDI agents, IRAE rates were comparable to published clinical trials and did not vary with order of administration.

The use of next generation sequencing (NGS) may help in identification of germline mutations in genes involved in a common etiology for both tumors thus allowing a common effective therapeutic strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the unexpected positive results obtained in a young woman with relapsed chemo-resistant stage IVB cervical and synchronous stage IV lung cancer, who underwent an interdisciplinary approach including palliative surgery with laparoscopic total pelvic exenteratio followed by a chemo-immunotherapy protocol with the anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1 antibody nivolumab plus metronomic cyclophosphamide. The treatment choice was based on tumor PD-Ligand 1 assessment and NGS analysis for the identification of potential treatment targets. Outcomes included tumor objective response and patient-centered outcomes (pain, performance status and overall quality of life). RESULTS: Laparoscopic surgery obtained an immediate symptom control and allowed the early start of medical treatment. One month after combined therapy start the patient achieved a significant improvement in performance status, pain, overall Quality of life and after 3 months she resumed working. After 3 and 6 months of treatment we observed an objective dimensional and metabolic response. Currently, after 24 months (and 48 cycles of nivolumab) the patient is continuing to benefit from treatment: she is in complete remission, with good performance status and she is working and leading a self-dependent life. CONCLUSION: Our study strongly affirms the efficacy of an interdisciplinary approach including surgical and innovative medical strategies based on immunotherapy in patients with advanced chemo-resistant synchronous cervical and lung cancer. The present findings support the use of NGS to drive a targeted rational treatment especially in heavily pre-treated patients."

The medical records of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were obtained from the outpatient department or inpatient department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from August 1, 2015, to January 1, 2018. Our follow-up continued until May 1,2018. We chose overall survival (OS) as the primary observation endpoint and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety as the secondary observation endpoints. Efficacy was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and we compared the influence of different factors on PFS and OS by the log-rank test. The median follow-up time was 11 months. At the end of the follow-up, 24 patients (61.5%) were still undergoing immunotherapy, and 7 patients (17.9%) had died. Twenty-six cases (66.7%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line treatment, and 7 cases (17.9%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as second-line treatment. Only 6 cases (15.4%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as third-line treatment. Therapeutic effect evaluation: Complete response (CR): 1 case (2.6%). Partial response (PR): 10 cases (25.6%). Stable disease (SD): 16 cases (41.0%). Progressive disease (PD): 12 cases (30.8%). The ORR was 28.2%, and DCR was 69.2%. The median PFS was 25.5 months (95% CI 6.8-44.1 months), which failed to reach the median OS. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in a real-world setting than in clinical trials; PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for people who are over 70 than for people who are under 70. Additionally, patients who are over 75 years old have a higher response rate, suggesting that elderly patients may receive more benefits from immunotherapy; Patients who have an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (+) may benefit from immunotherapy after treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is essential to identify these potential patients from the entire patient pool; PD-1 may have a certain curative effect on brain metastases from NSCLC. Local radiotherapy may help to improve PD-1 intracranial efficacy."

We have previously shown that adoptive transfer of double negative T (DNT) cells expanded from healthy donors can target leukemia but their role in treating established lung cancer is not clear. Here we explore the role of human DNT cells in targeting late-stage established lung cancer either alone or in combination with Nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) and describe underlying mechanisms. METHODS: DNT cells from resected lung cancer tissue of patients were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine their infiltration and PD-1 expression. Expansion capacity and anti-tumor function of lung cancer patient and healthy donor DNT cells were compared. Late-stage lung cancer xenograft models were developed to determine the anti-tumor effect of DNT cells alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, and the level of tumor-infiltrating DNT cells was quantified by histology and characterized by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Patient-derived tumor infiltrating lymphocytes contained a lower frequency of DNT cells with a higher expression of PD-1 relative to normal lung tissue. Ex vivo expanded patient- and healthy donor-derived DNT cells showed similar levels of cytotoxicity against lung cancer cells in vitro. Healthy donor-derived DNT cells significantly inhibited the growth of late-stage lung cancer xenografts, which was further augmented by anti-PD-1 through increased DNT cell tumor infiltration. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of DNT cells for adoptive cellular therapy against lung cancer either alone or in combination with anti-PD-1."

Here we report that cigarette smoke and the carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) induce PD-L1 expression on lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, which is mediated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Anti-PD-L1 antibody or deficiency in AhR significantly suppresses BaP-induced lung cancer. In 37 patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab, 13/16 (81.3%) patients who achieve partial response or stable disease express high levels of AhR, whereas 12/16 (75%) patients with progression disease exhibit low levels of AhR in tumor tissues. AhR inhibitors exert significant antitumor activity and synergize with anti-PD-L1 antibody in lung cancer mouse models. These results demonstrate that tobacco smoke enables lung epithelial cells to escape from adaptive immunity to promote tumorigenesis, and AhR predicts the response to immunotherapy and represents an attractive therapeutic target."

Based on the correlation of programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) and EGFR signaling pathway, whether continuous TKIs treatment will affect PD-L1 expression after disease progression remains unclear. To investigate the potential change of PD-L1 expression in TKI-resistant NSCLC after continuous TKIs treatment, we treated H1975 and HCC827 for more than one month and explored the possible effect on immune cells as well as underlying biological mechanisms. We found that continuous exposure to TKIs induced upregulation of PD-L1 in H1975 and HCC827. Moreover, PD-L1 upregulation significantly inhibited proliferation and slightly promoted apoptosis of T cells. We observed the activation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 along with the PD-L1 upregulation. With the pathway inhibitors, we found ERK1/2 pathway involved in inducing PD-L1 in resistant lung cancer. This study provides preclinical evidence that continuous TKIs treatment may induce PD-L1 expression in resistant NSCLC, resulting in the suppression of T cell function and immune escape. ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors, PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors or combination strategies should be considered to reverse the resistance to TKIs in NSCLC patients."

Nearly all organs can be affected by immune-related toxicities. However, the most frequently reported are: fatigue, rash, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, arthralgia, decreased appetite and abdominal pain. Although these adverse events are usually mild, reversible and not frequent, an early diagnosis is crucial. Immune-related pulmonary toxicity was most frequently observed in trials of lung cancer and of melanoma patients treated with the combination of the anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 and the anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies. The most frequent immune-related adverse event in the lung is represented by pneumonitis due to the development of infiltrates in the interstitium and in the alveoli. Clinical symptoms and radiological patterns are the key elements to be considered for an early diagnosis, rendering the differential diagnosis crucial. Diagnosis of immune-related pneumonitis may imply the temporary or definitive suspension of immunotherapy, along with the start of immuno-suppressive treatments.

Additionally, we detected inflammation and immune indicators. The result showed that SFI administration could reduce depressive-like behaviors in tumor-bearing mice and inhibit tumor growth. In addition, SFI might improve fatigue symptoms by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by peripheral immune cells, restrain the dysfunction of exhausted T cells and improve the anti-tumor immunity through the targets of PDL1, TIM3 and FOXP3.

All 20 patients tested for the mismatch repair status had mismatch repair-proficient tumors, and the response rate was 30.0% (95% confidence interval, 11.9%-54.3%). Patients with a higher mutation load (4 of 10) tended to have better responses than those with fewer mutations (2 of 10), but the difference was not significant (P = .628). Patients with a >10% relative increase from the baseline LDH level were more likely to experience disease progression (90% [9 of 10]) than patients with a ≤10% change (40% [8 of 20]; P = .017).

Additionally, metformin has been linked to favorable outcomes in tumors. Many researchers have reported immune-mediated adverse events induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) single agent. However, little is documented on the adverse events of the combined use of ICI and metformin. METHODS: To address this question, we used the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to display the landscape of adverse events associated with the combined use of ICI and metformin. We identified 38 adverse event cases about the combination treatment between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2018. RESULTS: There are 36 cases in patients receiving nivolumab plus metformin (NM) therapy, and the other 2 cases were pembrolizumab plus metformin (PM). Among the 36 patients receiving NM therapy, the most common indication was for treatment of malignant lung cancer (20, 55.56%), Notably, 9 cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and diarrhea were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that higher risk of IBD might occur in lung cancer patients during the combined therapy of nivolumab plus metformin. Further studies are needed to verify our findings."

Despite the variable definition of PD-L1 positivity in tumors, an association between expression and response has been reasonably consistent in advanced NSCLC. In addition, the clinical efficacy of ICIs seems to be related to the genomic landscape of the tumor in terms of mutational burden and clonal neoantigens. Furthermore, increasing evidence shows that excessive activation of the immune response elicited by ICIs, leading to immune-related toxicities, might be associated with an improved response to immunotherapy. There are still many unanswered questions about the proper use of these agents to maximize their efficacy, which may be improved through combination with radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, or other immune mediators, including dual checkpoint blockade. To search for clues for addressing these challenges, this review focused on the characteristics and clinical features of long-term NSCLC survivors and the potential biomarkers of response to ICIs."

PD-L1 is a co-inhibitory molecule whose expression on the surface of tumor cells is associated with worse prognosis in many tumors. Here we describe a splice variant (secPD-L1) that does not splice into the transmembrane domain, but instead produces a secreted form of PD-L1 that has a unique 18 amino acid tail containing a cysteine that allows it to homodimerize and more effectively inhibit lymphocyte function than monomeric soluble PD-L1. We show that recombinant secPD-L1 can dimerize and inhibit T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production in vitro. The secPD-L1 variant is expressed by malignant cells in vitro that also express high levels of full-length PD-L1. Transcriptomic analysis of gene expression across The Cancer Genome Atlas found the strongest association of secPD-L1 with full-length PD-L1, but also with subsets of immunologic genes, such as in myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Moreover, the splice variant is also expressed in normal tissues and within normal peripheral blood cells it is preferentially expressed in activated myeloid cells. This is the first report of a form of secreted PD-L1 that homodimerizes and is functionally active. SecPD-L1 may function as a paracrine negative immune regulator within the tumor, since secPD-L1 does not require a cell-to-cell interaction to mediate its inhibitory effect."

However, only a subset of patients respond to this treatment, warranting a greater understanding of the biological mechanisms driving immune evasion via PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and other T-cell suppressive pathways. We previously identified a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with human papillomavirus integration in the PD-L1 locus upstream of the transmembrane domain-encoding region, suggesting expression of a truncated form of PD-L1 (Parfenov et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111(43):15544-15549, 2014). In this study, we extended this observation by performing a computational analysis of 33 other cancer types as well as human cancer cell lines, and identified additional PD-L1 isoforms with an exon 4 enrichment expressed in 20 cancers and human cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that cancer cell lines with high expression levels of exon 4-enriched PD-L1 generate a secreted form of PD-L1. Further biochemical studies of exon 4-enriched PD-L1 demonstrated that this form is secreted and maintains the capacity to bind PD-1 as well as to serve as a negative regulator on T cell function, as measured by inhibition of IL-2 and IFNg secretion. Overall, we have demonstrated that truncated forms of PD-L1 exist in numerous cancer types, and have validated that truncated PD-L1 can be secreted and negatively regulate T cell function."

Improvements are obtained with IL2/anti-IL2 complexes (IL2Cx), which redirect IL2 action to CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of combining IL2Cx with blockade of inhibitory immune pathways. In an autochthonous lung adenocarcinoma model, we show that the IL2Cx/anti-PD-1 combination increases CD8+ T-cell infiltration of the lung and controls tumor growth. In the B16-OVA model, which is resistant to checkpoint inhibition, combination of IL2Cx with PD-1 or CTLA-4 pathway blockade reverses that resistance. Both combinations work by reinvigorating exhausted intratumoral CD8+ T cells and by increasing the breadth of tumor-specific T-cell responses. However, only the IL2Cx/anti-CTLA-4 combination is able to rescue NK cell antitumor function by modulating intratumoral regulatory T cells. Overall, association of IL2Cx with PD-1 or CTLA-4 pathway blockade acts by different cellular mechanisms, paving the way for the rational design of combinatorial antitumor therapies.©2019 American Association for Cancer Research."

Patients received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks for 2 years or until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. Primary objectives were to evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥1% and the objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST version 1.1 in patients with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled and received ≥1 pembrolizumab dose. The median (range) age was 66.0 (41-78) years, and 61% had received ≥2 prior systemic therapies. Eleven patients (29%) experienced grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (AE); 9 patients (24%) experienced immune-mediated AE and infusion reactions, with pneumonitis (11%; any grade) being most common.

The increasing use of programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer and in other malignancies means clinicians have to face up to new challenges in managing immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which often resemble autoimmune diseases. Neurological irAEs represent an emerging toxicity related to immunotherapy, and it is mandatory to know how to monitor, recognize, and manage them, since they can rapidly lead to patient death if untreated. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of these irAEs have been recently published but sharing some of the most unusual clinical cases is crucial, in our opinion, to improve awareness and to optimize the approach for these patients. A literature review on the diagnosis and treatment of immune-related neurotoxicitys has been conducted starting from the report of four cases of neurological irAEs regarding cases of polyneuropathy, myasthenia gravis, Bells palsy, and encephalopathy, all of which occurred in oncological patients receiving PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) for the treatment of non-oncogene addicted advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The exclusion of other differential diagnoses and the correlation between the suspension of immunotherapy and improvement of symptoms suggest that immunotherapy could be the cause of the neurological disorders reported."

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profile of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was explored in a dataset of 16,000 samples, including approximately 4,000 metastatic tumors, across >25 tumor types prevalent in the United States, looking for new indications for the programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab. PD-L1 expression was highly concordant with several genomic signatures indicative of immune-inflamed tumor microenvironment. Prevalence of activated immune-inflamed tumors across all tumor types was explored and used to rank tumor types for potential response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. RESULTS: The analysis yielded 3 tiers of indications in which high levels of PD-L1 and immune-inflamed signatures were found in up to 40% to 60%, 20% to 40%, and 0% to 20% of tumors. Tier 1 contained novel indications known at the time of analysis to be responsive to PD-1 checkpoint blockade in the clinic (such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer), as well as indications not studied in the clinic previously, including microsatellite instability-high colorectal, head and neck, bladder, and triple-negative breast cancers. Complementary analysis of an Asian/Pacific cancer dataset (gastric cancer) revealed high prevalence of immune-inflamed tumors in gastric cancer. These data contributed to prioritization of these indications for clinical development of pembrolizumab as monotherapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TMB scores were determined retrospectively for 72 consecutive patients at our institution with next-generation sequencing comprehensive genomic profiling testing by Foundation Medicine. TMB scores were correlated with a number of clinical variables and presence of DNA repair mutations. Thirty-four patients were treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapies, and survival analyses based on TMB score were performed. In addition, tissue immunohistochemical analysis was performed for a subset of patients. RESULTS: History of smoking, but not other clinical variables, including prior treatment lines, stage of disease, and number of metastatic sites, predicted higher TMB score. Higher TMB score was significantly associated with greater number of DNA repair mutations. In the subset of patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade, higher TMB score significantly predicted overall survival, but not progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 0.10, P = .003; hazard ratio 1.1, P = .84, respectively). In a small subset of patients, PD-1/PD-L1 staining did not independently predict progression-free survival or overall survival.

Notably, the recent intervention through immune checkpoint inhibitors has resulted in significant clinical responses and prolongation of survival in patients with several therapy-resistant cancers (melanoma, lung, bladder, etc.). This intervention was mediated by various antibodies directed against inhibitory receptors expressed on cytotoxic T-cells or against corresponding ligands expressed on tumor cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the clinical responses were only observed in a subset of the treated patients; it was not clear why the remaining patients did not respond to checkpoint inhibitor therapies. One hypothesis stated that the levels of PD-L1 expression correlated with poor clinical responses to cell-mediated anti-tumor immunotherapy. Hence, exploring the underlying mechanisms that regulate PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is one approach to target such mechanisms to reduce PD-L1 expression and, therefore, sensitize the resistant tumor cells to respond to PD-1/PD-L1 antibody treatments. Various investigations revealed that the overexpression of the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in most cancers is involved in the regulation of tumor cells resistance to cell-mediated immunotherapies. We, therefore, hypothesized that the role of YY1 in cancer immune resistance may be correlated with PD-L1 overexpression on cancer cells. This hypothesis was investigated and analysis of the reported literature revealed that several signaling crosstalk pathways exist between the regulations of both YY1 and PD-L1 expressions. Such pathways include p53, miR34a, STAT3, NF-kB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, c-Myc, and COX-2. Noteworthy, many clinical and pre-clinical drugs have been utilized to target these above pathways in various cancers independent of their roles in the regulation of PD-L1 expression. Therefore, the direct inhibition of YY1 and/or the use of the above targeted drugs in combination with checkpoint inhibitors should result in enhancing the cell-mediated anti-tumor cell response and also reverse the resistance observed with the use of checkpoint inhibitors alone."

We have attempted to establish whether the incidence of irAEs after the use of anti-PD-1 antibodies nivolumab or pembrolizumab in advanced malignancies is associated with anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied patients treated with single-agent nivolumab or pembrolizumab for advanced cancer. irAEs (immune-related adverse events) were identified clinically and graded as per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Efficacy was evaluated with objective response rate (ORR, immune-Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] criteria) progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Tests were performed to determine the association between irAEs and ORR, PFS or OS. RESULTS: We identified 106 patients. Primary diagnoses were lung cancer (n = 77), melanoma (n = 8), head and neck carcinoma (n = 7), renal carcinoma (n = 5), Hodgkins lymphoma (n = 3), urothelial carcinoma (n = 3) and gallbladder adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and Merkel cell carcinoma (n = 1 each). IrAEs were observed in 40 patients (37.7%). The most frequent irAEs were hypothyroidism (n = 15), nephritis (n = 5) and hyperthyroidism (n = 4). Objective response was observed in 44 patients (41.5%), and median PFS was 5.5 months (0.5-31 months). Thirty-three of the 40 patients with irAEs had objective response (82.5%) in contrast with 11 of the 66 cases without irAEs (16.6%) (OR 23.5, P < 0.000001). PFS in patients with irAEs was 10 months and 3 months in those without irAEs (HR 2.2, P = 0.016). OS in patients with irAEs was 32 months and 22 in those without irAEs, without statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: In advanced cancer treated with single-agent anti-PD-1 antibodies, patients with irAEs showed a markedly improved efficacy over patients without irAEs (ORR of 82.5% and PFS of 10 months vs ORR of 16.6% and PFS of 3 months).

Recent studies have revealed a significant role of programed cell death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) in negatively controlling the production of CD4+ T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines and airway hypersensitiveness, suggesting hypo-responsive Th2 cells via the PD-1/PD-L2 inhibitory pathway in lung could be reawaken by PD-1 blockade therapy. METHODS: We describe the first report of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), which is known as Th2-associated pulmonary disease, triggered by nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in an advanced non-small cell lung cancer patient. Based on the current case report and literature, the present study proposes a potential mechanism of the onset of AEP as an immune-related adverse event (irAE). RESULTS: A 62-year-old man was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and nivolumab was selected as the third-line regimen. After three cycles of nivolumab treatment, chest computed tomography revealed pulmonary infiltrates in both lungs. The patient was diagnosed with AEP based on the diagnostic criteria for AEP. Nivolumab was suspended and the patient was started on oral prednisolone. His symptoms and radiological findings had rapidly improved. CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing frequency of the use of anti-PD-1 antibodies, clinicians should be aware of the risk of AEP as a potential irAE. This study may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying Th2-associated irAEs and AEP.© 2018 The Authors. Immunity, Inflammation and DiseasePublished by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In two independent cohorts, we assessed the levels of 88 different soluble immune mediators in peripheral blood before and after anti-PD-1 treatment, and evaluated their associations with clinical outcomes. In the training cohort, the plasma levels of chitinase 3-like-1 and GM-CSF before treatment (p = 0.006 and p = 0.005, respectively) and changes in the plasma levels of CXCL2, VEGF, IFNα2, and MMP2 after treatment (p < 0.001, p = 0.019, p = 0.019, and p = 0.012, respectively) were significantly correlated with PFS. The change in the plasma CXCL2 level was also significantly associated with treatment-related AEs (p = 0.017). In the validation cohort, however, only the changes in the plasma levels of CXCL2 and MMP2 after treatment were associated with PFS (p = 0.003 and p = 0.006, respectively), and these changes were maintained during the course of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients who showed better clinical outcomes, even in those with tumor pseudoprogression.

We present a 62-year-old Caucasian male with recurrent lung adenocarcinoma and currently under third-line therapy with nivolumab, who was admitted in our hospital with abdominal distension. Radiologic findings were consistent with small bowel ileus. After four days of conservative treatment, the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy where no cause of ileus was discovered. Postoperative the ileus persisted and considering that an adverse effect of the immune checkpoint inhibition therapy occurred, the patient received high-dose prednisone resulting in gradual improvement of symptoms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors may induce adverse effects to unaffected organ systems and tissues including the skin, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, and endocrine system. The mainstay treatment consists of immunosuppression with corticosteroids in the majority of cases. As the clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitors is expanding rapidly, there is an emergence of unique immune-related adverse effects in a growing patient population. Gaining early awareness is essential in these patients in order to ensure prompt diagnosis and management."

However, primary/acquired resistance hampers its efficacy. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to improve checkpoint blockade therapy. Here we tested whether dual inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by flavonoid melafolone improves program death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade therapy through normalizing tumor vasculature and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) downregulation. Virtual screening assay, cellular thermal shift assay, and enzyme inhibition assay identified melafolone as a potential inhibitor of COX-2 and EGFR. In Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and CMT167 models, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR by melafolone promoted survival, tumor growth inhibition, and vascular normalization, and ameliorated CD8+ T-cell suppression, accompanied by the downregulation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and PD-L1 in the tumor cells. Mechanistically, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR in lung cancer cells by melafolone increased the migration of pericyte, decreased the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and enhanced the proliferation and effector function of CD8+ T cells through VEGF, TGF-β, or PD-L1 downregulation and PI3K/AKT inactivation. Notably, melafolone improved PD-1 immunotherapy against LLC and CMT167 tumors. Together, dual inhibition of COX-2 and EGFR by melafolone improves checkpoint blockade therapy through vascular normalization and PD-L1 downregulation and, by affecting vessels and immune cells, may be a promising combination strategy for the treatment of human lung cancer."

However, its radiological evaluation is challenging because of atypical patterns of response such as pseudoprogression. We examined the characteristics and outcomes of previously treated patients with NSCLC who were treated with nivolumab and experienced development of pseudoprogression. METHODS: We conducted a 15-center retrospective cohort study of previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC who received nivolumab monotherapy. For the patients who showed pseudoprogression, we defined progression-free survival 1 (PFS1) as the time to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined first progressive disease and progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) as the time to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined second progressive disease or death. RESULTS: Among the 542 patients included, 20% and 53% showed a typical response and progression, respectively. Of the 14 (3%) patients who showed pseudoprogression, most (n = 10) showed a response within 3 months of nivolumab treatment. The median PFS1 and PFS2 were 1.0 and 7.3 months, respectively. The median PFS2 was significantly shorter in the patients who showed pseudoprogression than the PFS of the patients with a typical response (p < 0.001). In contrast, patients showing pseudoprogression had significantly longer overall survival than did patients showing typical progression (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pseudoprogression was uncommon, and the duration of response in patients who showed pseudoprogression was shorter than that in patients who showed a typical response. However, the survival benefit of pseudoprogression was markedly better than that of typical progression. Further research is required to elucidate the characteristics of and mechanisms underlying pseudoprogression."

Hypoxia-related genes are also important regulators of PD-L1, and the role of PD-L1 in NSCLC is still not clear. The objective of this study was to investigate PD-L1 expression and its correlation with hypoxic-inducible factor 1α (HIF1A), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX) expression in NSCLC patients. The association between PD-L1 expression and survival was also determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PD-L1/protein expression was evaluated in 295 resected NSCLCs and its correlation with HIF1A, VEGFA, GLUT1, CAIX expression and survival was determined based on immunohistochemical and RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. RESULTS: PD-L1 protein expression was significantly correlated with HIF1A, VEGFA, GLUT1, and CAIX expression only in adenocarcinoma when a 10% or a 50% cut-off was used. PD-L1 mRNA expression was also significantly correlated with HIF1A, VEGFA, GLUT1, and CAIX expression in adenocarcinoma. Univariate analysis revealed that HIF1A expression was associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS), and GLUT1 was associated with poor overall survival (OS) and RFS. GLUT1 was an independent prognostic factor for OS in multivariate analysis of immunohistochemical and TCGA data (p = 0.024 and 0.029, respectively). Patients with low expression of both PD-L1 and GLUT1 had longer OS than other patterns in immunohistochemical and TCGA data (p = 0.003 and 0.051, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 protein and mRNA expression were correlated with HIF1A, VEGFA, GLUT1, and CAIX expression in adenocarcinoma alone. Low expression of GLUT1 and low expression of both PD-L1 and GLUT1 were associated with improved prognosis. Our findings support the rationale for co-targeting hypoxia-related genes and PD-L1 in cancer therapy. Expression of hypoxia-related genes may be helpful in selecting patients appropriate for PD-L1 therapy."

Serum IL-6 and TNF-α were measured in 10 non-small cell lung cancer patients who were evaluable within the 7 days before and after commencement of PD1-I. For CRP, medical records were reviewed and 34 patients with measured CRP within the 7 days before and after the treatment were evaluated. In the 10 patients analyzed for IL-6/TNF-α, the serum levels of IL-6/TNF-α were not significantly different between pre- and post-initial PD1-I [IL-6 20.3 (2.6-49.9) and 22.9 (3.6-96.1) pg/mL, p = 0.453; TNF-α 1.6 (0.7-6.3) and 3.3 (0.7-9.6) pg/mL, p = 0.329]; however, all four responses were observed among the 7 IL-6-elevated cases, resulting in a response rate of 57%. In the 34 patients analyzed for CRP, CRP was significantly increased after initial PD1-I [1.8 (0.1-17.8) mg/dL, 2.4 (0.0-27.8), p = 0.001]. Notably, in the 31 evaluable cases, all responses were again observed in either the IL-6 or CRP elevated groups and the response rate was 46% (11 of 24). The median overall survival time was not reached in the elevated group and was 112 days in the non-elevated group (p = 0.069). The early increase in inflammatory cytokines with PD1-I was indicated to be predictive for the efficacy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer."

Thirty-eight pretreatment and two post-treatment specimens from 36 advanced, treatment-refractory non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent PD-1 blockade therapy were analyzed. PD-L1 expression by tumor cells and the distribution of CD3, CD8, CD4, FOXP3 and PD-1 positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were immunohistochemically assessed and counted using digital image analyzer. CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were distributed more in PD-L1 positive group compared to PD-L1 negative group. Conversely, EGFR mutant group showed fewer CD3+ T cells than EGFR-naïve group. The patients in the clinical benefit group with PD-1 blockade showed a higher number of CD3+, CD8+ T cells and a higher CD8+/CD3+ T cell ratio (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, and p = 0.042) and a lower FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio compared to non-responders (p = 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, increased CD3+ T cell infiltration and low FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio were found to be independent predictors of clinical benefit with PD-1 blockade (p = 0.014 and p = 0.03, respectively). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, levels of CD3+ T cells and FOXP3+/CD8+ T cell ratio that provide the best distinguishing point between responder versus non-responder to PD-1 blockade were 617.5/mm2 and 25%, respectively (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003). Considering that 1 mm2 is about 5 high power fields (HPF), a good response to the PD-1 blockade can be expected when the number of CD3 T cells is observed to be 120 per HPF and when CD8+ T cells and FOXP3+ T cells are present at a ratio greater than 4:1. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes might become a promising biomarker as an independent predictive factor of response to PD-1 blockade that may also guide therapeutic decisions."

Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) is a coinhibitory receptor associated with impaired T-cell function and is frequently coexpressed with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) in the context of human cancers. Targeting LAG-3 in conjunction with PD-1 thus represents a strategy to amplify and broaden the therapeutic impact of PD-1 blockade alone. We have generated a high affinity and selective humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody, TSR-033, which binds human LAG-3 and serves as a functional antagonist, enhancing in vitro T-cell activation both in mixed lymphocyte reactions and staphylococcal enterotoxin B-driven stimulation assays. In a humanized mouse non-small cell lung carcinoma model, TSR-033 boosted the antitumor efficacy of PD-1 monotherapy, with a concomitant increase in immune activation. Analogous studies in a murine syngeneic tumor model using surrogate antibodies demonstrated significant synergy between LAG-3 and PD-1 blockade-combination treatment led to a marked improvement in therapeutic efficacy, increased T-cell proliferation, IFNγ production, and elicited durable immunologic memory upon tumor rechallenge. Taken together, the pharmacologic activity of TSR-033 demonstrates that it is a potent anti-LAG-3 therapeutic antibody and supports its clinical investigation in cancer patients.  ©2018 American Association for Cancer Research."

In the present study, checkpoint proteins and ligands, including programmed death-1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), cluster of differentiation (CD)155 and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) were systematically analyzed in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Furthermore their clinicopathological features and survival rates were investigated. Immunohistochemistry was performed in order to analyze the expression of PD-L1, CD155, PD-1 and TIGIT in 60 patients with SCLC, and survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. It was reported that CD155/TIGIT and PD-L1/PD-1 were highly expressed on tissues of surgically resected SCLC. High expression levels of PD-L1, CD155 or PD-L1+CD155 were significantly associated with shorter survival. However, high expression levels of PD-1 or TIGIT exhibited no obvious association with shorter survival time. Moreover, patients with SCLC in whom PD-L1 and CD155 levels were highly expressed had the shortest survival rate. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that highly expressed PD-L1 [hazard ratio (HR)=2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.18-5.51, P=0.017] and CD155 (HR=2.40, 95% CI=1.05-5.50, P=0.038) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) time in SCLC. In addition, it was reported that TIGIT and PD-1, the receptors of CD155 and PD-L1, respectively, were also constitutively expressed on CD8+ TILs and tumor cells in SCLC. High expression levels of PD-L1 and CD155 were independent prognostic factors for OS time in patients with SCLC."

We investigated the effects of these two therapies, combined, in the lung tissue of an orthotopic tumor-bearing mouse model. The mice received an 8 Gy dose three times with or without 200 µg anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibody intraperitoneal injection every three days. Lung tissues were H&E stained to determine histological changes. The serum levels of cytokines, such as interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-5, were detected by cytometric bead array. The neutrophil infiltration was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for myeloperoxidase. The lung injury score was higher in the treated groups than the control group, especially in the combined treatment group, in which the proportion of neutrophils in lung tissues was significantly higher compared to any other groups. Similarly, the CD4/CD8 ratio of the lung tissues in the combined treatment group, as well as the serum levels of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-5, were significantly higher than the other groups. These findings indicate that radiation combined with anti-PD-1 treatment leads to more severe lung injury in the orthotopic tumor-bearing mouse model, accompanied by increased neutrophil infiltration and increased inflammatory response."

However, whether TMB estimated by circulating tumor DNA in blood (bTMB) is associated with clinical outcomes of immunotherapy remains to be explored. Objectives: To explore the optimal gene panel size and algorithm to design a CGP for TMB estimation, evaluate the panel reliability, and further validate the feasibility of bTMB as a clinical actionable biomarker for immunotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, a CGP named NCC-GP150 was designed and virtually validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas database. The correlation between bTMB estimated by NCC-GP150 and tissue TMB (tTMB) measured by WES was evaluated in matched blood and tissue samples from 48 patients with advanced NSCLC. An independent cohort of 50 patients with advanced NSCLC was used to identify the utility of bTMB estimated by NCC-GP150 in distinguishing patients who would benefit from anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) therapy. The study was performed from July 19, 2016, to April 20, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Assessment of the Spearman correlation coefficient between bTMB estimated by NCC-GP150 and tTMB calculated by WES. Evaluation of the association of bTMB level with progression-free survival and response to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapy. Results: This study used 2 independent cohorts of patients with NSCLC (cohort 1: 48 patients; mean [SD] age, 60 [13] years; 15 [31.2%] female; cohort 2: 50 patients; mean [SD] age, 58 [8] years; 15 [30.0%] female). A CGP, including 150 genes, demonstrated stable correlations with WES for TMB estimation (median r2 = 0.91; interquartile range, 0.89-0.92), especially when synonymous mutations were included (median r2 = 0.92; interquartile range, 0.91-0.93), whereas TMB estimated by the NCC-GP150 panel found higher correlations with TMB estimated by WES than most of the randomly sampled 150-gene panels. Blood TMB estimated by NCC-GP150 correlated well with the matched tTMB calculated by WES (Spearman correlation = 0.62). In the anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 treatment cohort, a bTMB of 6 or higher was associated with superior progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.84; log-rank P = .01) and objective response rates (bTMB ≥6: 39.3%; 95% CI, 23.9%-56.5%; bTMB <6: 9.1%; 95% CI, 1.6%-25.9%; P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that established NCC-GP150 with an optimized gene panel size and algorithm is feasible for bTMB estimation, which may serve as a potential biomarker of clinical benefit in patients with NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents."

Analysis is commonly done on small tissue biopsy samples representing a minimal fraction of the whole tumor. The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation of PD-L1 expression on biopsy specimens with corresponding resection specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 58 consecutive cases with preoperative biopsy and resected tumor specimens were selected. From each resection specimen 2 tumor cores were compiled into a tissue microarray (TMA). Immunohistochemical staining with the antibody SP263 was performed on biopsy specimens, resection specimens (whole sections), as well as on the TMA. RESULTS: The proportion of PD-L1-positive stainings were comparable between the resection specimens (48% and 19%), the biopsies (43% and 17%), and the TMAs (47% and 14%), using cutoffs of 1% and 50%, respectively (P > .39 all comparisons). When the resection specimens were considered as reference, PD-L1 status differed in 16%/5% for biopsies and in 9%/9% for TMAs (1%/50% cutoff). The sensitivity of the biopsy analysis was 79%/82% and the specificity was 90%/98% at the 1%/50% cutoff. The Cohens κ value for the agreement between biopsy and tumor. was 0.70 at the 1% cutoff and 0.83 at the 50% cutoff. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a moderate concordance between the analysis of biopsy and whole tumor tissue, resulting in misclassification of samples in particular when the lower 1% cutoff was used. Clinicians should be aware of this uncertainty when interpreting PD-L1 reports for treatment decisions."

Targeted therapy approaches are promising treatments for lung cancer. However, despite the development of targeted therapies using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as well as monoclonal antibodies, the five-year relative survival rate for lung cancer patients is still only 18%, and patients inevitably become resistant to therapy. Mutations in Kirsten ras sarcoma viral homolog (KRAS) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the two most common genetic events in lung adenocarcinoma; they account for 25% and 20% of cases, respectively. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, and ALK rearrangements are responsible for 3-7% of NSCLC, predominantly of the adenocarcinoma subtype, and occur in a mutually exclusive manner with KRAS and EGFR mutations. Among drug-resistant NSCLC patients, nearly half exhibit the T790M mutation in exon 20 of EGFR. This review focuses on some basic aspects of molecules involved in NSCLC, the development of resistance to treatments in NSCLC, and advances in lung cancer therapy in the past ten years.

Treatment stratification depends on immunohistochemical PD-L1 measurement of biopsy material, an invasive method that does not account for spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Using a single domain antibody (sdAb), NM-01, against PD-L1, radiolabeled site-specifically with technetium-99m (99mTc) for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, we aimed to assess the safety, radiation dosimetry and imaging characteristics of this radiopharmaceutical and correlate tumor uptake with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry results. Methods: Sixteen patients (mean age 61.7 years, 11 male) with NSCLC were recruited. Primary tumor PD-L1 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry. NM-01 was radiolabeled with [99mTc(OH2)3(CO)3]+ complex binding to its C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Administered activity was 3.8-10.4 MBq/kg, corresponding to 100 µg or 400 µg of NM-01. Whole body planar and thoracic SPECT/CT scans were performed at 1 and 2h post-injection in all patients and 5 patients had additional imaging at 10mins, 3 and 24h for radiation dosimetry calculations. All patients were monitored for adverse events. Results: No drug-related adverse events occurred in this study. The mean effective dose was 8.84×10-3 ± 9.33×10-4 mSv/MBq (3.59 ± 0.74 mSv per patient). Tracer uptake was observed in the kidneys, spleen, liver and bone marrow. SPECT primary tumor-blood pool ratios (T:BP) varied from 1.24 to 2.3 (mean = 1.79) at 1h and 1.24 to 3.53 (mean = 2.22) at 2h (P = 0.005). 2h primary T:BP ratios correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry results (r=0.68, P = 0.014). 2h T:BP was lower in tumors with ≤1% PD-L1 expression (1.89 vs 2.49, P = 0.048). Nodal and bone metastases showed tracer uptake. Heterogeneity (>20%) between primary tumor and nodal T:BP was present in 4 of 12 patients. Conclusion: This first in human study demonstrates that 99mTc-labeled anti-PD-L1-sdAb SPECT/CT imaging is safe and associated with acceptable dosimetry.

METHODS: Patients with NSCLC, treated with anti-PD-1 agents, were retrospectively evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between types of irAEs (differentiated according to system/organ involved and to single-site/multiple-site), overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We further performed a 6-week landmark analysis. RESULTS: A total of 559 patients were enrolled; 231 patients (41.3%) developed irAEs of any grade and 50 patients (8.9%) G3/G4 events; 191 of them (82.6%) developed single-site irAEs and 40 (17.4%) multiple-site irAEs. At multivariate analysis, higher ORR was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), single-site irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine (P = .0043) and skin irAEs (P = .0005). Longer PFS was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), single-site irAEs (P < .0001), multiple-site irAEs (P = .0374), endocrine irAEs (P = .0084) and skin irAEs (P = .0001). Longer OS was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), single-site irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine irAEs (P = .0044), gastrointestinal irAEs (P = .0437), skin irAEs (P = .0006), and others irAEs (P = .0378). At the 6-week landmark analysis, irAEs of any grade was confirmed an independent predictor of higher ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that irAEs are concordantly related to higher ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC."

This review discusses the evolution of pegylated IL-10 (pegilodecakin) from preclinical investigation through first-in-human studies in oncology. RECENT FINDINGS: Pegilodecakin was evaluated across multiple advanced solid tumors in a large phase 1/1b trial alone and in combination with chemotherapy or anti-PD-1 antibodies. Pegilodecakin monotherapy had immunologic and clinical activity in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and uveal melanoma. In combination with anti-PD-1 inhibitors, pegilodecakin increased the responses in RCC and lung cancer with efficacy agnostic to PD-L1 status and tumor mutational burden. Pegilodecakin with FOLFOX had activity in pretreated pancreatic cancer, instructing the ongoing randomized phase III trial of the combination versus FOLFOX. The increased half-life of pegilodecakin enabled compelling preclinical data for IL-10 which has now been confirmed by clinical activity in a variety of cancers. The ability of pegilodecakin to both exert anti-tumor immunity and inhibit tumor-associated inflammation characterizes the uniqueness of this cytokine therapy."

Although recent advances have been made in management including incorporation of antiangiogenic, anti-EGFR, and anti-HER2 directed therapies, overall their prognosis remains poor. Anti-PD-1 therapy with nivolumab and pembrolizumab are licensed for advanced chemorefractory gastroesophageal cancer and many other checkpoint inhibitor therapies are being assessed alone and in combination in these diseases. One of the challenges posed in assessing response to immunotherapy treatment is the phenomenon of pseudoprogression. This phenomenon, which is well described in patients with malignant melanoma is most frequently described as a size increase of contrast enhancing lesions or appearance of new lesions that stabilize or reduce in size with time. Most other solid tumors have a low incidence of pseudoprogression although cases have been reported for lung, head, and neck cancer and a range of gliomas. Herein we present 6 cases of patients with gastrointestinal cancers who were treated with anti-PD1 (programmed cell death) and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand-1) antibodies, and experience pseudoprogression."

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab between January 2016 and September 2018 for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on baseline computed tomography was assessed to calculate the psoas muscle index (PMI). Sarcopenia was defined based on PMI cut-off values for Asian adults (6.36 cm2/m2 for males and 3.92 cm2/m2 for females). A total of 42 patients were analysed. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 52.4%. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) (median, 2.1 vs. 6.8 months, p = 0.004). Compared to patients with sarcopenia, those without sarcopenia had a higher overall response rate (40.0% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.025) and 1-year PFS rate (38.1% vs. 10.1%). In conclusion, sarcopenia at baseline as determined using computed tomography is a significant predictor of worse outcome in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving PD-1 blockade. Screening for sarcopenia may help identify patients more likely to achieve a long-term response in routine clinical practice."

[Epub ahead of print]","Multiple sclerosis outcomes after cancer immunotherapy.","INTRODUCTION: Neurological immune-related adverse events are a rare but potentially deadly complication after immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. As multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease, it is unknown how ICI treatment may affect outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, avelumab, and durvalumab 2 years prior their FDA approval until December 31, 2017, to include all cases with confirmed diagnosis/relapse of MS. We also included cases reported in the literature and a patient from our institution. RESULTS: We identified 14 cases of MS with median age of presentation of 52 years. Indications for ICI included melanoma in 7 (36.36%) cases, non-small cell lung carcinoma in 2 (18.18%) cases, 1 case (9.09%) each of pleural mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, and colorectal cancer, and unreported in 2 (18.18%) cases. History of MS was confirmed in 8 (57.1%) cases. Median time to beginning of symptoms was 29 days with rapid disease progression; two patients died due to their relapse. Median time for symptom resolution was 8 weeks. Outcomes did not vary by comparing CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Reported MS relapses after ICI are rare, but the adverse events described include rapid neurologic progression and death. Larger and prospective studies are warranted to assess disability and long-term outcomes and outweigh the risks of starting immunotherapy in patients with MS."

Pembrolizumab, which targets PD-1, has been approved as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with positive PD-L1 expression. However, PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades have not achieved breakthroughs in treating glioblastoma because glioblastoma has a low immunogenic response and an immunosuppressive microenvironment caused by the precise crosstalk between cytokines and immune cells. A phase III clinical trial, Checkmate 143, reported that nivolumab, which targets PD-1, did not demonstrate survival benefits compared with bavacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma patients. Thus, the combination of a PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade with RT, TMZ, antibodies targeting other inhibitory or stimulatory molecules, targeted therapy, and vaccines may be an appealing solution aimed at achieving optimal clinical benefit. There are many ongoing clinical trials exploring the efficacy of various approaches based on PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades in primary or recurrent glioblastoma patients. Many challenges need to be overcome, including the identification of discrepancies between different genomic subtypes in their response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades, the selection of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades for primary versus recurrent glioblastoma, and the identification of the optimal combination and sequence of combination therapy. In this review, we describe the immunosuppressive molecular characteristics of the tumour microenvironment (TME), candidate biomarkers of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades, ongoing clinical trials and challenges of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockades in glioblastoma."

This is the first report on the efficacy of the nintedanib/docetaxel combination following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and subsequent immunotherapy in a real-world setting. METHODS/PATIENTS: From May 2014 to December 2015, 390 patients in 108 Spanish centres enrolled in the nintedanib named patient use program. Inclusion criteria were advanced lung adenocarcinoma with progressive disease following at least one line of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the nintedanib/docetaxel combination in patients who also received immunotherapy. RESULTS: Eleven patients met the inclusion criteria; with a median age of 67 years. PD-L1 expression was positive in six patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was 3.3 months (95% CI 1.9-4.6). Second-line immunotherapy was pembrolizumab (36.5%), atezolizumab (36.5%) or nivolumab (27%). Median PFS of second-line immunotherapy was 2.3 months (95% CI 0-6.1). The overall response rate (ORR) to second-line immunotherapy was 18% with a disease-control rate (DCR) of 45%. Median PFS of nintedanib/docetaxel was 3.2 months (95% CI 1.9-4.5). Best response was partial response in four patients (36%), stable disease in five patients (46%), and progressive disease in two patients (18%), for an ORR of 36% and a DCR of 82%. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests an encouraging efficacy of nintedanib/docetaxel in patients with adenocarcinoma NSCLC pretreated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and immunotherapy, reinforcing the importance of an optimal therapeutic sequence for managing advanced lung adenocarcinoma."

It is not known, however, if immunotherapy (IT) confers the same outcome advantage in lung cancer patients with brain metastases treated with SRS.METHODSThe authors retrospectively reviewed 85 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastases who were treated with SRS between January 2006 and December 2016. Thirty-nine PD-L1 antibody-positive patients received anti-PD-1 therapy with SRS (IT group) and 46 patients received chemotherapy (CT) with SRS (CT group). Results were obtained using chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, and Mann-Whitney U tests and Cox regression analyses.RESULTSMedian survival following first radiosurgical treatment in the whole study group was 11.6 months (95% CI 8-15.5 months). Median survival times in the IT group and CT group were 10 months (95% CI 8.3-13.2 months) and 11.6 months (95% CI 7.7-15.6 months), respectively (p = 0.23). A Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score < 80 (p = 0.001) and lung-specific molecular marker Graded Prognostic Assessment (lungmol GPA) score < 1.5 (p = 0.02) were found to be predictive of worse survival.Maximal percent lesional shrinkage and time to maximal shrinkage were not significantly different between the CT and IT groups. Of the lesions for which a complete response occurred, 94.8% had pre-SRS volumes < 500 mm3. The amount of lesion shrinkage and time to maximal shrinkage were not different between the IT and CT groups for lesions with volumes < 500 mm3. However, in lesions with volume > 500 mm3, 90% of lesions shrank after radiosurgery in the IT group compared with 47.8% in the CT group (p = 0.001). Median times to initial response and times to maximal shrinkage were faster in the IT group than in the CT group: initial response 49 days (95% CI 33.7-64.3 days) versus 84 days (95% CI 28.1-140 days), p = 0.001; maximal response 105 days (95% CI 59-150 days) versus 182 days (95% CI 119.6-244 days), p = 0.12.CONCLUSIONSUnlike patients with melanoma, patients with NSCLC with brain metastases undergoing SRS showed no significant benefit-either in terms of survival or total amount of lesional response-when anti-PD-1 therapies were used. However, in lesions with volume > 500 mm3, combining SRS with IT may result in a faster and better volumetric response which may be particularly beneficial in lesions causing mass effect or located in neurologically critical locations."

Targeting of KLRG1 neutralization in murine cancer models has not previously been reported. Methods: We studied KLRG1 expression in human blood and tumor samples from available genomic datasets. Anti-KLRG1 neutralizing antibody was studied in the murine 4T1 breast cancer as monotherapy, and in the MC38 colon cancer and B16F10 melanoma models as combination therapy with anti-PD-1 antibody. Results: In human blood and tumor samples, KLRG1 expression is aligned with cytotoxic T and NK cell differentiation, and upregulated in human tumor samples after a variety of therapies, potentially contributing to adaptive resistance. In in vivo murine models, anti-KLRG1 antibody monotherapy in the 4T1 breast cancer model reduced lung metastases (decreased lung weights p=0.04; decreased nodule count p=0.002), while anti-KLRG1 + anti-PD-1 combination therapy in the MC38 colon cancer and B16F10 melanoma models produced synergistic benefit greater than anti-PD-1 alone for tumor volume (MC38 p=0.01; B16F10 p=0.007) and survival (MC38 p=0.02; B16F10 p=0.002). Conclusions: These studies provide the first evidence that inhibition of the KLRG1 pathway enhances immune control of cancer in murine models, and provide target validation for KLRG1 targeting of human cancer. The mechanism of efficacy of KLRG1 blockade in murine models remains to be determined."

Elevated levels of PD-L1 expression were observed on NSCLC cells. The association between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features is still unclear. Therefore, we examined this relationship and also compare PD-L1 expression levels with Ki-67, p63 and TTF-1. METHODS: 866 samples of NSCLCs were used to prepare tissue microarrays (TMAs) on which immunohistochemical (IHC) reactions were performed. Changes in the level of CD274 (PD-L1) gene expression in 62 NSCLC tumors were tested in relation to 14 normal lung tissues by real-time PCR reactions (RT-PCR). RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was observed in 32.6% of NSCLCs. PD-L1 expression was increased in higher malignancy grades (G) (p < 0.0001) and in higher lymph node status (pN) (p = 0.0428). The patients with low PD-L1 expression had longer overall survival compared to the group with high expression (p = 0.0332) in adenocarcinoma (AC) only. CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 expression seems to be associated with increased tumor proliferation and aggressiveness as well as shorter patient survival in NSCLC, predominantly in the AC group."

Tumor PD-L1 expression is used for stratification of non-small cell lung (NSCLC) patients, with tumor mutational burden (TMB) also being explored with promising results, and mismatch-repair deficiency is approved for tumor site-agnostic disease. While tumors with high PD-L1 expression, high TMB, or mismatch repair deficiency respond well to checkpoint blockade, tumors with lower PD-L1 expression, lower mutational burdens, or mismatch repair proficiency respond much less frequently. CASE PRESENTATION: We studied two patients with unexpected responses to checkpoint blockade monotherapy: a patient with PD-L1-negative and low mutational burden NSCLC and one with mismatch repair proficient colorectal cancer (CRC), both of whom lack the biomarkers associated with response to checkpoint blockade, yet achieved durable clinical benefit. Both maintained T-cell responses in peripheral blood to oncogenic driver mutations - BRAF-N581I in the NSCLC and AKT1-E17K in the CRC - years after treatment initiation. Mutation-specific T cells were also found in the primary tumor and underwent dynamic perturbations in the periphery upon treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that T cell responses to oncogenic driver mutations may be more prevalent than previously appreciated and could be harnessed in immunotherapeutic treatment, particularly for patients who lack the traditional biomarkers associated with response. Comprehensive studies are warranted to further delineate additional predictive biomarkers and populations of patients who may benefit from checkpoint blockade."

Cancer is the leading cause of death among non-AIDS-defining illnesses in these patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has transformed the treatment of cancer. However, clinical trials of ICIs have historically excluded patients with HIV infection. The safety and efficacy profile of ICIs is unknown in this underrepresented population. Objective: To summarize results on the safety and efficacy of ICI therapy in HIV-infected patients with advanced-stage cancer. Evidence Review: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A literature search of PubMed was performed on April 16, 2018, using the keyword HIV and the names of ICIs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, avelumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab). Patients with HIV infection who were being treated with ICIs for advanced-stage cancer were included. In addition, abstracts and posters from major oncology and AIDS society annual meetings from 2016 through 2018 were reviewed. Findings: Seventy-three patients (66 [90.4%] male; mean age, 56.1 years [ range, 30.0-77.0 years]) were identified from 13 articles (11 case reports and 2 case series) and 4 meeting abstracts. Sixty-two patients were treated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy, 6 with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA-4) therapy, 4 with anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy, and 1 with sequential ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy was generally well tolerated, with grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events noted in 6 of 70 patients (8.6%). Among 34 patients with known paired pretreatment and posttreatment HIV loads, HIV remained suppressed in 26 of the 28 (93%) with undetectable HIV load. Among the 25 with paired pretreatment and posttreatment CD4 cell counts, the counts increased (mean [SD] change, 12.3 [28.5] /μL). Objective response rates were 30% for non-small cell lung cancer, 27% for melanoma, and 63% for Kaposi sarcoma. Conclusions and Relevance: Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for the treatment of advanced-stage cancer in patients with HIV infection was associated with no new safety signals. Immune checkpoint inhibitors may be a safe and efficacious treatment option in this patient population. Several ongoing prospective clinical trials will shed further light on the safety and efficacy of ICI therapy in HIV-infected patients with cancer."

In this study, we investigated the clinical outcomes of patients treated with sequential immunotherapy. Methods We performed a retrospective review of 90 advanced stage cancer patients treated on immunotherapy-based phase 1 clinical trials at Winship Cancer Institute from 2009 to 2017. We included 49 patients with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-indicated histology. Patients were analyzed based on whether they had received prior ICI. Clinical outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and clinical benefit (best response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease). Univariate analysis (UVA) and multivariate analysis (MVA) were performed using Cox proportional hazard or logistic regression model. Covariates included age, liver metastases, number of prior lines of therapy, histology, and Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) risk group. Results The most common histologies were melanoma (61%) and lung/head and neck cancers (37%). More than half of patients (n = 27, 55%) received at least one ICI prior to trial enrollment: ten received anti-PD-1, two received anti-CTLA-4, five received anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination, and ten received multiple ICI. In MVA, ICI-naïve patients had significantly longer OS (HR: 0.22, CI: 0.07-0.70, p = 0.010) and trended towards higher chance of CB (HR: 2.52, CI: 0.49-12.97, p = 0.268). Patients who received prior ICI had substantially shorter median OS (10.9 vs 24.3 months, p = 0.046) and PFS (2.8 vs. 5.1 months, p = 0.380) than ICI-naïve patients per Kaplan-Meier estimation. Within the ICI-naïve group, 78% (7 of 9) of patients who received prior interleukin (IL-2) or interferon gamma (IFNγ) experienced disease control for at least 6 months, compared to a disease control rate of 15% (2 of 13) in patients who had received chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or no prior treatment. Conclusions ICI-naïve patients may experience improved clinical outcomes on immunotherapy-based phase 1 clinical trials than patients who have received prior ICI. This may be particularly true for patients who received prior IL-2 or IFNγ. Further development of immunotherapy combination therapies is needed to improve clinical outcomes of these patients. These results should be validated in a larger study."

[Epub ahead of print]","EGFR-targeted therapy alters the tumor microenvironment in EGFR-driven lung tumors: Implications for combination therapies.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death receptor/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway have profoundly improved the clinical management of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, the superiority of single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in pretreated EGFR mutant patients has turned out to be moderate. One proposed mechanism for poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors is an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we utilized two autochthonous EGFR-driven lung tumor models to investigate dynamic microenvironmental responses to EGFR-TKI treatment. We observed that at an early stage, sensitive EGFR-TKIs caused obvious tumor shrinkage accompanied by increased cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells, eradication of Foxp3+ Tregs, and inhibition of M2-like polarization of macrophages. However, the tumor microenvironmental changes that may be most beneficial for combination treatment with immune-mediated anticancer approaches were only temporary and disappeared as treatment continued. Meanwhile, the level of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), particularly mononuclear MDSCs, was consistently elevated throughout the treatment. Analysis of inflammatory factors in serum showed that EGFR-TKIs increased the levels of IL-10 and CCL-2. Our study systematically analyzed dynamic changes in tumor microenvironments responding to EGFR-TKIs in vivo. The results have implications for combination therapy using EGFR-TKIs.

Histologically it is characterized by small cells with scant cytoplasm, absent or inconspicuous nucleoli, extensive necrosis, and expresses neuroendocrine markers. It is on a spectrum of neuroendocrine cancer that extend from typical carcinoids to large cell to small cell cancer. Clinically it behaves in a more malignant fashion with a rapid doubling time, early metastasis. They respond rapidly to cytotoxic treatment however tend to develop resistance soon. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors take advantage of PD 1 ligand-receptor axis between the tumor and T cells or CTLA4 on T cells which when engaged lead to inhibition of T cells. This inhibition helps tumors to evade immune surveillance. Checkpoint inhibitors break this axis by either binding to PD 1 ligands or PD 1 to CTLA4, thereby preventing tumors to evade the immune systems. This has led to remarkable responses in tumors. The immune related adverse effects can be severe however are experienced at much lower rates as compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Recently, CheckMate 032 has shown impressive response rates with Nivolumab and Nivolumab/Ipilimumab in relapsed small cell cancer. IMpower 133, a phase 3 trial showed that addition of Atezolizumab to Carbo/Etoposide led to a significant survival benefit in treatment naive extensive small cell cancer. This review will summarize recent developments and ongoing studies of immune therapy in extensive small cell cancer in addition to a brief summary of immune therapy landscape of Non small cell lung cancer. Investigational approaches to immune therapy have also been delineated."

Also, the control of particle size and drug release of a drug carrier for multidrug combination is a key issue influencing the therapy effect. Here, a cocktail strategy is reported, in which chemotherapy against both bulk tumor cells and CSC and immune checkpoint blockade therapy are intergraded into one drug delivery system. The chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (PTX), the anti-CSC agent thioridazine (THZ), and the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor HY19991 (HY) are all incorporated into an enzyme/pH dual-sensitive nanoparticle with a micelle-liposome double-layer structure. The particle size shrinks when the nanoparticle transfers from circulation to tumor tissues, favoring both pharmacokinetics and cellular uptake, meanwhile achieving sequential drug release where needed. This nano device, named PM@THL, increases the intratumoral drug concentrations in mice and exhibits significant anticancer efficacy, with tumor inhibiting rate of 93.45% and lung metastasis suppression rate of 97.64%. It also reduces the proportion of CSC and enhances the T cells infiltration in tumor tissues, and thus prolongs the survival of mice. The cocktail therapy based on the spatio-temporally controlled nano device will be a promising strategy for treating breast cancer.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim."

Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand-2 (PD-L2). Pembrolizumab was first approved by the FDA in 2014 for the treatment of advanced melanoma and is currently approved for use in non-small cell lung cancer and several other neoplasms. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have been reported to induce immune-mediated side effects, including type 1 diabetes mellitus in very rare cases (0.1% in clinical trials). Here, we report the case of a woman with no known history of diabetes who presented to our emergency department in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis within 3 weeks of receiving only a single dose of pembrolizumab therapy, and without any previous exposure to immunotherapy. This case of abrupt adult-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus is an example of the undesirable side effects that can emerge after only a brief exposure to an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Close monitoring of patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors is warranted for the early diagnosis and management of imminent and potentially life-threatening complications."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from patients who received ≥1 dose of single-agent PD1 inhibitor between August 3, 2011 and August 31, 2016 were obtained from our Institutions pharmacy database. AEs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-two patients received at least one dose of single-agent PD1 inhibitor prior to data cut-off. After excluding 14 patients with uncommon malignancies, the total number of patients were 168. The median age was 63 (range=24-92) years. There were 87 (52%) cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 35 (21%) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 12 (7%) of melanoma, 18 (11%) of Hodgkins lymphomas, eight (5%) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and eight (5%) of small cell lung cancer. Considering grade 2 or more AEs, 30 (18%) patients had kidney injury, 34 (20%) hypothyroidism, 36 (21%) transaminitis, 20 (12%) pneumonitis, and 18 (11%) colitis. Patients with RCC had higher odds of experiencing grade 2 or more kidney injury than patients with other primary tumor types (adjusted p=0.025), whereas patients with Hodgkins lymphoma and HNSCC had higher odds of grade 2 hypothyroidism (adjusted p=0.005). Patients with NSCLC had higher risk of death with pneumonitis than those whose primary cancer was not NSCLC (adjusted p=0.005). DISCUSSION: The increased odds of patients with Hodgkins lymphoma and HNSCC experiencing grade 2 or more hypothyroidism may be related to previous radiation exposure. Most patients with RCC had undergone nephrectomy, making them more susceptible to acute kidney injury. When pneumonitis occurred in patients with primary NSCLC, the overall survival was significantly worse. The duration of PD1 therapy was significantly associated with onset of pneumonitis (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: The site of primary tumor or metastasis may help predict the most common AEs in patients treated with PD1 inhibitors."

Relapse of hematologic malignancy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation limits the success of this approach, and PD-1 blockade may hold therapeutic promise. However, PD-1 expression and its relationship with post-transplant relapse is poorly described. Because the donor immunity is activated by alloresponses, PD-1 expression may differ from nontransplanted individuals, and PD-1 blockade could risk graft-versus-host disease. Here we analyzed T-cell exhaustion marker kinetics and their relationship with leukemia relapse in 85 patients undergoing myeloablative T-cell-depleted HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 35 (44%) patients relapsed. PD-1 expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells was comparably elevated in relapsed and nonrelapsed cohorts. Helios+ regulatory T cells and CD8 effector memory cells at day 30 emerged as independent predictors of relapse. Although leukemia antigen-specific T cells did not overexpress PD-1, single-cell analysis revealed LAG3 and TIM3 overexpression at relapse. These findings indicate that PD-1 is an unreliable marker for leukemia-specific T-cell exhaustion in relapsing patients but implies other exhaustion markers and suppressor cells as relapse biomarkers."

Immune response has long been a question of great interest in a wide range of fields such as cancer therapies and anti-tumor immunity through checkpoint inhibitors, specifically anti PD-1/ PD-L1 interaction, is a new line of research for treatment of CRC patients. Following the successful development of anti-PD-1 for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, several clinical trials have been conducted on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PD-1 in CRC. There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of anti-PD-1 therapy for MSI (Microsatellite instability) tumors among CRC subtypes. We present a comprehensive knowledge of immune therapy through PD-1/PD-L1 blockade that argues how efficient the process is, in colon cancer carcinoma. In this review, we discuss the responsiveness of immunotherapy on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and various tactics for overcoming weak responses to these checkpoint inhibitors in CRC. More research using controlled trials is required to enable new discoveries to provide continued success with immune-based therapies and grounds for optimism about the future of CRC patients."

We thus conducted this meta-analysis to compare the relative efficacy of nivolumab vs docetaxel-based chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through searches of databases and conference proceedings. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), drug responses, and adverse effects (AEs) were assessed as the primary endpoints. RESULTS: After screening, we included six studies (949 patients) in the final analysis. Nivolumab showed better efficacy in terms of the PFS (hazard ratios [HR]: 0.70, P = 0.03), OS (HR: 0.70, P < 0.00001), objective response rate (ORR) (risk ratios [RR]: 1.73, P = 0.0008), total AEs (RR: 0.77, P = 0.006), and grade 3-5 AEs (RR: 0.18, P < 0.00001) than docetaxel. The anti-tumor efficacy of nivolumab for NSCLC in terms of both PFS and OS was positively correlated with the level of PD-L1 expression. In the nivolumab treatment arm, the 10 most-reported AEs were fatigue (15.7%), nausea (10.8%), decreased appetite (10.3%), asthenia (9.8%), diarrhea (7.5%), rash (7.5%), arthralgia (5.4%), vomiting (4.4%), constipation (3.5%), and pyrexia (3.3%). CONCLUSIONS: For advanced NSCLC, nivolumab is a better therapy in terms of both anti-tumor efficacy and safety than docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

Neither clinicopathologic features nor biological mechanisms associated with HP have been identified. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Among 187 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICI at our institute, cases with HP were identified according to clinical and radiologic criteria. Baseline histologic samples from patients treated with ICI were evaluated by IHC for myeloid and lymphoid markers. T-cell-deficient mice, injected with human lung cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) belonging to specific mutational subsets, were assessed for tumor growth after treatment with antibodies against mouse and human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). The immune microenvironment was evaluated by flow cytometry and IHC. RESULTS: Among 187 patients, 152 were evaluable for clinical response. We identified four categories: 32 cases were defined as responders (21%), 42 patients with stable disease (27.7%), 39 cases were defined as progressors (25.7%), and 39 patients with HP (25.7%). Pretreatment tissue samples from all patients with HP showed tumor infiltration by M2-like CD163+CD33+PD-L1+ clustered epithelioid macrophages. Enrichment by tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) was observed, even in tumor nodules from immunodeficient mice injected with human lung cancer cells and with PDXs. In these models, tumor growth was enhanced by treatment with anti-PD-1 but not anti-PD-1 F(ab)2 fragments. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a crucial role of TAM reprogramming, upon Fc receptor engagement by ICI, eventually inducing HP and provide clues on a distinctive immunophenotype potentially able to predict HP.See related commentary by Knorr and Ravetch, p. 904.©2018 American Association for Cancer Research."

We recently observed a patient with lung cancer who developed a fulminant warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). OBJECTIVES: Investigate the frequency and prognosis of AIHA secondary to CPI in a public database and review the literature. RESULTS: A total of 68 cases were identified in the database of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 43 were associated with nivolumab, 13 with pembrolizumab, seven with ipilimumab, and five with atezolizumab. All episodes of AIHA were listed as serious. If the total number of adverse events cases reported to the FDA is taken as a reference, AIHA is rare, but occurred more frequently with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents (0.15%-0.25%) than with CTLA-4 inhibitors (0.06%). In addition to our case, the literature review identified 11 similar cases. Most cases of AIHA responded to steroids, but two of 12 were fatal.

ICI are approved for the treatment of malign melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. They can lead to long-term anti-tumor responses by deactivating the brake mechanism in the immune system. Ipilimumab, tremelimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab are examples of ICI. CTLA-4 is a brake mechanism in immune response. Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are antibodies against CTLA-4. PD-1 is another important immune checkpoint co-inhibitor receptor that is expressed by activated T cells in the peripheral tissue. As a result of blockage of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, local tumor-specific immune response augments, and long-term tumor control can be achieved. In recent years, ICI are approved for the treatment of various malignities. They may be responsible for specific toxicities called immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs are a consequence infiltration of normal tissues by activated T lymphocytes that are responsible for autoimmunity. Corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, such as infliximab and mycophenolate mofetil, are effective in the treatment of irAEs. Immune checkpoint inhibition with monoclonal antibodies against CTLA-4 and/or PD-1/PD-L1 by single agent or combination treatments became a new option in various solid tumors. However, ICI have unique adverse events, and these adverse events should be considered in any new onset clinical situation and should be managed properly. Future prospective randomized clinical trials will clarify recent questions."

Associations between these biomarkers and the clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a clinical trial that encompassed 20 cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: KEYNOTE-028 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054806) is a nonrandomized, phase Ib trial that enrolled 475 patients with PD-L1-positive advanced solid tumors who were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 2 years or until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; by RECIST v1.1, investigator review). Secondary end points included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Relationships between T-cell-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB and antitumor activity were exploratory end points. RESULTS: ORRs (with 95% CIs) ranged from 0% (0.0% to 14.2%) in pancreatic cancer to 33% (15.6% to 55.3%) in small-cell lung cancer. Across cohorts, median (95% CI) PFS ranged from 1.7 months (1.5 to 2.9 months) to 6.8 months (1.9 to 14.1 months) in pancreatic and thyroid cancers, respectively, and median OS from 3.9 months (2.8 to 5.5 months) to 21.1 months (9.1 to 22.4 months) in vulvar and carcinoid tumors, respectively. Higher response rates and longer PFS were demonstrated in tumors with higher T-cell-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and/or TMB. Correlations of TMB with GEP and PD-L1 were low. Response patterns indicate that patients with tumors that had high levels of both TMB and inflammatory markers (GEP or PD-L1) represent a population with the highest likelihood of response. Safety was similar and consistent with prior pembrolizumab reports. CONCLUSION: A T-cell--inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB predicted response to pembrolizumab in multiple tumor types. These biomarkers (alone/in combination) may help identify patients who have a higher likelihood of response to anti-PD-1 therapies across a broad spectrum of cancers."

Clinical experience with response prediction based on PD-L1 expression suggests that other factors influence sensitivity to ICIs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: Tumor specimens from 120 NSCLC patients from 10 institutions were evaluated for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and global proliferative profile by targeted RNA-seq. RESULTS: Cell proliferation, derived from the mean expression of 10 proliferation-associated genes (namely BUB1, CCNB2, CDK1, CDKN3, FOXM1, KIAA0101, MAD2L1, MELK, MKI67, and TOP2A), was identified as a marker of response to ICIs in NSCLC. Poorly, moderately, and highly proliferative tumors were somewhat equally represented in NSCLC, with tumors with the highest PD-L1 expression being more frequently moderately proliferative as compared to lesser levels of PD-L1 expression. Proliferation status had an impact on survival in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. There was a significant survival advantage for moderately proliferative tumors compared to their combined highly/poorly counterparts (p = 0.021). Moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors had a median survival of 14.6 months that was almost twice that of PD-L1 negative highly/poorly proliferative at 7.6 months (p = 0.028). Median survival in moderately proliferative PD-L1 negative tumors at 12.6 months was comparable to that of highly/poorly proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors at 11.5 months, but in both instances less than that of moderately proliferative PD-L1 positive tumors. Similar to survival, proliferation status has impact on disease control (DC) in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. Patients with moderately versus those with poorly or highly proliferative tumors have a superior DC rate when combined with any classification schema used to score PD-L1 as a positive result (i.e., TPS ≥ 50% or ≥ 1%), and best displayed by a DC rate for moderately proliferative tumors of no less than 40% for any classification of PD-L1 as a negative result. While there is an over representation of moderately proliferative tumors as PD-L1 expression increases this does not account for the improved survival or higher disease control rates seen in PD-L1 negative tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Cell proliferation is potentially a new biomarker of response to ICIs in NSCLC and is applicable to PD-L1 negative tumors."

The risk of pneumonitis associated with checkpoint inhibition therapy is not well described. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing anti-PD/PD-L1 mono-immunotherapy (IMM) to chemotherapy (CTH) protocols in cancer patients. The primary endpoint was the pneumonitis rate in IMM compared to CTH. Secondary endpoints were (I) high-grade pneumonitis rate in IMM compared to CTH and (II) tumor response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) between IMM and CTH. Random model and leave-one-out-analysis were performed. Results: Thirteen RCTs studying 7,246 patients were included; 3,704 (51.12%) patients in the IMM arm and 3,542 (48.88%) patients in the chemotherapy arm. Seven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) RCTs were included with 4,164 patients; 2,101 in the IMM arm and 2,063 patients in the CTH arm. Three RCTs were on melanoma patients (n=1,390). Nine RCTs compared mono-immunotherapy to CTH [docetaxel in 5 studies (38.5%), platinum-based in 2 studies (15.4%), dacarbazine in 1 study (7.7%) and everolimus in 1 study]. Both high-grade and all-grade pneumonitis were higher among patients in the IMM arm when compared to the CTH arm (OR =4.39, 95% CI: 1.65-11.69, P=0.003 and OR =2.46, 95% CI: 1.29-4.6, P=0.007). Tumor response rate was significantly better in the immunotherapy arm (OR =2.31, 95% CI: 1.62-3.29, P<0.001). PFS and OS were longer in patients who received IMM compared to patients in the CTH arm (HR =0.75, 95% CI: 0.65-0.85, P<0.001, and HR =0.71, 95% CI: 0.66-0.77, P<0.001). Conclusions: The incidence of high-grade and all-grade pneumonitis is higher in anti-PD-1 therapy but not in anti-PD-L1 therapy when compared to traditional CTH regimens for NSCLC and melanoma. High-grade adverse events were otherwise more common in the CTH arm. Tumor response rate, PFS, and OS are all substantially improved with IMM over CTH. These results can be used to guide therapy selection and set expectations for treatment effect in these patients."

Therefore, it is important to elucidate the clinical and pathological features of tumors with IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and the association between IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and efficacy of combination therapy in NSCLC patients. In this study, we examined the prognostic impact of IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression and its relationship with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in primary lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of IDO1, PD-L1, Ki-67, cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), CD4, and CD8 in 202 patients with surgically resected primary lung SCC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Among 202 patients, 176 (87.1%) were positive for IDO1 expression, 106 (52.5%) were positive for PD-L1 expression, and 99 (49.0%) showed co-expression of IDO1/PD-L1 proteins. Fishers exact test showed a significant association between IDO1 and PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (P =  0.0011). Kaplan-Meier curve showed that PD-L1 alone and co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 were significantly associated with shorter overall survival, but IDO1 alone was not (log rank test: P =  0.0122, P =  0.0303 and P =  0.5168, respectively). The Ki-67 labeling index was significantly higher in patients with co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 than in patients without co-expression (Students t-test: P =  0.0005). Moreover, IDO1/PD-L1 co-expression was significantly associated with high CD3, CD4, and CD8 expression (Fishers exact test: P =  0.0033, P =  0.0003, and P <  0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: IDO1 expression correlated to PD-L1 expression, and co-expression of IDO1 and PD-L1 may be important targets for immunotherapy in lung SCC."

We performed a trial-based correlative analysis to evaluate conventional endpoints as surrogates for predicting OS in ICI-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: A systematic electronic literature search for randomized clinical trials using ICI monotherapies for NSCLC revealed 7 trials. The correlative analysis to clarify the correlations among clinical outcomes used a weighted Spearman rank correlation coefficient (wS), weighted Pearson correlation coefficient (wP), and weighted linear regression model (wL) in all patients and patients with high PD-L1 expression. RESULTS: The correlative analysis of the total population revealed that the odds ratio of the ORR (OR-ORR) and the hazard ratio of OS (HR-OS) were strongly correlated with the hazard ratio of PFS (HR-PFS) (R for wP and wS, R2 for wL; -0.869, -0.968, 0.756 between OR-ORR and HR-PFS; 0.923, 0.959, 0.851 between HR-PFS and HR-OS). The strongest correlation was observed between one-year overall survival (1y-OS) and the HR-OS (R for wP and wS, R2 for wL; 0.985, 1.000, R2: 0.968). In those with high PD-L1 expression, the ORR and PFS were strongly associated with OS (R2: 0.842 between ORR and OS; 0.771 between PFS and OS). CONCLUSIONS: The OR-ORR and HR-PFS could serve as surrogate endpoints for predicting the HR-OS in randomized trials using ICIs for NSCLC, while the ORR and PFS could be useful endpoints for predicting OS in trials with patient selection based on high PD-L1 expression."

The present report describes a 71-year-old man with clear cell renal cell carcinoma metastasis in the lung. Following the 14th course of nivolumab therapy, the patient complained of general malaise, loss of appetite and mild consciousness disturbance. Laboratory tests revealed a severely elevated eosinophil ratio (26.2%) and low sodium value (122 mmol/l). Endocrine system tests revealed that the patients adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 4.5 pg/ml) and cortisol (0.1 µg/dl) levels were lower than normal, while those of other pituitary hormones were higher than normal. This case was therefore diagnosed as isolated ACTH deficiency induced by nivolumab. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal pituitary glands. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy improved the clinical symptoms early and enabled the patient to restart nivolumab therapy. Isolated ACTH deficiency due to nivolumab, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, is a rare occurrence. This report may be useful for avoiding delays in the diagnosis and treatment of this life-threatening irAE even if no pituitary abnormalities are identified via MRI."

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy provides ready access to relevant tissue samples; however, the minute amounts of sample require sensitive multiplex molecular analysis to be of clinical biomarker utility. We have applied proximity extension assays (PEA) to analyze 167 proteins in FNA samples from patients with breast cancer (BC; n = 25) and benign lesions (n = 32). We demonstrate that the FNA BC samples could be divided into two main clusters, characterized by differences in expression levels of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the proliferation marker Ki67. This clustering corresponded to some extent to established BC subtypes. Our analysis also revealed several proteins whose expression levels differed between BC and benign lesions (e.g., CA9, GZMB, IL-6, VEGFA, CXCL11, PDL1, and PCD1), as well as several chemokines correlating with ER and Ki67 status (e.g., CCL4, CCL8, CCL20, CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL17). Finally, we also identified three signatures that could predict Ki67 status, ER status, and tumor grade, respectively, based on a small subset of proteins, which was dominated by chemokines. To our knowledge, expression profiles of CCL13 in benign lesions and BC have not previously been described but were shown herein to correlate with proliferation (P = 0.00095), suggesting a role in advanced BC. Given the broad functional range of the proteins analyzed, immune-related proteins were overrepresented among the observed alterations. Our pilot study supports the emerging role of chemokines in BC progression. Due to the minimally traumatic sampling and clinically important molecular information for therapeutic decisions, this methodology is promising for future immunoscoring and monitoring of treatment efficacy in BC.© 2018 The Authors.

Regarding infectious complications, it has emerged that these compounds do not intrinsically increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections, which mainly correlate with the co-administration of systemic immunosuppressive therapy (high-dose corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis factors inhibitors) to cure immune-related adverse events (colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis and pancreatitis), well-known complications of these targeted drugs. These observations lead experts opinion to suggest primary anti-Pneumocystis prophylaxis in patients undergoing CTLA-4 and PD-1/PDL1 agents who will receive prednisone 20 mg daily for ≥ 4 weeks. Few data on invasive fungal infections in this context are available. We report here a case of probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (p-IPA) complicating first-line immunotherapy with pembrolizumab for metastatic lung cancer that was further aggravated by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa superinfection of fungal cavities; the patient received concurrent systemic corticosteroid therapy as anti-edema treatment for cerebral metastases. Reviewing literature about Aspergillus diseases in subjects receiving CTLA-4 and PD-1 and PDL1-targeted agents, we found three cases of invasive aspergillosis and one case of exacerbation of chronic progressive pulmonary aspergillosis after nivolumab treatment; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of p-IPA complicating pembrolizumab immunotherapy. Briefly, in this new setting of biological/targeted drugs, waiting for growing clinical experience, we recommend a high level of alertness in diagnosing any infectious complications."

Unlike the current therapies that target tumor cells, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy, ICIs directly restore the exhausted host antitumor immune responses mediated by the tumors. Among multiple immune modulators identified, the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis leading to the exhaustion of T-cell immunity in chronic infections and tumors has been widely investigated. Therefore, blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 have been developed and approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them the most successful ICIs. Compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy significantly improves the durable response rate and prolongs long-term survival with limited adverse effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy for advanced NSCLC. However, extensive challenges exist for further clinical applications, such as a small fraction of benefit population, primary and acquired resistance, the lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and treatment-related adverse effects. In this article, we summarize the latest clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide, as well as in China, and discuss the bottlenecks related to the use of this therapy in clinical practice. An exploration of the underlying mechanism of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and biomarker identification will maximize the application of ICIs in advanced NSCLC and facilitate bedside-to-bench studies in cancer immunotherapy as well. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) display apparent benefits for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical applications of these therapies are challenged by the limited benefit population with additional high economic burden and adverse events. This review discusses the bottlenecks of ICI therapy in clinical practice and provides appropriate guidance in the development of predictive biomarkers, the establishment of the criteria for combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy with the existing therapies, and the management of adverse events observed both in monotherapy and combination therapy, which will help maximize the applications of ICIs in advanced NSCLC.© AlphaMed Press 2019."

The recent emergence of immunotherapy treatment options, such as the use of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint inhibitors, has also led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and has provided promising directions for the treatment of small cell lung cancer. This review provides a summary of the developmental process of immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer, ongoing international and domestic clinical trials in this field, and the challenges and considerations related to the use of immunotherapy in Chinese patients with lung cancer, with the aim of providing detailed information for future immunotherapy-related clinical trials in China. Research regarding immune checkpoint inhibitors in China is several years behind similar research in several developed countries. However, although PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-related clinical trials remain in their early stages in China, increased efforts by Chinese clinicians, researchers, and government staff have been directed toward trying to introduce novel drugs into the clinical setting. Because of the specific characteristics of Chinese patients with lung cancer (such as high epidermal growth factor receptor mutation rates, later disease stages, and different toxicity profiles), large-scale clinical trials targeting the Chinese population or Chinese participation in multinational trials should be promoted. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality, lung cancer is a major public health problem in China. Immunotherapy based on programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 checkpoint inhibitors may result in new treatment directions and a paradigm shift for Chinese patients with lung cancer. Although checkpoint inhibitor-related clinical trials remain in their early stages in China, increased efforts by Chinese clinicians, researchers, and government staff have been directed toward trying to introduce novel drugs into the clinical setting by encouraging the development of large-scale clinical trials targeting the Chinese population and promoting Chinese patients with lung cancer to participate in international trials.© AlphaMed Press 2019."

Whilst the field is rapidly evolving and the list of drugs receiving regulatory approval for the treatment of various cancers is fast growing, the group of PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors is establishing a leading role amongst immunomodulatory agents. PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors act against pathways involved in adaptive immune suppression resulting in immune checkpoint blockade. Within the last four years two PD-1 and three PD-L1 inhibitors have been utilized in clinical practice against a variety of malignancies. Focus was initially placed on targeting cancers considered immunogenic such as melanoma, renal and lung cancers but subsequently the application expanded to include amongst others Hodgkin Lymphoma, urothelial as well as head and neck cancer. This article provides a comprehensive review of the early and late phase trials that led to the regulatory approval of all five PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors in the corresponding cancer types. It presents available data on the combinations of PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors with other therapies (immunotherapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy), the toxicity profile of the PD1- PDL-1 inhibitors and ongoing trials testing the efficacy of these agents in cancer types beyond those that have been addressed already. Finally, current and future challenges in the application of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are discussed with emphasis on the role of predictive biomarkers."

According to published studies, PD1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have a better toxicity profile than chemotherapy. Nevertheless, some immune related toxicities can be potentially severe, such as induced interstitial lung disease (ILD). Currently, ILD patients are excluded from clinical trials using immunotherapy in lung cancer. IPF is the most frequent and severe form of ILD. Lung cancer represents a major complication of this disease and to date few data exist on the safety of immunotherapy in this context. We report 3 cases of IPF with lung cancer treated by nivolumab. All had a clinically mild to moderate IPF. The patients had received at least one line of chemotherapy before nivolumab and had progressive, metastatic lung cancer. Two patients experienced rapid cancer progression without immune toxicities. The third had a partial response but developed grade III immune colitis that led to discontinuation of the treatment. None developed lung toxicity or worsening of IPF on CT during follow-up, and death was always related to progression of the cancer. In our series of three patients with IPF, nivolumab was well tolerated with regard to their pulmonary condition. As inflammation and autoimmunity are probably marginal mechanisms in the pathogenesis of IPF, we do not believe that the presence of IPF should definitely disqualify potential candidates for treatment with nivolumab. Decisions should be taken, case-by-case, in selected patients without severe IPF and with no evidence of autoimmunity. In view of the epidemiology of lung cancer in IPF and the critical role of immunotherapy in the management of lung cancer, studies of prospective cohorts are urgently needed in this population."

However, the underlying synergistic mechanisms remain uncertain. The blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) can reflect the number of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated neutrophils. The immunosuppressive status of the tumor microenvironment could be monitored by the time-series patterns of NLR and ANC. The dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab treatment were retrospectively explored in 15 patients: 8 patients receiving subsequent salvage chemotherapy (2 groups: 3 non-responders and 5 responders), and 7 responders to nivolumab alone (2 groups: 4 partial response and 3 complete response). The dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab differed among these four groups (NLR P = 0.045, ANC P = 0.067). NLR and ANC during nivolumab treatment increased over time in non-responders to salvage chemotherapy, with an inverse relationship between drug response and NLR or ANC at four to six weeks among the four groups. We hypothesize that the early dynamics of NLR and ANC during nivolumab may be associated with the late efficacy of subsequent salvage chemotherapy. Further studies involving a large cohort are needed to confirm these findings, which could provide insight into the role of myeloid immunosuppressor cells in combination PD-1 blockade and chemotherapy.© 2018 The Authors.

Because of the systemic nature and heterogeneity of tumoral diseases, as well as the immune restoration process induced by immunotherapy, the assessment of therapeutic efficacy is challenging, and the role of FDG PET is not well established. We evaluated the potential of FDG PET to monitor NSCLC patients treated with a checkpoint inhibitor. RESULTS: This was a retrospective analysis of 28 NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blocker. All patients underwent a PET scan before treatment (SCAN-1) and another scan 2 months later (SCAN-2). Disease progression was assessed by immune PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (iPERCIST), which was adapted from PERCIST; and the immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST). iPERCIST is a dual-time-point evaluation of "unconfirmed progressive metabolic disease" (UPMD) status at SCAN-2. UPMD at SCAN-2 was re-evaluated after 4 weeks with SCAN-3 to confirm PMD. Patients with complete/partial metabolic response (CMR or PMR) or stable metabolic disease (SMD) at SCAN-2 or -3 were considered responders. Patients with UPMD confirmed at SCAN-3 were considered non-responders. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival. At SCAN-2, we found 9/28 cases of PMR, 4/28 cases of SMD, 2/28 cases of CMR, and 13/28 cases of UPMD. Four of the 13 UPMD patients were classified as responders at SCAN-3 (PMR n = 1, SMD n = 3). The remaining nine UPMD patients were classified as non-responders due to clinical degradation, and treatment was stopped. The median follow-up was 16.7 months [3.6-32.2]. Responders continued treatment for a mean of 10.7 months [3.8-26.3]. Overall survival was longer for responders than that for non-responders (19.9 vs. 3.6 months, log rank p = 0.0003). The 1-year survival rates were 94% for responders and 11% for non-responders. A comparison with iRECIST showed reclassification in 39% (11/28) of patients with relevant additional prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: iPERCIST dual-time-point evaluation might be a powerful tool for evaluating anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy, with the ability to identify patients who can benefit most from treatment. The prognostic value of iPERCIST criteria should be confirmed in large prospective multicentric studies."

Melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells were shunted to the lung in the presence of the infection, where they expressed high levels of inflammation-induced cell-activation blocker PD-1, and became incapable of migrating back to the tumor site. At the same time, co-infection virus-specific CD8+ T cells remained functional while the infection was cleared. It was also unexpectedly found that PD-1 blockade immunotherapy reversed this effect. Here, we proceed to ground the experimental observations in a mechanistic immunobiochemical model that incorporates T cell pathways that control PD-1 expression. A core component of our model is a kinetic motif, which we call a PD-1 Double Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (DIFFL), and which reflects known interactions between IRF4, Blimp-1, and Bcl-6. The different activity levels of the PD-1 DIFFL components, as a function of the cognate antigen levels and the given inflammation context, manifest themselves in phenotypically distinct outcomes. Collectively, the model allowed us to put forward a few working hypotheses as follows: (i) the melanoma-specific CD8+ T cells re-circulating with the blood flow enter the lung where they express high levels of inflammation-induced cell-activation blocker PD-1 in the presence of infection; (ii) when PD-1 receptors interact with abundant PD-L1, constitutively expressed in the lung, T cells loose motility; (iii) at the same time, virus-specific cells adapt to strong stimulation by their cognate antigen by lowering the transiently-elevated expression of PD-1, remaining functional and mobile in the inflamed lung, while the infection is cleared. The role that T cell receptor (TCR) activation and feedback loops play in the underlying processes are also highlighted and discussed. We hope that the results reported in our study could potentially contribute to the advancement of immunological approaches to cancer treatment and, as well, to a better understanding of a broader complexity of fundamental interactions between pathogens and tumors."

Although immunotherapeutic agents generally have a favourable toxicity profile compared to chemotherapy, they can provoke immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) caused by an unregulated and hyperstimulated immune response. Some of these effects can be serious and life-threatening. AIMS: Our aim was to compare the utilisation of immunotherapy and the rates, management and outcomes of irAEs between a regional oncology service and a tertiary service. METHOD: We reviewed the medical records for all patients treated with immunotherapy in the participating services for the five year period from 31st July 2012 to 31st July 2017. RESULTS: Data demonstrated that rates of immunotherapy use are both similar and increasing across the tertiary and regional services. The rates, types and severity of irAEs are equivalent and in concordance with pre-existing literature. Immune-related adverse events appear to be identified and treated earlier in the regional service with corresponding reduction in the duration of immunosuppression and requirement for inpatient management.

After 20 courses of nivolumab therapy, he had nausea, appetite loss, and difficulty walking. A close laboratory examination led to the diagnosis of isolated ACTH deficiency in this patient. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy led to amelioration of his symptoms and allowed him to continue with nivolumab therapy. The present case of isolated ACTH deficiency was characterized by a slowly progressive decline in the serum sodium level, which became manifest well before appearance of any clinical symptoms, suggesting that the serum sodium level may be used to predict progression to isolated ACTH deficiency.Thus, not only serum sodium levels need to be monitored in patients suspected of having isolated ACTH deficiency, but ACTH and cortisol levels need to be monitored in those exhibiting a decline in serum sodium levels.

However, a disruption of the immune checkpoint function by blocking PD-1/PD-ligand 1(PD-L1) signaling may trigger myasthenia gravis (MG) as a life-threatening immune-related adverse event. MG is a neuromuscular disease and is closely associated with being positive for anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) Abs, which are high specific and diagnostic Abs for MG. METHODS: A 72-year-old man was diagnosed with chemotherapy-refractory lung squamous cell carcinoma and nivolumab was selected as the third-line regimen. We describe the first report of an anti-AChR Ab-seropositive lung cancer patient achieving a durable complete response (CR) to an anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. To further explore this case, we performed multiplex immunofluorescence analysis on a pretreatment tumor. RESULTS: The patient achieved a durable CR without developing MG. However, the levels of anti-AChR Abs were elevated during two years of anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. The tumor of the subclinical MG patient had high PD-L1 expression and an infiltrated⁻inflamed tumor immune microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors can be safely used and provide the benefits for advanced cancer patients with immunologically hot tumor even if anti-AChR Abs are positive. Although careful monitoring clinical manifestation in consultation with neurologist is needed, immune checkpoint inhibitors should be considered as a treatment option for asymptomatic anti-AChR Ab-seropositive cancer patients."

However this has not been validated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer due to the difficulty to obtain serial biopsies. Measuring PD-L1 expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may allow real-time monitoring of immune activation in tumor. In this study, whole blood from non-metastatic NSCLC patients was collected before, during, and after radiation or chemoradiation using a microfluidic chip. PD-L1 expression in CTCs was assessed by immunofluorescence and qPCR and monitored through the course of treatment. Overall, PD-L1(+) CTCs were detected in 25 out of 38 samples (69.4%) with an average of 4.5 cells/ml. After initiation of radiation therapy, the proportion of PD-L1(+) CTCs increased significantly (median 0.7% vs. 24.7%, P < 0.01), indicating up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells in response to radiation. In addition, patients positive for PD-L1 (≥5% of CTCs positive for PD-L1) at baseline had shorter PFS. Gene expression analysis revealed that higher levels of PD-L1 were associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, CTCs can be used to monitor dynamic changes of PD-L1 during radiation therapy which is potentially prognostic of response to treatment."

However, only a quarter of patients benefit from this therapy with objective clinical response. In this context, there is an unmet need for improved understanding of resistance mechanisms. Thus, we studied a prospective cohort of mNSCLC (n = 61) treated in second or third-line with nivolumab. We analyzed various blood myeloid and lymphoid markers by flow cytometry (176 variables) at baseline, and after 15 and 30 days of therapy. By attempting to link the evolution of peripheral lymphoid, myeloid cells and anti-PD-1 response, we observed that accumulation of lymphoid cells and monocytic MDSC (mMDSC) expressing, respectively, Tim-3 and galectin-9 is implicated in resistance to PD-1 blockade both for patients with primary or acquired secondary resistance to anti-PD-1. In vitro, anti-Tim-3 blocking antibody reverses resistance to anti-PD-1 in PBMC from lung cancer patients and high levels of blood mMDSC negatively impact on anti-PD-1 efficacy. Together, these data underline that the galectin-9/Tim-3 pathway and mMDSC are key mechanisms of primary or secondary resistance to anti-PD-1 and could be a new target for immunotherapy drug combinations."

This study investigated the immune response to MTB infection on lung metastasis in lung cancer cells via T cell-mediated immune response. To clarify this problem, we analyzed the expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 and immune function in antigen-specific T cell as derived from MTB patients or spleen lymphocytes derived from wild-type and PD-1 knockout mice with MTB antigen stimulation and Lewis lung cancer cells injection. Our data indicate that the expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 were elevated in active pulmonary TB patients, as well as in mice received MTB and lung cancer cells treatment. We also observed the T cell-mediated cellular immune response were inhibited by MTB while MTB significantly promote tumor metastasis in lung. In conclusion, the PD-1/PD-L pathway is required MTB repressed T-cell immune response and promotes tumor metastasis. This study provides evidence that blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway may benefit patients with MTB or other chronic infection and even prevent them from development of cancer."

In lung cancer, anti-PD-1 therapy significantly improves patient survival through activation of T cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Direct contact between CD8+ T cells and target cells is necessary for CD8+ T cell activity, indicating that spatial organization of immune cells within the TME reflects a critical process in anti-tumor immunity. Current immunohistochemistry (IHC) imaging techniques identify immune cell numbers and densities, but lack assessment of cell-cell spatial relationships (or "cell sociology"). Immune functionality, however, is often dictated by cell-to-cell contact and cannot be resolved by simple metrics of cell density (for example, number of cells per mm2). To address this issue, we developed a Hyperspectral Cell Sociology technology platform for the analysis of cell-cell interactions in multi-channel IHC-stained tissue. METHODS: Tissue sections of primary tumors from lung adenocarcinoma patients with known clinical outcome were stained using multiplex IHC for CD3, CD8, and CD79a, and hyperspectral image analysis determined the phenotype of all cells. A Voronoi diagram for each cell was used to approximate cell boundaries, and the cell type of all neighboring cells was identified and quantified. Monte Carlo analysis was used to assess whether cell sociology patterns were likely due to random distributions of the cells. RESULTS: High density of intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells was significantly associated with non-recurrence of tumors. A cell sociology pattern of CD8+ T cells surrounded by tumor cells was more significantly associated with non-recurrence compared to CD8+ T cell density alone. CD3+ CD8- T cells surrounded by tumor cells was also associated with non-recurrence, but at a similar significance as cell density alone. Cell sociology metrics improved recurrence classifications of 12 patients. Monte Carlo re-sampling analysis determined that these cell sociology patterns were non-random. CONCLUSION: Hyperspectral Cell Sociology expands our understanding of the complex interplay between tumor cells and immune infiltrate. This technology could improve predictions of responses to immunotherapy and lead to a deeper understanding of anti-tumor immunity."

Recent advances in antitumor immunity brought to the discovery of checkpoints that modulate immune response against cancer. One of them is programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1). Although PD-L1 expression seems predictive of response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents, its prognostic value is unclear. In this study we investigated the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression and its correlation with clinical-pathological characteristics in a cohort of surgically resected NSCLC. Material and methods: PD-L1 expression was evaluated in 289 surgically resected NSCLC samples by immunohistochemistry. Our cohort included patients not exposed to adjuvant chemotherapy. PD-L1 status was defined as: 1) PD-L1 high (tumor proportion score, TPS≥50%), PD-L1 low (TPS 1-49%), PD-L1 negative (TPS<1%); 2) PD-L1 positive (TPS≥50%) and negative (TPS<50%); 3) as a continuous variable. Results: Patients were mostly males (79%), former or current smokers (81%), with a median age of 67 years, non-squamous histology (67.5%) and high-grade tumors (55%). PD-L1 tumors were 18.7%. There was no significant association with sex, age, smoking status and histology. A strong correlation between high PD-L1 expression and tumor grade was detected. The difference in median OS in the different groups of patients was not statistically significant. Conclusion: PD-L1 is not prognostic in surgically resected NSCLC. The association with tumor differentiation suggests that grading could represent an easy-to-assess tool for selecting subjects potentially sensitive to immunotherapy warranting further investigations."

PD-1 blocking antibodies constitute an essential treatment option for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors in lymphangioleiomyomatosis patients with non-small cell lung cancer is unknown: concomitant symptomatic interstitial lung disease or the use of immunosuppressors was a key exclusion criterion in the original studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially regarding the risk of interstitial lung disease exacerbation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old female, active smoker (36 pack-years), diagnosed with sporadic LAM since 2004 suffered from metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. Third-line therapy with nivolumab was started in 2015, with a major partial response. Due to pulmonary function alterations, sirolimus was also reinitiated in 2017 in conjunction with nivolumab, without any undesirable effects and a major partial response continuing up to May 2018. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the safe and effective use of nivolumab for managing metastatic lung adenocarcinoma that occurred in a patient with sporadic LAM. In the current case, immunotherapy proved highly successful in managing the NSCLC tumor that occurred upon LAM follow-up, with both a significantly prolonged partial response and acceptable safety profile."

Here, we analysed two different types of tissue microarrays of healthy lymphatic and various inflamed tissues, colorectal and lung cancers, as well as >1700 tumour samples from 86 different tumour entities for TIGIT and/or PD-1 by bright field and/or multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry. TIGIT was detected in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ T helper cells, FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, and NK cells, but not in CD11c+ dendritic cells, CD68+ macrophages, and CD20+ B lymphocytes. TIGIT expression paralleled that of PD-1. More than 70% of TIGIT+ cells were PD-1+, and more than 90% of the PD-1+ cells were TIGIT+. Expression varied between different tissue compartments. TIGIT expression in tonsil gradually increased from the interfollicular area over the marginal/mantle zone to the germinal centre in all T cell subtypes. In inflammatory diseases, the strongest expression of TIGIT/PD-1 was found in Hashimoto thyroiditis. TIGIT+ lymphocytes were seen in all 86 different tumour entities with considerable high variability of TIGIT positivity within and between different cancer entities. Particularly, high densities of TIGIT+ lymphocytes were, for example, seen in squamous cell cancers of various origins. In summary, the variable expression levels of TIGIT and PD-1 in cell types and tissue compartments illustrate the high complexity of immune microenvironments. The high frequency of TIGIT (and PD-1) expressing lymphocytes in cancers highlights considerable opportunities for cotargeting with checkpoint inhibitors."

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a promising oncolytic virus that has inhibitory effects on a number of cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer. One of the major mechanisms of resistance to VSV infection is the type I interferon (IFN) response, leading to the development of VSV expressing IFNβ which will lead to resistance of viral replication in normal cells which have intact IFN signaling but allow replication in cancer cells with defective IFNβ signaling. However, some cancer cells have intact or partially intact IFN signaling pathways leading to resistance to virotherapy. Here we utilized JAK/STAT inhibitor, ruxolitinib, in combination with VSV-IFNβ to see if inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling will enhance VSV-IFNβ therapy for lung cancer. We used five human and two murine NSCLC cell lines in vitro, and the combination treatment was assayed for cytotoxicity. We performed western blots on treated cells to see the effects of ruxolitinib on JAK/STAT signaling and PDL-1 expression in treated cells. Finally, the combination of VSV-IFNβ and ruxolitinib was tested in an immune competent murine model of NSCLC. Ruxolitinib enhanced virotherapy in resistant and sensitive NSCLC cells. The addition of ruxolitinib inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation and to a lesser extent STAT3 phosphorylation. Ruxolitinib treatment prevented NSCLC cells from enhancing PDL-1 expression in response to virotherapy. Combination ruxolitinib and VSV-IFNβ therapy resulted in a trend toward improved survival of mice without substantially effecting PDL-1 levels or levels of immune infiltration into the tumor. These results support further clinical evaluation of the combination of JAK/STAT inhibition with virotherapy."

Results: In all, 137 patients (33%) did not express PD-L1, 155 (38%) showed low expression, and 119 (29%) demonstrated high expression. Archival samples showed lower PD-L1 expression than that of recent samples, and the ratios of no expression case significantly increased by using paraffin blocks embedded particularly in more than 4 years ago. Programmed death-ligand 1 positivity was significantly associated with male sex, smoking, higher tumor grade, squamous cell carcinoma in histologic type, wild-type EGFR, and ALK rearrangement positive. Conclusions: The rate of 22C3-PD-L1 expression of NSCLC detected in this study was similar to the frequencies of the previous reports, although the ratio of expression case decreased when using old paraffin blocks."

METHODS: Two cohorts of lung cancer patients with BM were analyzed. Cohort 1 included 18 patients treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab, and intra- and extracranial responses were assessed. Cohort 2 comprised 20 patients who underwent both primary lung surgery and brain metastasectomy. Specimens from cohort 2 were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for the following markers: CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, and PD-1 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and PD-L1 on tumor cells. RESULTS: Seven patients (38.9%) in cohort 1 showed progressive disease in both primary and intracranial lesions. Although the other 11 patients exhibited a partial response or stable disease in the primary lesion, eight showed a progression in BM. Interestingly, PD-1+ TILs were significantly decreased in BM (P = 0.034). For fifteen patients with adenocarcinoma, more distinctive patterns were observed in CD3+ (P = 0.078), CD8+ (P = 0.055), FOXP3+ (P = 0.016), and PD-1+ (P = 0.016) TILs. CONCLUSIONS: There may be discordant responses to an ICI of lung cancer between primary lung lesion and BM based on discrepancies in the tumor microenvironment. The diminished infiltration of PD-1+ TILs in tumor tissue within the brain may be one of the major factors that hinder the response to anti-PD-1 antibody in BM."

However, most of the current antiangiogenic agents cannot discriminate tumor angiogenesis from physiological angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent that targets CD276, a receptor overexpressed in various tumor cells and tumor vasculature but with limited expression in normal tissue vasculature, could improve the tumor inhibitory efficacy of a PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. A CD276-targeting agent (IRD-αCD276/Fab) was synthesized by conjugating the Fab fragment of an anti-CD276 antibody with a photosensitizer IRDye700. The in vivo tumor-targeting efficacy and therapeutic effects of IRD-αCD276/Fab with or without an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade were tested in subcutaneous and lung metastatic tumor models. PDT using IRD-αCD276/Fab significantly suppressed the growth of subcutaneous 4T1 tumor and inhibited its lung metastasis. Moreover, it triggered in vivo antitumor immunity by increasing the activation and maturation of dendritic cells. Tumor PD-L1 levels were also markedly increased after PDT using IRD-αCD276/Fab, as evidenced by noninvasive PD-L1-targeted small-animal PET imaging. In combination with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, IRD-αCD276/Fab PDT markedly suppressed the growth of tumors and prevented their metastasis to the lung by recruiting the tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells. Our data provide evidence for the role of CD276-targeted PDT for local immune modulation, and its combination with PD-L1/PD-1 axis inhibition is a promising strategy for eliminating primary tumors as well as disseminated metastases, by generating local and systemic antitumor responses."

Here, we discuss effects of SFN on the immune defense system. In contrast to the situation in tumor cells, SFN acts pro-oxidatively in primary human T cells. It increases intracellular ROS levels and decreases GSH, resulting in inhibition of T cell activation and T cell effector functions. Regarding the use of SFN as an "anticancer agent" we conclude that SFN could act as a double-edged sword. On the one hand it reduces carcinogenesis, on the other hand it blocks the T cell-mediated immune response, the latter being important for immune surveillance of tumors. Thus, SFN could also interfere with the successful application of immunotherapy by immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. CTLA-4 antibodies and PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) or CAR T cells. Therefore, a combination of SFN with T cell-mediated cancer immunotherapies does not seem advisable."

Long-term survival and immune-related adverse events.","Immunotherapy delivered a new therapeutic option to the oncologist: Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab (anti-PD1), and Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) increase overall survival and show a better safety profile compared to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma, lung, renal cancer among others. But all that glitters is not gold and there is an increasing number of reports of adverse effects while using immune-checkpoint inhibitors. While chemotherapy could weaken the immune system, this novel immunotherapy could hyper-activate it, resulting in a unique and distinct spectrum of adverse events, called immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). IRAEs, ranging from mild to potentially life-threatening events, can involve many systems, and their management is radically different from that of cytotoxic drugs: immunosuppressive treatments, such as corticoids, infliximab or mycophenolate mofetil, usually result in complete reversibility, but failing to do so can lead to severe toxicity or even death. Patient selection is an indirect way to reduce adverse events minimizing the number of subjects exposed to this drugs: unfortunately PDL-1, the actual predictive biomarker, would not allow clinicians select or exclude patients for treatment with checkpoint inhibitors."

The pivotal trials consistently showed a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients with driver mutation-negative NSCLC, a field in which outcomes had been stagnant for decades. The success of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in NSCLC has led to enthusiasm to expand the reach of these drugs into other thoracic malignancies such as thymic epithelial tumors (TETs), mesothelioma, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Unfortunately, the improvement in outcomes with ICI therapy in these rarer thoracic tumors has been somewhat modest, and in the case of thymoma, rates of adverse events are too high to routinely justify their use. Although the response rates seen in ICI therapy in these tumor types are similar to those seen with other available single-agent therapies for advanced disease, ICIs do present another option for clinicians treating patients with mesothelioma, small cell carcinoma, and thymic carcinoma (TC), diseases in which approved treatment options are limited. Here we review the latest trials of ICI therapy in mesothelioma, SCLC, and TETs."

Expression of PD-L1 has demonstrated utility in selecting patients for response to ICB and has proven to be an important biomarker for patient selection. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is emerging as a potential biomarker. However, refinement of interpretation and contextualization is required. Materials and methods: In this review, we outline the evolution of TMB as a biomarker in oncology, delineate how TMB can be applied in the clinic, discuss current limitations as a diagnostic test, and highlight mechanistic insights unveiled by the study of TMB. We review available data to date studying TMB as a biomarker for response to ICB by tumor type, focusing on studies proposing a threshold for TMB as a predictive biomarker for ICB activity. Results: High TMB consistently selects for benefit with ICB therapy. In lung, bladder and head and neck cancers, the current predictive TMB thresholds proposed approximate 200 non-synonymous somatic mutations by whole exome sequencing (WES). PD-L1 expression influences response to ICB in high TMB tumors with single agent PD-(L)1 antibodies; however, response may not be dependent on PD-L1 expression in the setting of anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination therapy. Disease-specific TMB thresholds for effective prediction of response in various other malignancies are not well established. Conclusions: TMB, in concert with PD-L1 expression, has been demonstrated to be a useful biomarker for ICB selection across some cancer types; however, further prospective validation studies are required. TMB determination by selected targeted panels has been correlated with WES. Calibration and harmonization will be required for optimal utility and alignment across all platforms currently used internationally. Key challenges will need to be addressed before broader use in different tumor types."

To further improve overall outcomes, positron emission tomography-driven strategies and ABVD or BEACOPP variants incorporating the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (BV) or anti-PD1 antibodies are under investigation in advanced-stage patients. The present study aimed to elicit preferences for attributes associated with ABVD, BEACOPPescalated and BV-AVD (BV, adriamycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) among patients and physicians. Cross-sectional online discrete choice experiments were administered to HL patients (n = 381) and haematologists/oncologists (n = 357) in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Included attributes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the risk of neuropathy, lung damage, infertility and hospitalisation due to adverse events. Whereas 5-year PFS and OS were the most important treatment attributes to patients, the relative importance of each attribute and preference weights for each level varied among physicians according to the description of the hypothetical patient for whom treatment was recommended. PFS and OS most strongly influenced physicians recommendations when considering young female patients who did not want children or young male patients. Infertility was more important to physicians treatment decision than PFS when considering young women with unknown fertility preferences, whereas hospitalisations due to adverse events played the largest role in treatment decisions for older patients.© 2018 The Authors.

Given that the recognition by T cells of tumor antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules is essential for an antitumor immune response, we examined the effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on MHC-I expression in NSCLC cell lines. Appropriate EGFR-TKIs increased MHC-I expression at the mRNA and cell surface protein levels in NSCLC cells positive for EGFR mutations including those with the T790M secondary mutation. Trametinib, an inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase MEK, also increased MHC-I expression, whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor buparlisib did not, suggesting that the MEK-ERK pathway mediates the down-regulation of MHC-I expression in response to EGFR activation. Immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR-mutated NSCLC specimens obtained before and after EGFR-TKI treatment also revealed down-regulation of phosphorylated forms of EGFR and ERK in association with up-regulation of MHC-I, an increased number of infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and increased PD-1 ligand 1 expression after such treatment. Our results thus suggest that mutational activation of EGFR inhibits MHC-I expression through the MEK-ERK pathway in NSCLC and thereby contributes to the poor response of such tumors to immunotherapy. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the relation between EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling in and the immune response to EGFR-mutated NSCLC. .© 2018 The Authors.

Targeted therapies based on molecular tumor features and programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) blockade immunotherapy have offered new therapeutic options for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-pathway promotes tumor growth and progression, including angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and inhibition of apoptosis, providing a strong rationale for targeting this pathway. EGFR expression is detected in up to 85% of NSCLC and has been demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis. Two approaches for blocking EGFR signaling are available: prevention of ligand binding to the extracellular domain with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity with small molecules. There is a strong rationale to consider the tumors level of EGFR expression as one of the most significant predictive biomarkers in this setting. In this paper we provide an update focusing on the current status of EGFR-directed mAbs use for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC, through a review of all clinical trials involving anti-EGFR mAbs in combination with chemotherapy (CT) for advanced disease and with chemo-radiotherapy for stage III disease. Here we also discuss the current status of predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR mAbs when added to first-line CT in patients with advanced NSCLC. Finally, we focused on the relevance of EGFR fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)+ and immunohistochemistry (IHC)-Score ≥ 200 as predictive biomarkers for the selection of patients who would be most likely to derive a clinical benefit from treatment with CT in combination with anti-EGFR mAbs, with particular reference also to histology."

However, there were some differences in efficacy and response predictors for anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies between squamous (SQ) and nonsquamous (non-SQ) NSCLC. The study aims to elucidate the possible difference in immune microenvironment between SQ-NSCLC and non-SQ-NSCLC and their influence on the prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 197 patients with stages I to III NSCLC were included. cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression were examined in cancer nest and stroma on 85 SQ-NSCLC and 112 non-SQ-NSCLC samples using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: More CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were detected in the cancer nests (cCD8) from patients with SQ-NSCLC than those with non-SQ-NSCLC (56% vs. 34%; P = .002). There were no significant differences between the SQ and non-SQ groups in terms of other TIL markers or PD-L1 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that the degree of cCD8+ TIL infiltration was an independent positive predictor for overall survival (OS) in the SQ-NSCLC group (P = .003) and in the non-SQ-NSCLC group (P = .024). In the univariate analysis, CD8+ TILs in the stroma, CD4+ TILs in the cancer nest and stroma, and FOXP3+ TILs in the cancer stroma associated with different prognoses for patients with either non-SQ-NSCLC or SQ-NSCLC. Using a 10% cutoff, PD-L1 expression was a poor prognostic factor in total NSCLC (P = .011), stage I (P = .037), SQ-NSCLC (P = .097), and non-SQ-NSCLC (P = .051). CONCLUSION: The different cCD8+ TIL profile and different prognostic value with certain TILs indicates that SQ-NSCLC and non-SQ-NSCLC are likely different cancer types with respect to their immune microenvironments."

We evaluated the correlation between immune-related adverse events (irAE) and treatment interruption due to irAE on clinical efficacy of PD-1 Ab in advanced NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Advanced NSCLC patients treated with PD-1 Ab between June 2015 to November 2017 at BC Cancer were identified. Demographic, tumor, treatment details, and frequency and grade (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) of irAE were abstracted from chart review. Kaplan-Meier curves of OS from initiation of PD-1 Ab were generated. Multivariable analysis with 6- and 12-week landmark analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: In a cohort of 271 patients, irAEs were observed in 116 patients (42.8%). Nivolumab recipients developing colitis had lower OS compared to those who did not at the 6-week landmark (P = .010) and 12-week landmark (P = .072). For the entire cohort, 56 patients (20.7%) needed treatment interruption because of an irAE. Treatment interruption correlated with lower OS at the 6-week landmark (P = .005) and 12-week landmark (P = .008). Six-week landmark multivariable analysis identified Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 3 or higher, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 2 or higher, presence of liver metastases, and irAE greater than grade 2 versus no irAE to be associated with decreased OS (each P < .05). CONCLUSION: Treatment interruption due to irAE was associated with a lower median OS compared to continuous PD-1 Ab therapy. Shorter OS seen with severe irAE might reflect the need for improved physician education in irAE treatment algorithms."

The novel immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) presents as the therapeutic Holly Grail in lung cancer treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Preclinical models provide evidence of immunotherapy-radiotherapy (IM-RT) synergy. The exposure to ionizing radiation turns tumor in an in-situ vaccine, primes the innate immune system, increases immunotherapy efficacy by overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of immune-resistant tumors and promotes a systemic, out-of-field antitumor T-cell-mediated response called abscopal effect. The immunomodulatory and abscopal effects of radiotherapy can be further enhanced by combining with systemic immunotherapies. The phase III START trial proved that liposomal vaccine - tecemotide (L-BLP25) administered as maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in LA-NSCLC prolongs survival. In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. SUMMARY: PACIFIC trial results are expected to definitely establish durvalumab as standard consolidation strategy in LA-NSCLC. Many clinical trials are ongoing in the field of immunoradiotherapy in LA-NSCLC to define the optimal conditions for this therapeutic combination."

All patients without adequate clinical or radiologic follow-up data in the electronic medical records were excluded. Imaging examinations for all patients deemed by their thoracic oncologists to have radiologic pseudoprogression or therapy-associated pneumonitis were reviewed by experienced thoracic radiologists. RESULTS: A total of 166 patients with NSCLC had available clinical and imaging data for retrospective review. Of these patients, 4 (2%) were considered to have radiologic pseudoprogression, 3 of which manifested as increased tumor size and 1 of which manifested with new lesions.

For patients with chemorefractory gastroesophageal cancer, treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy results in modest benefits in overall survival; nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been licenced in Japan and the USA, respectively, for this indication. However, initial enthusiasm has been tempered by the results of several large negative trials; immune checkpoint blockade is not superior to chemotherapy in the second-line setting or beyond in unselected or low PD-L1-expressing patients. Microsatellite instability is uncommon in patients with metastatic gastric cancer; however, it is associated with response rates of more than 50% and long-term survival benefit. Combining anti-PD-1 with cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies also shows promise to extend the benefit of immune checkpoint blockade to a larger proportion of gastroesophageal cancer patients.

It has been shown to significantly improve survival in several types of cancer, but clinical trials have also reported an increased risk of developing immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). Endocrine IRAEs may be particularly relevant. OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively evaluate the clinical presentation of endocrine IRAEs in patients with lung cancer treated with nivolumab. Potential risk factors are analyzed, and strategies for IRAE management are proposed. METHODS: Forty consecutive patients treated with nivolumab for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were studied, paying particular attention to development of endocrine IRAEs (thyroid, hypophyseal, adrenal, or pancreatic) and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Thyroid function changes were found in 9 patients (22.5%), of which six developed hypothyroidism and three had hyperthyroidism after a median of 3.8 and 2.3 cycles of nivolumab respectively. Only one patient had thyroid-related symptoms. Thyroid autoimmunity was negative in all cases. Hyperthyroid patients showed no uptake in iodine scintigraphy, and their hormone values returned to normal in less than six months. Nivolumab was discontinued for toxicity in one patient. One patient with hyperthyroidism also developed autoimmune diabetes, and one patient with hypothyroidism also had hypogonadism. After a median follow-up of 7.6 months, 25 patients (62.5%) showed response to nivolumab. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no differences between patients who developed thyroid changes and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid changes after treatment with nivolumab are common and warrant active laboratory monitoring. The underlying mechanisms and their relevance deserve further research."

We investigated whether human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes predispose to developing of irAEs during therapy and thus hold a predictive role. METHODS: We established a prospective observational single-centre study and collected data from patients with either metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic melanoma, who were treated with anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death receptor 1), anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) or both CIs combined. Data include irAEs and ranges from 15th July 2016 until 10th May 2018. In addition, we performed HLA typing via next generation sequencing. RESULTS: We enrolled 102 patients (median [range] age, 68 [62-74] years) with metastatic cancer in our study who received CI therapy. Of these patients, 59 (58%) developed one or more irAEs, among which pruritus (n = 32 (54%)) and rash (n = 24 (41%)) had the highest rates. We did not find evidence for a single HLA gene being associated with all irAEs (all P > .05). When assessing each irAE individually, we found a significant association between HLA-DRB1*11:01 and pruritus (OR = 4.53, X21,95 = 9.45, P < .01) as well as a nominally significant additive association between HLA-DQB1*03:01 and colitis (OR = 3.94, X21,95 = 5.67, P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of two HLA alleles that are known to predispose to autoimmune diseases were associated with the development of pruritus or colitis during therapy, suggesting a genetic aetiology of irAEs. Larger genome-wide association studies should be performed to confirm our findings."

Programed death ligand 1 PD-L1, expressed on cancer cell membranes also blocks the cytotoxic activity of PD1+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. Materials and Methods: We assessed the immunohistochemical detection of these immune-tolerance related markers in a series of 98 non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) treated with surgery. The Tumor Infiltration Lymphocyte TIL density (mean number per x400 optical field) and the percentage of FOXP3+ TILs were assessed. Results: PD-L1 expression was directly linked with the TIL density (p = 0.01) and with the extent of infiltration with FOXP3+ TILs, named as the FIL-score (p = 0.01). FIL-score was significantly higher in stage I disease (p = 0.04). IL6 expression was linked with high TIL-score. A low TIL-score, characterizing immune deficient tumors defined a significantly poorer prognosis subgroup of patients (p = 0.03). Stratification of these tumors according to the FIL-score showed that FOXP3 expression by TILs correlated with an even a poorer prognosis in univariate (p = 0.007; median survival 14 vs. 44 months, respectively) and in multivariate analysis (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 4.3). Conclusion: Tumor stroma infiltration by FOXP3+ Tregs is an early event in the progression of NSCLC. Low lymphocytic infiltration defines poor prognosis, which becomes worse when the small numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes characterizing these tumors contain FOXP3 + Tregs. Furthermore, the direct association of FOXP3+ Treg infiltration density with PD-L1 expression by cancer cells implies a co-ordinated immune-suppressive activity in NSCLC."

Nab-paclitaxel was developed to reduce the toxicities associated with solvent-bound paclitaxel (sb-paclitaxel). Areas covered: This review first focuses on the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of nab-paclitaxel in NSCLC at different settings. The approval of nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin at the front-line setting for advanced NSCLC was based on the key phase III study, which showed that nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin was associated with superior overall response rate and favorable toxicity profile compared to sb-paclitaxel/carboplatin. The review also addresses the nab-paclitaxel pharmacology, other combinations (e.g. immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), potential biomarkers (e.g. caveolin-1), and special subgroups (e.g. the elderly, squamous histology). Expert opinion: Existing data has established the role of nab-paclitaxel in the management of advanced NSCLC. Emerging evidence, such as preliminary results from Keynote-407 and IMpower 131 studies, indicates that novel combinations of nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors could further improve clinical benefits with manageable toxicity. Nevertheless, in order to better position nab-paclitaxel and to improve patient selection, future studies are warranted to further understand its mechanism of action, predictive biomarkers, and potential synergism with other agents."

When surgical and radiation options have been exhausted, the effectiveness of systemic chemotherapy is poor. No biologic or targeted agents have been approved for the management of advanced or recurrent vulvar cancer. Pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 (PD-1), has been successfully used as a target of tumor immune therapy in small cell lung cancer and melanoma. We present the first case in the literature of a patient with recurrent vulvar cancer who was treated successfully with pembrolizumab. Caris next-generation testing revealed a PD-L1 and PD-1 mutation (PD-L1 positive, 2+, 100%). She attained a complete clinical remission after 2 cycles, and a CT scan after 6 cycles revealed a significant response by RECIST criteria. After completing 10 cycles, treatment was stopped due to complications of severe malnutrition related to narcotic abuse. A CT scan 10 weeks after the final treatment revealed no adenopathy. Pembrolizumab is a safe and effective chemotherapeutic agent to treat recurrent vulvar carcinoma.© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel."

The aim of our study is to assess the analytical performance of laboratory-developed tests for Ventana SP263 and Agilent/Dako 22C3, and to investigate the association between PD-L1 assays and response to PD-1/L1 inhibitors. METHODS AND RESULTS: PD-L1 SP263 and 22C3 assays were performed on 302 consecutive non-small-cell lung carcinoma samples Both assays were optimised for use on the automated Ventana BenchMark Ultra platform. Scoring algorithms for staining of the tumour cells using the established cut-offs were applied to all samples. Best overall response (BOR) for 44 patients treated with either nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab were assessed using recist version 1.1 and correlated with PD-L1 assay results. Assays showed good agreement, with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-0.90)]. Comparing the assays using cut-offs of 1%, 5%, 10%, 1-49% and ≥50% showed an association between the two assays (P < 0.0001). The SP263 10% cut-off (P = 0.032) was associated with BOR, whereas the 1% (P = 0.087) and 5% (P = 0.051) cut-offs were not. In contrast 22C3, cut-offs of 1% (P = 0.019), 5% (P = 0.025) and 10% (P = 0.014) were all associated with BOR. CONCLUSIONS: The SP263 and 22C3 LDTs demonstrated good analytical concordance, and correlation with response to PD-1/L1 inhibitors.© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

But complete and long-lasting efficacy is only observed in a fraction of the patient population. One of the suspected causes is the inability of cytotoxic T cells, endowed with tumor killing ability, to reach their malignant targets. Using dynamic fluorescence imaging to study the dynamic of T cells in tumors from patients with lung cancer, we have recently demonstrated that macrophages trap the T lymphocytes, which are not longer able to contact the tumor cells. In murine models of breast cancer, we could show that the depletion of macrophages allows T cells to interact with tumor cells, a process which enhances anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings illustrate the relevance of current clinical trials combining a strategy that deplete or modulate macrophages with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy."

Herein we describe pharmacological studies in mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and in human primary cells which support the development of DV281, a C-class CpG-ODN, as an inhaled aerosolized immunotherapeutic for lung cancer to be combined with an inhibitor of the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‑1) immune checkpoint. In vitro, DV281 potently induced Interferon (IFN)‑α from monkey and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), stimulated interleukin‑6 production and proliferation in human B cells, and induced TLR9-dependent cytokine responses from mouse splenocytes. Intranasal delivery of DV281 to mice led to substantial but transient cytokine and chemokine responses in the lung. Lung responses to repeated intranasal DV281 were partially to fully reversible 2 weeks after the final dose and were absent in TLR9-deficient mice. Single escalating doses of aerosolized DV281 in monkeys induced dose-dependent induction of IFN-regulated genes in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and blood. In a repeat-dose safety study in monkeys, inhaled DV281 was well-tolerated, and findings were mechanism of action-related and non-adverse. Co-culture of human PBMC with DV281 and anti-PD‑1 antibody did not augment cytokine or cellular proliferation responses compared to DV281 alone, indicating that the combination did not lead to dysregulated cytokine responses. These studies support clinical development of inhaled aerosolized DV281 as a combination therapy with anti-PD‑1 antibody for lung cancer immunotherapy."

Different therapeutic strategies for ovarian carcinoma have evolved over the years. Already 30 years ago, the first clinical studies focused on modulating the tumor cytokine network with special attention to interferon-mediated immune responses. With the exploration of specific tumor antigens such as NY-ESO-1, which is expressed in ovarian carcinoma and other malignancies, the development of therapeutic cancer vaccines has been pursued initiating the era of personalized anti-cancer medicine. Almost at the same time, the adoptive transfer of genetically modified autologous tumor-reactive T-cells occurred, but response rates in ovarian carcinoma were disappointing. Today, probably the most promising therapeutic approach in this context is the blockade of immune checkpoints, such as programed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and one of its ligands (PD-L1) or cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which has demonstrated impressive response rates in malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Despite increasing availability of treatment approaches that target tumor immune surveillance in ovarian carcinoma, selecting patient groups that particularly benefit from these treatment modalities is clinically challenging as predictive biomarkers are lacking. Here, we summarize different immunotherapy approaches in ovarian cancer and discuss why immunotherapy in ovarian cancer is still in its infancy.© IGCS and ESGO 2019. No commercial re-use.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect the expressions of MALAT1, miR-200a-3p and PD-L1 in NSCLC tissues and cells for the correlation analysis. The starBase and Targetscan databases were used to predict the binding sites between MALAT1 and miR-200a-3p, and miR-200a-3p and PD-L1, respectively. The targeting relationship between MALAT1 and miR-200a-3p, and miR-200a-3p and PD-L1 were further verified by real-time PCR and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Cell proliferation was monitored by CCK8 and colony formation assays. The apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry. Wound healing assay and transwell assay were conducted to determine cell migration and invasion. In this study, we demonstrated that in NSCLC tissues, the expression level of MALAT1 was negatively correlated with that of miR-200a-3p, while positively correlated with PD-L1. Besides, MALAT1 promoted proliferation, mobility, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells via sponging miR-200a-3p. PD-L1 was validated as a target of miR-200a-3p, and indirectly modulated by MALAT1. In conclusion, LncRNA MALAT1 facilitates the progression of NSCLC by modulating miR-200a-3p/PDL1 axis."

Herein, we collected peripheral blood from 20 healthy donors and 50 patients with advanced NSCLC, before and after chemotherapy, followed by phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets and assessment of the correlation between their post-chemotherapy levels and progression-free survival (PFS). Results showed that, before chemotherapy, the levels of CD8+ lymphocytes, PD-1+CD4+, Th2, and Th17 cells were elevated in patients peripheral blood, in contrast to natural killer (NK) cells and Th1 cells. Besides, there was no remarkable difference in the frequency of PD-1+CD8+ cells between patients and healthy controls. After chemotherapy, the levels of CD8+ lymphocytes, NK, Th2, Th17, and Treg were declined, in contrast to the level of Th1 cells which was markedly increased. Importantly, chemotherapy had no impact on the frequencies of PD-1+CD8+ and PD-1+CD4+ cells. PFS was significantly better in patients with low percentage of PD-1+CD4+ T cells than those with high percentage. Patients with high content of Th1 cells showed longer PFS than those with low content. The low percentages of Th17 and Treg cells were correlated with longer PFS, even though the difference did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, the imbalance of lymphocyte subsets is a hallmark of NSCLC. Furthermore, the high level of PD-1+CD4+ cells plays a crucial role in the progression of NSCLC and could be used as a prognostic marker; and the high level of Th1 could predict better clinical outcomes of chemotherapy."

It is unknown whether palliative RT leads to lymphopenia in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and whether this affects outcomes. As such, we sought to assess the impact of palliative RT on circulating lymphocyte count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients being treated with PD-1-directed ICI and associations with survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified patients from 5 radiation oncology centers, treated with palliative RT and either pembrolizumab or nivolumab with non-small cell lung cancer, metastatic melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Patients who received intervening cytotoxic chemotherapy were excluded. We recorded absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio before and after palliative RT and at the start of ICI. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients received 225 courses of palliative RT. Median change in ALC after RT was -161 cells/mL. Decreases in ALC were greater with RT to the spine, lung/mediastinum, and chest wall compared with the brain, extremity, or abdomen/pelvis (P = .002) and after courses >5 fractions (P = .003). Extracranial and >5-fraction RT was associated with increased odds of severe lymphopenia (ALC <500) at the end of RT (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; P = .001; and OR, 3.9; P = .001, respectively). Patients who developed RT-induced severe lymphopenia were more likely to have severe lymphopenia when ICI was initiated (OR, 6.4; P = .0001), particularly when RT was administered in the previous 3 months (OR, 189; P < .0001). Severe lymphopenia at onset of ICI therapy was associated with increased mortality on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.1; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Extracranial or prolonged courses of RT increase the risk of severe lymphopenia, which is associated with poorer survival in patients treated with ICI."

Increasing understanding of the molecular changes that drive tumor progression has transformed the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless, various countries differ in the degree of implementation of genetic tests and the availability of innovative drugs. The LungCARD consortium created a questionnaire to collect information about the local research and clinical practices related to lung cancer diagnosis and therapy. METHODS: A survey composed of 37 questions related to specific lung cancer pharmacogenomics and therapy, was distributed among 18 countries. RESULTS: All together 36 responses were gathered, answered mainly by clinicians. The majority attends 50-200 cancer cases per month, 20-50% of all cancer cases are lung cancer patients, and more than 80% are with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapy is applied to 50% on average of all NSCLC patients. Forty five percent of participating medical oncologists are treating their patients with immunotherapy. More than 90% of the respondents are guided by results of genetic tests in introducing targeted treatment. As expected, the majority orders EGFR gene testing (85%), followed by ALK (58%) and KRAS testing (32%). Almost all (96%) agreed that more biomarkers should be included in routine genetic testing (ROS1, anti-PDL1, KRAS, MET, HER2, BRAF...), and that blood test is useful in pharmacogenomic testing. CONCLUSION: There is a great variation between countries with respect to all discussed topics. However, the majority recognized a necessity of introducing next generation sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics and potential of testing from blood. The biggest problem in the treatment of NSCLC is still an access to innovative drugs."

Materials and Methods: 1016 NSCLC mRNA-sequence samples from The Genome Data Analysis Center (TCGA) and 275 NSCLC mRNA-microarray samples from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were included as testing cohort and validation cohort respectively. Enrichment scores of CD8+ T cells metagene were used for quantifying its infiltrating density. Based on the median values of CD8+ T cell density and PD-1/PD-L1 mRNA expression, the samples were classified into four Tumor Immune Microenvironment types (TIMTs). Overall survival, as well as clinicopathological features, mutational profiles, mismatch repair score etc. were compared across the four types. Results: Neither PD-1 expression nor PD-L1 expression was associated with outcome in the overall NSCLC. Classification of TIMT based on PD-1/PD-L1 and CD8+ TIL could efficiently classify patients of different survival in ADC but not SCC, with the best overall survival achieved in TIMT3 (high CD8+ TIL and low PD-1/PD-L1), whereas TIMT2 (low CD8+ TIL and high PD-1/PD-L1) manifested the worst outcome. TIMT classification based on PD-1/ CD8+ TIL could better stratify patient of different prognosis than PD-L1/ CD8+ TIL based classification. EGFR wide type and IFNγ overexpression were associated with TIMT4 (high PD-1/PD-L1 and high CD8+ TIL), whereas tumor mutational burden (TMB) manifested no significant difference across four TIMTs. Conclusion: The classification of tumors into four microenvironment subtypes based on PD-1/PD-L1 status and CD8+ TIL is an appropriate approach to stratify patients of different clinical outcome and better guide the practical use of immunotherapy."

This work aimed to determine the predictive ability of FUT4 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) after curative resection, as well as to explore the role of a possible FUT4 molecular mechanism on LUAD malignant behavior. METHODS: A total of 273 LUAD patients after curative resection with complete clinicopathological and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort were collected. Correlation of FUT4 with overall survival (OS) was analyzed based on TCGA and further validated by online "Kaplan-Meier Plotter" database and IHC in 70 LUAD patients recruited in the First Hospital of China Medical University cohort. Multivariate Cox regression analysis and 1000 bootstrapping were performed to verify the predictive value of FUT4. Gene set enrichment assay (GSEA) was performed to investigate the biological characteristics. Correlation between PD-1 and FUT4 was analyzed based on TCGA cohort and validated by IHC on cohort from our hospital. RESULTS: Increased FUT4 expression led to reduced overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients based on TCGA (p = 0.006 and 0.001 for dichotomous and trichotomous modeling, respectively) and externally validated in KMPLOTTER (p = 0.01) and by IHC based on cohort from our hospital (p = 0.005 and p = 0.019 for dichotomous and trichotomous modeling, respectively). FUT4 overexpression was an independent high risk factor for OS along with advanced pT stage and pTNM stage (p = 0.001, p = 0.037, and p < 0.001, respectively). GSEA revealed that FUT4 overexpression might correlate with shortened survival of LUAD patients by promoting cell proliferation via ERBB signaling, and suppressing immune response-related pathways. FUT4 expression positively correlated with PD-1 in TCGA (p = 0.026) and validated by IHC on cohort from our hospital (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Increased FUT4 expression led to reduced OS in operable LUAD. FUT4 showed significant correlation with immune response and PD-1 expression."

Although CTLA4 expression was found in multiple tumours including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cells, its function in tumour cells is unknown. Recently, PD-1 was found to be expressed in melanoma cells and to promote tumorigenesis. We found that CTLA4 was expressed in a subset of NSCLC cell lines and in a subgroup of cancer cells within the lung cancer tissues. We further found that in NSCLC cells, anti-CTLA4 antibody can induce PD-L1 expression, which is mediated by CTLA4 and the EGFR pathway involving phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. In CTLA4 knockout cells, EGFR knockout cells or in the presence of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, anti-CTLA4 antibody was not able to induce PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. Moreover, anti-CTLA4 antibody promoted NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro and tumour growth in vivo in the absence of adaptive immunity. These results suggest that tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4 can regulate PD-L1 expression and cell proliferation, and that anti-CTLA4 antibody, by binding to the tumour cell-intrinsic CTLA4, may result in the activation of the EGFR pathway in cancer cells.© 2018 The Authors.

We report a 72-year-old patient with lung cancer with pathologically proven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis who was treated with nivolumab. She demonstrated pneumonitis with an organized pneumonia (OP) pattern, but no acute exacerbation of ILD featuring a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) pattern. She was successfully treated with corticosteroid therapy, and maintained good disease control after the discontinuation of nivolumab. She also showed pseudoprogression of the primary tumor, implying infiltration of T-cells into the lung.

The prescription of pembrolizumab has been approved by FDA and EMA for advanced stages non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), restricted for first-line setting to patients whose tumor presents ≥50% of PD-L1 positive tumor cells (TC), and ≥1% for second-line and beyond, leading to consider PD-L1 assay as a companion diagnostic tool for pembrolizumab. Very recently, the EMA has approved durvalumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC not progressing after chemoradiotherapy and whose tumors express PD-L1 on ≥1% of TC. Four standardized PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assays have been used in clinical trials; 22C3 and 28-8 PharmDx assays on Dako/Agilent platforms, and SP142 and SP263 assays on Ventana platforms, each test having been developed initially for a specific ICI. They differ in terms of primary monoclonal antibody, platform, detection system and scoring methods with different thresholds of positivity validated in clinical trials. Several studies have shown a close analytical performance of the 22C3, 28-8 and SP263 assays regarding TC staining in NSCLC, with poor concordance with SP142 assay and for immune cells. However, as dedicated platforms are not available in all pathology laboratories and because of the high cost of these assays, laboratory developed tests are widely used in many countries. Their validation must guarantee the same sensitivities and specificities as compared to standardized assays. Overall, PD-L1 test is of great help to select patients who could benefit for ICI and most pathologists have included this test in their daily practice for advanced stages NSCLC, besides ALK and ROS1 IHC."

However, despite the significant survival benefit for some patients with advanced NSCLC, the objective response rates (ORRs) remain relatively low no more than 20-30% with a large proportion of patients demonstrating primary resistance. Although the selection of NSCLC patients for the first-line treatment is currently guided by the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells as detected by immunohistochemistry, this is not the case for the second-line setting. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of PD-L1 expression is modest which has prompted the search for additional predictive biomarkers. In this context, the assessment of the tumor mutational burden (TMB), defined as the total number of nonsynonymous mutations in the coding regions of genes, has recently emerged as an additional powerful biomarker to select patients for immunotherapy.

Because side effects may be life threatening and treatment costs remain very high, the identification of predictive markers is mandatory and actually extensively studied. Factors that determine response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are numerous including tumor microenvironment, immune tumor infiltrates, expression of immune checkpoint proteins (PD-1/PD-L1), gene expression signatures and molecular tumor profiles. Based on high impact factor publications and recent literature this review focuses on the potential predictive value of tumor molecular alterations and tumor mutation burden as predictive markers of response or resistance to ICI. We also discuss the role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor ICI responses and propose an algorithm that integrates molecular markers upcoming recommendations for first line treatment."

Recently, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade also has demonstrated interesting results in small trials of neoadjuvant treatment in stage IB to IIIA NSCLC. In addition, several clinical trials using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment in patients with resectable stage NSCLC are ongoing. However, few analyses of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy-related biomarkers in early-stage squamous cell lung carcinoma (SqCLC) have been reported. In this study, we evaluated PD-L1 protein expression, tumor mutation burden, and expression of an immune gene signature in early-stage SqCLC, providing data for identifying the potential role for patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in early-stage SqCLC. METHODS: A total of 255 specimens from patients with early-stage SqCLC were identified within participating centers of the Strategic Partnering to Evaluate Cancer Signatures program. PD-L1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry was evaluated by using the Dako PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx kit on the Dako Link 48 auto-stainer (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was calculated on the basis of data from targeted genome sequencing. The T-effector and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene signature was determined from Affymetrix gene chip data (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) from frozen specimens. RESULTS: The prevalence of PD-L1 expression was 9.8% at a tumor proportion score cutoff of at least 50%. PD-L1 mRNA and programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 mRNA positively correlated with PD-L1 protein expression on tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 protein expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells was correlated with the T-effector and IFN-γ gene signature (p < 0.001), but not with TMB. For TCs, all of these biomarkers were independent of each other and neither PD-L1 protein expression, TMB, or T-effector and IFN-γ gene signatures were independently prognostic for patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of PD-L1 expression, TMB, and T-effector and IFN-γ gene signatures in the cohort with early-stage SqCLC found them to be independent of each other, and none was associated with overall survival. Our results also support the hypothesis that PD-L1 expression is regulated by an intrinsic mechanism on TCs and an adaptive mechanism on immune cells."

Epub 2018 Sep 3.","Current status of immune checkpoint inhibitors in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.","Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, including in Korea. Systemic therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy should be provided to patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Applications of targeted therapy, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, in patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement has enabled dramatic improvements in efficacy and tolerability. Despite advances in research and a better understanding of the molecular pathways of NSCLC, few effective therapeutic options are available for most patients with NSCLC without druggable targets, especially for patients with squamous cell NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 or anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have demonstrated durable response rates across a broad range of solid tumors, including NSCLC, which has revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors. Here, we review the current status and future approaches of immune checkpoint inhibitors that are being investigated for NSCLC with a focus on pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab."

Epub 2018 Dec 4.","Haematological immune-related adverse events induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy: a descriptive observational study.","BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies are novel immunotherapies for cancer that can induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These adverse events can involve all organs, including the haemopoietic system. Thus far, haematological irAEs (haem-irAEs) have not been extensively characterised. This study aims to provide a comprehensive report of the haem-irAEs induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. METHODS: In this descriptive observational study, we included consecutive patients aged at least 18 years with grade 2 or worse haem-irAEs induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy registered in three French pharmacovigilance databases: the Registre des Effets Indésirables Sévères des Anticorps Monoclonaux Immunomodulateurs en Cancérologie (REISAMIC; a prospective registry of patients treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 at a single centre), the ImmunoTOX committee of Gustave Roussy (a national referral database of suspected irAEs in patients treated with immunotherapy), and the registry of the Centre de Référence des Cytopénies Auto-Immunes de lAdulte (CeReCAI; a national database of autoimmune cytopenias). Cases were reviewed by a central committee; adverse events had to be classed as certainly or probably related to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy, and their severity was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). The primary endpoint was clinical description of haem-irAEs, as reported in all databases, and their frequency, as reported in the prospective REISAMIC registry. FINDINGS: We screened 948 patients registered in the three databases from June 27, 2014, to June 29, 2018 (745 from REISAMIC, 190 from the ImmunoTOX committee, and 13 from CeReCAI). 35 patients (21 men and 14 women) with haem-irAEs related to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 were included in the study. Of 745 patients in the REISAMIC registry treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, four had haem-irAEs, giving a frequency of 0·5%. Median age in the 35 patients was 65 years (IQR 51-75), and the most common tumour types were melanoma (15 [43%] patients), non-small-cell lung cancer (12 [34%] patients), and lymphoma (four [11%] patients). 20 (57%) patients received nivolumab, 14 (40%) received pembrolizumab, and one (3%) received atezolizumab. Among the 35 patients, neutropenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and immune thrombocytopenia were the most common types of haem-irAE (each in nine patients [26%]), followed by pancytopenia or aplastic anaemia (five patients [14%]), bicytopenia (one patients with thrombocytopenia plus anaemia and one patient with neutropenia plus anaemia [6%]), and pure red cell aplasia (one patient [3%]). The maximum grade of severity was grade 2 in three (9%) patients, grade 3 in five (14%) patients, and grade 4 in 25 (71%) patients; two (6%) patients died from febrile neutropenia during haem-irAE related to anti-PD-1. Haem-irAEs resolved in 21 (60%) of the 35 patients. INTERPRETATION: Haem-irAEs induced by PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors are rare but potentially life-threatening events. The most common clinical presentations are neutropenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anaemia. Investigations into earlier detection and better management are warranted. FUNDING: Gustave Roussy and Gustave Roussy Immunotherapy Program."

It has remained unclear, however, whether cytotoxic chemotherapy affects the immune microenvironment in NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated changes in programmed cell death 1-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density in NSCLC patients who underwent rebiopsy at the site of recurrence after postoperative platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, or in those who underwent rebiopsy after one or more chemotherapeutic regimens at the advanced stage. The PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) and CD8+ TIL density were determined by immunohistochemistry. TMB was estimated by next-generation sequencing with a cancer gene panel (409 genes). RESULTS: Seventeen patients with NSCLC wild type for EGFR and ALK were enrolled. Although PD-L1 TPS tended to be increased in rebiopsy samples compared with initial biopsy tissue, this difference was not significant (P =  0.113). Seven patients showed an increase in PD-L1 TPS, with this change being pronounced in four. Two cases in which PD-L1 TPS increased from 0 to 90% or from 0 to 95% after cytotoxic chemotherapy also showed a durable response to subsequent treatment with an ICI. No substantial correlation between PD-L1 TPS and TMB was apparent either before (R = 0.112) or after (R = 0.101) chemotherapy. A moderate correlation was detected between PD-L1 TPS and CD8+ TIL density before chemotherapy (R = 0.517) and a negligible correlation after (R = 0.0219). CONCLUSION: Cytotoxic chemotherapy may change the biological characteristics of tumors including PD-L1 expression level and TMB."

METHODS: Flow Cytometry of peripheral blood (PB) CD3+, CD8+, CD4+, NK, Treg and MDSCs was prospectively performed in 31 consecutive advanced NSCLC patients at baseline (T0) and after 2 (T1) and 4 (T2) cycles of bi-weekly nivolumab. Functional molecules (PD-1, CD3ζ, Granzyme B, Perforin), cell proliferation (Ki67) and NK receptors (NKG2 A, NKG2D, NKp30) were also explored. The immunohistochemical evaluation of PD-L1 and TILs was restricted to available tumor biopsies. Tissue and circulating parameters were correlated to clinico-pathological features and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: KRAS mutations, active smoking, COPD and steroid treatment conditioned a different distribution of circulating phenotypes. At baseline, clinical benefit (CB, n = 19) group displayed higher number of phenotypically active NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells (p < 0.01) compared to non-responders (NR, n = 12). Prolonged survival outcomes (p < 0.01) were recorded in cases with high baseline circulating NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells. At tissue level, low PD-1 expression in CD8 + TILs was a positive prognostic feature (p < 0.001). Strikingly, high circulating NK and PD-1+CD8+ cells combined with low PD-1/CD8+ ratio in TILs characterized a privileged context able to provide a significantly prolonged (p < 0.01) progression-free survival (PFS). During PD-1 blockade, NKs progressively raised in CB while declined in NR (p < 0.05) and this phenomenon was counterbalanced by parallel changes in Treg. CONCLUSION: The functional pool of circulating NKs associated with a divergent PD-1 expression in blood and tissue CD8+ lymphocytes portrays an immune profile predictive of anti-PD1 treatment efficacy."

In this era of cancer immunotherapy, humanized mouse models which recapitulate human immune system, are needed for predicting immunotherapy response in patients. We established a Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which can be used as a preclinical testing platform for assessing efficacy of different immunotherapeutic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model was established by engrafting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into NOD/scid/IL-2Rγ-/- (NSG) mice. Cytokine array was performed to assess serological similarity between patient and the Hu-PBL-NSG mouse, and microscopic immune cell infiltration was observed in various organs mouse model. Human anti-PD-1 therapy was treated for assessing drug efficacy in patient-derived tumor. RESULTS: hCD3+hCD45+ T-cells and antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, and MDSC) increased in the serum of Hu-PBL-NSG mouse 24 h after the transfusion of human PBMCs, and CD3 + T cells were observed in lung, liver, kidney, spleen sections. Cytokine arrays of human and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse revealed high similarity of Th1, Th2, Th17-related cytokines. A tumor xenograft was engrafted from an EML4-ALK patient, and Hu-PBL-NSG mouse was sacrificed for histological analyses. hCD3+ T cells were infiltrated within the tumor, and CD11c + cells, which represent antigen-presenting capability, were seen in spleen, lung, liver and kidney. When anti-PD-1 Ab was treated intraperitoneally, xenograft tumor showed significant reduction in volume after day 6, and increased expression of immune response-related genes on microarray analysis in the tumor. Mostly IFN-gamma and its related gene sets were significantly changed (FDR < 0.25, GSEA). CONCLUSION: Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which highly resembles human immune system was successfully established. This model could be a strong preclinical model for testing efficacy of immunotherapeutic agents, and also for pursuing novel immunotherapy treatment strategies in advanced NSCLC."

Herein, we report a case illustrating a durable response to pembrolizumab after a failure with nivolumab. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 76-year-old white male noticed an enlarging papular lesion on his neck. DIAGNOSIS: Malignant melanoma. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent surgery in December 2013 and was found to have a B-Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (BRAF) V600E mutated melanoma. Treatment with BRAF and MAPK/Erk kinase (MEK) inhibitors along with radiation was initiated. After 1 year, the disease progressed, and the treatment was switched to the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody, ipilimumab. As the tumor did not respond, the treatment was changed to programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) blockers: nivolumab followed by pembrolizumab. Since the initial diagnosis, the tumor response was monitored by computed tomography (CT) scans. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was also used for the assessment of programmed death ligand 1 PD-L1) expression in the neck, lung, and spleen lesions. OUTCOMES: The patient had an initial mixed response to nivolumab, but the disease ultimately progressed as evidenced by new metastases to the spleen, thus the treatment was switched to pembrolizumab. After 46 cycles of treatment, all sites of metastases disappeared, including a substantial shrinkage of the splenic metastasis. To gain understanding about the pharmacological differences between nivolumab and pembrolizumab, the PD-1-ligands interactions and conformational dynamics responsible for the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade were investigated. The higher affinity of pembrolizumab might likely arise from a unique and large patch of interactions engaging the CD loop of PD-1, thus forcing an important motion across the PD-1 immunoreceptor. LESSONS: In this case report, we described the tolerance and response of a melanoma patient to a sequence of various agents, including ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical report highlighting differences between PD-1 blockers, as shown by the unexpected and durable response of the tumor to pembrolizumab, after a treatment failure with nivolumab."

Data outside clinical trials about therapy efficacy and safety in later therapy line treatments have rarely been described until now. METHODS: We performed a retrospective data analysis of patients who were enrolled into the nivolu-mab Compassionate Use Program (CUP) in Germany. Sufficient clinical data of 40 patients were available for efficacy and safety analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 47.5% of all treated patients were not affected by any adverse events (AEs); 17.5% of patients suffered from severe AEs. The 1-year survival rate was 61.3%. Estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months. Patients who received nivolumab as third or later therapy line treatment (77.5%) achieved similar median PFS and 12-month overall survival rate of 52%. CONCLUSION: Our findings of immunotherapy treatment outside clinical trials support the results of studies in the past and confirm the efficacy and favorable toxicity profile of nivolumab treatment in advanced SQ-NSCLC patients.

However, none of these trials included Mexican populations. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis involving 87 patients with advanced cancer who received PD-1 inhibitors as part of their therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of pneumonitis after using PD-1 inhibitors. The secondary outcomes were major risk factors and radiological patterns of pneumonitis. RESULTS: We found 13 cases of pneumonitis, giving an overall incidence of 15%; three of the cases were high-grade (grade 3). A ground-glass pattern was the major form found by chest computed tomography scans. We did not find any significant risk factor for pneumonitis. CONCLUSION: The incidence of pneumonitis secondary to treatment with PD-1 inhibitors in our Mexican population was 15%, which is 5 times higher than that found in other studies. No risk factor was identified for this increased incidence of drug-induced pneumonitis following the use of PD-1 inhibitors.© 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Mutational patterns were heterogeneous for 2 primary tumours. In 3 cases, mutations observed in the primary tumour were not found in LN metastases (ALK, FGFR3, MET). Inversely, in 1 case, a KRAS mutation was found in LN but not in the primary tumour. All primary tumours were found PD-L1 positive while CD8+ T cells infiltrate varied. In the different examined LN samples, PD-L1 expression, CD8+ and PD1+ T cells infiltrate were not similar to the primary tumour.
