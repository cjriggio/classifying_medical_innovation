Recently, several studies have suggested the use of human embryonic stem cell-derived MSCs (hE-MSCs) as an alternative for regenerative cellular therapy due to mass production of MSCs from a single donor. Methods: We generated hE-MSCs from embryonic stem cell lines, SNUhES3, and analyzed immune properties of these cells. Also, we evaluated the in-vivo therapeutic potential of hE-MSCs in immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. Results: The cell showed the suppression of immunity associated with allogenic peripheral blood mononuclear cells in mixed lymphocyte response assay. We also detected that cytokines and growth factor related to the immune response were secreted from these cells. To assessed the in-vivo therapeutic potential of hE-MSCs in immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, we used imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin psoriasis mouse model. The score of clinical skin was significantly reduced in the hE-MSCs treated group compared with control IMQ group. In histological analysis, the IMQ-induced epidermal thickness was significantly decreased by hE-MSCs treatment. It was correlated with splenomegaly induced by IMQ which was also improved in the hE-MSCs. Moreover, IMQ-induced inflammatory cytokines; Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-γ,and IL-27) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23), in the serum and skin showed marked inhibition by hE-MSCs. Conclusion: These results suggested that hE-MSCs have a potency of immune modulation in psoriasis, which might be the key factor for the improved psoriasis."

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory  skin disease in which effector T cells, namely, Th17 and their relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in peripheral blood as well as in the inflamed skin. The status of Tregs in psoriatic skin is continuously studied. In  this case, CD4 + CD25high T cells and other regulatory cytokines such as IL-35 are demonstrated to be significantly decreased. Aiming to better characterize Tregs in psoriatic skin and to establish the finding of their abnormal balance, we assessed the expression of semaphorin3A and neuropilin-1 (both reported as biomarkers of Tregs). Semaphorin3A and neuropilin-1 expressing Tregs were found to be significantly decreased in psoriatic skin when compared to normal skin. These findings were supported by demonstrating the downregulation of IL-10 expression in psoriatic skin. Our findings suggest that semaphoring3A may turn to be a new promising therapeutic approach in the process of improving Treg function in psoriasis."

Peripheral blood regulatory cells(Treg) and T helper cell 17(Th17)ratio was measured by flow cytometry. The anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines expressed and secreted by PBL were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA).Results The Treg/total lymphocyte ratio  was significantly higher in the healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group[(3.2±0.5)%;P=0.001],but AMSCs in patients had a tendency to promote the proliferation of Treg cells [(1.3±0.2)%],with no significant difference(P=0.485)  when compared with the PBL culture alone group[(1.0±0.1)%]. qRT-PCR showed that the ability of PBL in expressing Treg transcription factor forkhead box p3 and transforming growth factor(TGF)-Β mRNA was significantly lower in psoriasis AMSCs+PBL co-culture group than in the healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group(P=0.00,P=0.03),AMSCs had a tendency to promote the expression of interlukin(IL)-10 in peripheral blood lymphocytes,but there was no significant difference(P=0.09).ELISA showed the PBL in healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group secreted the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10[(156.9±41.8) ng/Μl] and TGF-Β[(2774.1 ± 526.4) ng/Μl];in contrast,the abilities of PBL in PV patient AMSCs+PBL co-culture group in secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokines has a downward trend:IL-10[(90.4±28.8) ng/Μl] and TGF-Β[(1597.9±55.7) ng/Μl],although the differences were not statistically significant. After the co-culture,the proportion of Th17 cells in the psoriasis AMSCs+PBL co-culture group[(0.8±0.3)%]  showed a decreasing trend when compared with the PBL culture alone group[(1.1±0.1)%],although the results were not statistically significant. Also,the proportion of Th17 cells showed no significant difference between PV patient AMSCs+PBL co-culture group and healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group. Finally,both the psoriasis AMSCs+PBL co-culture group and the healthy people AMSCs+PBL co-culture group showed no obvious inhibitory effect on the expression  and secretion of Th17 transcription factor retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor Γt and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-23 in PBL,and there was no significant difference between these two groups.Conclusions AMSCs in PV patients have decreased ability in regulating the anti-inflammatory function of peripheral blood Treg lymphocytes. However,they have no effect on the proinflammatory effect of peripheral blood Th17 lymphocytes."

Innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), perform a critical role in the pathophysiology of  psoriasis by presenting inflammatory/costimulatory signals for differentiation of Th17 cells. Recent studies point to the involvement of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) in inflammatory signaling cascade of DCs. However, it is yet to be determined whether SYK inhibition in DCs would lead to diminishment of psoriatic  inflammation. Therefore, our study evaluated the effects of SYK inhibitor, R406 on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation, expression of costimulatory/inflammatory molecules in DCs and their relationship with Th17/Treg cells. Our data show that R406 causes attenuation of IMQ-induced dermal inflammation as shown by reduction in ear/back skin thickness, acanthosis and myeloperoxidase activity. This was concurrent with reduction in inflammatory cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules in CD11c + DCs such as IL-6, IL-23, MHCII, and CD40. This favoured the suppression of Th17 cells and upregulation of Treg cells in R406-treated mice with psoriasis-like inflammation. Direct activation of TLR7 by IMQ in splenocytic cultures led to increased SYK expression in CD11c + DCs and release of IL-23/IL-6. IMQ-induced IL-6/IL-23 levels were significantly diminished by SYK inhibitor, R406 in splenocytic cultures. In essence, our study shows that SYK inhibition supresses psoriasis-like inflammation by modifying DC function in mice. Further, it implies that SYK inhibition could be a prospective therapeutic approach for the treatment of psoriasis-like inflammation."

IL-23p19 inhibition with risankizumab resulted in superior clinical responses in patients  with psoriasis compared with ustekinumab (dual IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor), but comparative molecular effects have not been established. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the similarities and differences in molecular and histopathologic profiles in skin lesions from patients with psoriasis receiving risankizumab versus ustekinumab at an early time point. METHODS: Lesional skin biopsy samples from 81 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis participating in 2 different studies (a phase I risankizumab study and a phase II study of risankizumab vs ustekinumab) were analyzed by using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Risankizumab induced a rapid decrease in levels of proteins and transcriptomic biomarkers associated with the IL-23 pathway, which were maintained through 8 weeks. At week 4, risankizumab decreased histopathologic expression of biomarkers, including K16, Ki67, CD3, lipocalin-2, CD11c, dendritic cell lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein, β-defensin 2, and S100A7; global  histopathologic scoring revealed that 54% and 69% of patients treated with 90 or  180 mg of risankizumab, respectively, were graded as experiencing excellent improvement versus 29% of patients treated with ustekinumab. At week 4, there was a common decrease in expression of 2645 genes expressed in lesional skin between patients receiving risankizumab and ustekinumab and a significant decrease in 2682 genes unique to risankizumab treatment. Risankizumab more strongly downregulated expression of genes associated with keratinocytes, epidermal cells, and monocytes, versus ustekinumab. CONCLUSION: Risankizumab demonstrated more pronounced changes in the molecular and histopathologic profile of psoriatic skin lesions compared with ustekinumab at week 4."

In several chronic inflammatory human diseases, Tregs express IL-17A, suggesting that dysregulation of TH17-associated pathways in Tregs may result in either loss of suppressive function and/or conversion into pathogenic cells. The pathways that regulate the TH17 program in Tregs are poorly understood. We have identified two  TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) members, CD27 and OX40, that are preferentially expressed by skin-resident Tregs Both CD27 and OX40 signaling suppressed the expression of TH17-associated genes from Tregs in a cell-intrinsic manner in vitro and in vivo. However, only OX40 played a nonredundant role in promoting Treg accumulation. Tregs that lacked both CD27 and OX40 were defective in controlling skin inflammation and expressed high levels of IL-17A, as well as the master TH17 transcription factor, RORγt. Last, we found that CD27 expression was  inversely correlated with Treg IL-17 production in skin of patients with psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Together, our results suggest that TNFRSF members play both redundant and distinct roles in regulating Treg plasticity in tissues."

However, blood phenotyping across these subsets is not yet available in patients  with vitiligo. OBJECTIVE: We sought to measure cytokine production by circulating skin-homing (CLA+) versus systemic (CLA-) polar CD4+/CD8+ ratio and activated T-cell subsets in patients with vitiligo compared with patients with AA, AD, or psoriasis and control subjects. METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to measure levels of the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-13, IL-9, IL-17, and IL-22 in CD4+/CD8+ T cells in the blood of 19 patients with moderate-to-severe nonsegmental/generalized vitiligo, moderate-to-severe AA (n = 32), psoriasis (n = 24), or AD (n = 43) and control subjects (n = 30). Unsupervised clustering differentiated subjects into groups based on cellular frequencies. RESULTS: Patients with Vitiligo showed the highest CLA+/CLA- TH1/type 1 cytotoxic T-cell polarization, with parallel TH2/TH9/TH17/TH22 level increases to levels often greater than those seen in patients with AA, AD, or psoriasis (P < .05). Total regulatory T-cell counts were lower in patients with vitiligo than in control subjects and patients with AD or psoriasis (P < .001). Vitiligo severity  correlated with levels of multiple cytokines (P < .1), whereas duration was linked with IFN-γ and IL-17 levels (P < .04). Patients and control subjects grouped into separate clusters based on blood biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Vitiligo is characterized by a multicytokine polarization among circulating skin-homing and systemic subsets, which differentiates it from other  inflammatory/autoimmune skin diseases. Future targeted therapies should delineate the relative contribution of each cytokine axis to disease perpetuation."

These T-cells express IL-17A and the lineage-defining transcription factor RORγt. Th17 cells have a pivotal, physiological role in host defense against pathogens. These pro-inflammatory T-cells are also key players in autoimmunity and a pathogenic role has been demonstrated in several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis. Recently, there is evidence that Th17 cells may drive renal inflammation and renal autoimmunity in anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody-(ANCA)-vasculitis and  systemic lupus erythematosus. The aim of this review is to discuss the possible involvement of Th17 cells in renal autoimmunity and its value for future therapeutic approaches."

Cutis. 2018 Nov;102(5S):6-12.","Update on the pathophysiology of psoriasis.","Psoriasis is a genetically programmed pathologic interaction among skin cells, immunocytes, and numerous biologic signaling molecules that is triggered by environmental stimuli. The immune response is a cellular one; type 1 (TH1) and type 17 (TH17) T cells are activated by IL-12 and IL-23 secreted by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin. Through various cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, these cells cause a chronic inflammatory state and alter epidermal hyperproliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and neoangiogenesis that produce the cutaneous findings seen in this disease. The newer biologic therapies target the immunologic signaling pathways and cytokines  identified in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and provide notable clinical improvement. Further study in the pathogenesis of psoriasis can help identify targets for future therapies."

The Yin-Yang of TNF and Type I Interferon.","Chronic plaque psoriasis is a common debilitating skin disease. The identification of the pathogenic role of the TNF/IL-23/TH17 pathway has enabled the development of targeted therapies used in the clinic today. Particularly, TNF inhibitors have become a benchmark for the treatment of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis. Although being highly effective in psoriasis treatment, anti-TNFs can themselves induce psoriasis-like skin lesions, a side effect called paradoxical psoriasis. In this review, we provide a comprehensive look at the different cellular and molecular players involved in classical plaque psoriasis and contrast its pathogenesis to paradoxical psoriasis, which is clinically similar but immunologically distinct. Classical psoriasis is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease driven by TNF, characterised by T-cells memory, and a relapsing disease course. In contrast, paradoxical psoriasis is caused by the absence of TNF and represents an ongoing type-I interferon-driven innate inflammation that fails to elicit T-cell autoimmunity and lacks memory T cell-mediated relapses."

As psoriasis rarely occurs in nonhuman animals, the lack of an ideal animal model reflecting the histopathological and molecular immunological characteristics of psoriasis remains an urgent issue. In the present study, an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis mouse model was constructed under natural immune conditions and verified by evaluations of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score and Baker score, H&E staining, immunohistochemical examination of the CD3 and Gr1 levels, measurement of plasmacytoid dendritic cell- (pDC) and Th17-associated cytokine levels, and evaluation of p65 phosphorylation and TLR7 expression. Moreover, rutaecarpine (RUT), the main active ingredient in the traditional Chinese medicine Wu-Zhu-Yu, could improve psoriasis-like dermatitis through effects on pDC- and Th17-associated cytokines through NF-κB and toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling. Taken together, the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis mouse model can be regarded as an ideal model for evaluating psoriasis pathogenesis and antipsoriatic drugs. We provided theoretical and experimental evidence for the clinical application of RUT in psoriasis."

However, its mechanism of action is not well understood, limiting its medical use. We isolated and identified three compounds, namely niazirin, marumoside A and sitosterol-3-O-β-d-glucoside, from the seeds of Moringa oleifera, and studied their effects on the expression of Th17-relevant cytokines (IL-12/IL-23 p40, IL-17A, IL-22 and IL-23 p19) using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells. Additionally, as Th17 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we used a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced psoriasis-like skin lesion mouse model to study their potential therapeutic application in vivo. The compounds suppressed the expression of IL-12/IL-23 p40, IL-17A, IL-22 and IL-23 p19 in vitro, and in vivo they ameliorated psoriasis-like skin lesions, decreased IL-17A mRNA expression, and increased the expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the mechanism and therapeutic application of Moringa oleifera seeds to treat psoriasis-like lesions in vivo."

Because we and others have observed increased NETosis in psoriatic  lesions, we hypothesized that NETs contribute to increased T helper type 17 (Th17) cells in psoriasis. After stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with anti-CD3/CD28 beads for 7 days, we found significantly higher percentages of CD3+CD4+IL-17+ (Th17) cells in the presence versus absence of NETs, as assessed by flow cytometry, IL-17 ELISA, and IL17A/F and RORC mRNAs. Memory, but not naïve, T cells were competent and monocytes were required for CD3/CD28-mediated Th17 induction, with or without NETs. Th17 induction was enhanced by the T allele of rs33980500 (T/C), a psoriasis risk-associated variant in the TRAF3IP2 gene encoding the D10N variant of Act1, a key mediator of IL-17 signal transduction. Global transcriptome analysis of CD3/CD28-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RNA sequencing confirmed the stimulatory effects of NETs, demonstrated NET-induced enhancement of cytokine gene expression, and verified that the effect of Act1 D10N was greater in the presence of NETs. Collectively, these results implicate NETs and the Act1 D10N variant in human Th17 induction from peripheral  blood mononuclear cells, with ramifications for immunogenetic studies of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases."

PSORI-CM02 is a representative herbal formula for the treatment for PS in South China. It was confirmed to improve PS without obvious side effects in the clinic. Here we sought to clarify whether and how PSORI-CM02 regulates T cell differentiation and functions in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like BALB/c mouse model. Mice pre-treated 3 days with PSORI-CM02 significantly alleviated skin inflammation, as reduced in PASI score and classic  psoriatic characteristics in pathological sections. CD3 and CD4 positive T cells  were also fewer in the skin lesions of PSORI-CM02 groups, comparing to control group. PSORI-CM02 also decreased pro-inflammatory IFNγ mRNA and IL-17 A mRNA, while increased IL-4 mRNA in mouse skin lesions. In skin draining lymph nodes (DLN), PSORI-CM02 reduced the ratio of γδT cells and inhibited their function of  producing IL-17 A. Nevertheless PSORI-CM02 had no effects on the ratio of total TCRβ+T cells and CD4 + T cells. But it regulated CD4 + T helper cells differentiation, and resulted in the decreasing percentage of IFNγ producing Th1  cells and IL-17 A producing Th17 cells, while increasing the ratio of IL-4 producing Th2 cells in DLN. Further data showed that PSORI-CM02 promote expression of Th2 specific transcript factor GATA3, but had no effects on T-bet and RORγ. Thus, we tentatively interpret that PSORI-CM02 impairs IMQ-induced psoriasis by promoting Th2 cell response targeting of GATA3."

To avoid drug resistance during cancer treatment, many researchers focused on the study of the downstream therapeutic target of RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, ERK1/2 became a hot anticancer target. It has been shown that ERK phosphorylation could activate Th17 cells and therefore induce inflammatory diseases. Due to these results, inhibition of ERK, as a potential drug target, could provide a solution for autoimmune diseases, especially T cell mediated diseases. In this study, a small  synthetic molecule JSI287 was found with the function of alleviating IMQ-induced  mice skin lesions through ERK/IL-17 signaling pathway during the screening of small molecule databases targeting ERK. The results showed that JS1287 small molecule alleviated epidermal thickness, epidermis congestion, edema and inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased release of inflammatory cytokines of IL-6, IL-12 and IL-17A, and further regulated the mRNA expression of ATF1 and protein expression of ERK1/2 in IMQ-induced skin lesions.

While most therapeutic approaches have been centered on insulin replacement, newer approaches to target the underlying immune response have become an area of focus. However, the immune landscape in T1D is extremely complex, and the roles played by individual cytokines during disease progression are incompletely understood, making the development of immunotherapies very difficult. In this review, we discuss the complex auxiliary role played by IL-17, both around the islet and in  peripheral tissues such as the gut and kidney, which might influence T1D progression. Through our re-analysis of the key factors involved IL-17 signaling  in recently published single-cell sequencing and sorted-cell bulk sequencing datasets, we find supporting evidence for the general existence of the signaling  apparatus in islet endocrine cells. We also explore the emerging evidence of IL-17 serving as an influential factor in diabetic complications that affect distal tissues. While anti-IL-17 therapies are emerging as an option for psoriasis and other autoimmune disorders, we highlight here a number of questions that would need to be addressed before their potential applicability to treating  T1D can be fully evaluated."

We speculated that an anti-IL-23 receptor mAb might have greater efficacy than an anti-IL-23 mAb in the treatment of local inflamed lesions with high IL-23 levels. We previously generated an anti-human IL-23 receptor mAb, AS2762900-00, which potently blocked IL-23-induced cell proliferation, regardless of the concentration of IL-23. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of AS2762900-00 in the treatment of psoriasis. Compared with untreated control, AS2762900-00 significantly reduced the epidermal thickness of lesions in a clinically relevant psoriatic human skin xenograft model. The expression of inflammatory genes including genes downstream of IL-23 signaling in the lesion tended to be lower in the AS2762900-00 group than the untreated group, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of AS2762900-00 in the psoriatic human skin xenograft model might occur via blockade of IL-23 signaling pathways. Further, AS2762900-00 showed an inhibitory effect on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation as a downstream signal of IL-23 receptor activation in whole blood from patients with psoriasis. We also confirmed that AS2762900-00 inhibited IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner using whole blood from healthy donors. These data suggest that AS2762900-00 is a  promising drug candidate for the treatment of psoriasis. In addition, STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood may be a useful biomarker for the evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effects of AS2762900-00 in healthy volunteers in clinical development."

To test this, we generated a knock-in model for diphtheria toxin-mediated conditional γδ T cell depletion. In contrast  to IFN-γ-producing γδ T cells, IL-17-producing γδ T cells (Tγδ17 cells) recovered inefficiently after depletion, and their niches were filled by expanding Th17 cells and ILC3s. Complementary genetic fate mapping further demonstrated that Tγδ17 cells are long-lived and persisting lymphocytes.

Among skin-derived  pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-36 family members are highly upregulated in PV patients and play a critical role in general pustular psoriasis. However, there is limited data showing crosstalk between the IL-23 and IL-36 pathways in PV. Herein, potential attenuation of skin inflammation in the IL-23-induced mouse model of psoriasiform dermatitis by functional inhibition of IL-36 receptor (IL-36R) was interrogated. Anti-mouse IL-36R monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated and validated in vitro by inhibiting IL-36α-induced secretion of CXCL1  from NIH 3T3 cells. Antibody target engagement was demonstrated by inhibition of  CXCL1 production in a novel acute model of IL-36α systemic injection in mice. In  addition, anti-IL-36R mAbs inhibited tissue inflammation and inflammatory gene expression in an IL-36α ear injection model of psoriasiform dermatitis demonstrating engagement of the target in the ear skin. To elucidate the possible role of IL-36 signalling in IL-23/Th17 pathway, the ability of anti-IL-36R mAbs to inhibit skin inflammation in an IL-23 ear injection model was assessed. Inhibiting the IL-36 pathway resulted in significant attenuation of skin thickening and psoriasis-relevant gene expression. Taken together, these data suggest a role for IL-36 signalling in the IL-23/Th17 signalling axis in PV."

Extravascular low-density lipoprotein undergoes receptor uptake, whereas high-density lipoprotein (HDL) interacts with cells to acquire cholesterol and then recirculates to plasma. We developed photoactivatable apoA-I to understand how HDL passage through tissue is regulated. We focused on skin and arteries of healthy mice versus those with psoriasis, which carries cardiovascular risk in man. Our findings suggest that psoriasis-affected skin lesions program interleukin-17-producing T cells in draining lymph nodes to home to distal skin and later to arteries. There, these cells mediate thickening of the collagenous matrix, such that larger molecules including lipoproteins become entrapped. HDL transit was rescued by depleting CD4+ T cells, neutralizing interleukin-17, or inhibiting lysyl oxidase that crosslinks collagen. Experimental psoriasis also increased vascular stiffness and atherosclerosis via this common pathway. Thus, interleukin-17 can reduce lipoprotein trafficking and increase vascular stiffness by, at least in part, remodeling collagen."

In psoriatic skin, IL-36 cytokines interfere with keratinocyte cornification programs and induce the release of antimicrobial peptides and chemokines active on neutrophils and Th17 lymphocytes. To date, the role of IL-38 antagonist in psoriasis remains to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that skin and circulating IL-38 levels are reduced in psoriatic patients and in other skin diseases characterized by neutrophilic infiltrate. In psoriasis, the balance of IL-36γ agonist/IL-38 antagonist serum levels is in favor of agonists and is closely associated with disease severity. Interestingly, IL-38 is upregulated by  anti-IL-17A biological treatment and positively correlates with the therapeutic efficacy of secukinumab in psoriatic patients. The downregulation of IL-38 expression is strictly related to keratinocyte de-differentiation triggered by the inflammatory cytokines IL-36γ, IL-17, and IL-22. Finally, we demonstrate that administration of recombinant full-length IL-38 counteracts in vitro the biological processes induced by IL-36γ in human keratinocytes and endothelial cells and attenuates in vivo the severity of the psoriasiform phenotype induced by IMQ in mice. Such effects are achieved by restoring the physiological programs of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, and reducing the immune cell infiltrates."

In this study, we evaluated redox status in memory CD4 + T cells and plasma of patients with psoriasis and its correlation with IL-17 response. To this end, memory T cells were isolated from 10 patients with psoriasis and 10 controls. Intracellular Glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide as well as IL-17  were measured using flow cytometry. Plasma total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) was  quantified by ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay. The expression of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1(SOD1), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2) and cytochrome b-245 beta chain (CYBB) genes were analysed using real-time PCR. Our results showed an increased intracellular ROS production in memory CD4 + T cells of patients compared to controls, (P = 0.04). Furthermore, a significant decrease in expression of catalase gene was found in patients, (P = 0.02). However, no significant differences were observed for intracellular GSH, IL-17 and TAC levels between patients and controls. Also, no correlation was seen between the intracellular IL-17 level and intracellular ROS, GSH and catalase gene expression levels. Collectively, we found an increased ROS production in stimulated memory T cells of patients that could be due to reduced expression of catalase gene. However, it seems that these redox abnormalities have no relationship with IL-17 response in  memory T cells."

There is accumulating evidence that the Th-17 signaling pathway is of critical importance in PsA pathogenesis. Areas covered: Ixekizumab (IXE) is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody directed against IL-17A. Two phase III randomized clinical trials, SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2, unequivocally demonstrated superiority of IXE (80 mg every two or 4 weeks) dosing over placebo in moderate-to-severe PsA patients that failed either NSAIDs, conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), or tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors (TNFi) for numerous articular and cutaneous parameters. IXE also delayed structural progression of PsA. No new safety signals were identified as compared with chronic plaque psoriasis studies which included many more patients. Expert opinion: IXE is a highly effective treatment for moderate to severe PsA patients, including those that have been previously exposed to csDMARD and TNFi.  Most domains of PsA significantly improved with IXE treatment and disease modification was achieved."

Therefore RhoH plays critical roles in the differentiation of T cells; however, the function of RhoH in the effecter phase of the T-cell response has not been fully characterized. OBJECTIVE: We sought to explore the role of RhoH in inflammatory immune responses and investigated the involvement of RhoH in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. METHODS: We analyzed effector T-cell and systemic inflammation in wild-type and RhoH-null mice. RhoH expression in T cells in human PBMCs was quantified by using RT-PCR. RESULTS: RhoH deficiency in mice induced TH17 polarization during effector T-cell differentiation, thereby inducing psoriasis-like chronic dermatitis. Ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 5 (Ubr5) and nuclear receptor subfamily 2  group F member 6 (Nr2f6) expression levels decreased in RhoH-deficient T cells, resulting in increased protein levels and DNA binding activity of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt. The consequential increase in IL-17 and IL-22 production induced T cells to differentiate into TH17 cells. Furthermore, IL-22 binding protein/Fc chimeric protein reduced psoriatic inflammation in RhoH-deficient mice. Expression of RhoH in T cells was lower in patients with psoriasis with very severe symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that RhoH inhibits TH17 differentiation and thereby plays a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Additionally, IL-22 binding protein has therapeutic potential for the treatment of psoriasis."

The IL-20 receptor (R) cytokines IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 are produced in both the peripheral blood and the synovial joint and are induced by Toll-like receptor ligands and autoantibody-associated immune complexes in monocytes. IL-19 seems to have anti-inflammatory functions in arthritis. In contrast, IL-20 and IL-24 increase the production of proinflammatory molecules such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and are associated with bone degradation and radiographic progression.  IL-22 is also associated with progression of bone erosions. This suggests that the IL-22RA1 subunit shared by IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24 is important for bone homeostasis. In line with this, the IL-22RA1 has been found on preosteoclasts in  early RA. IL-26 is produced in high amounts by myofibroblasts and IL-26 stimulation of monocytes is an important inducer of Th17 cells in RA. This indicates a role for IL-26 as an important factor in the interactions between resident synovial cells and infiltrating leukocytes. Clinical trials that investigate inhibitors of IL-20 (fletikumab) and IL-22 (fezakinumab) in psoriasis and RA have been terminated. Instead, it seems that the strategy for modulating the IL-20 cytokine family should take the overlap in cellular sources and effector mechanisms into account. The redundancy encourages inhibition of more than one cytokine or one of the shared receptors. All IL-20 family members utilize the Janus kinase signaling pathway and are therefore potentially inhibited by drugs targeting these enzymes. Effects and adverse effects in ongoing clinical trials with inhibitors of IL-22 and the IL-22RA1 subunit and recombinant IL-22 fusion proteins will possibly provide important information about the IL-20 subfamily of cytokines in the future."

IL-17 is mainly produced by activated Th-17 helper cells upon stimulation by IL-23 and, via binding to its receptors, mediates IL-17-driven cell signaling in keratinocytes. Hyper-proliferation of keratinocytes belongs to major clinical manifestations in psoriasis. To modulate  IL-17-mediated inflammatory cascade, we generated a unique collection of IL-17RA-targeting protein binders that prevent from binding of human IL-17A cytokine to its cell-surface receptor. To this goal, we used a highly complex combinatorial library derived from scaffold of albumin-binding domain (ABD) of streptococcal protein G, and ribosome display selection, to yield a collection of ABD-derived high-affinity ligands of human IL-17RA, called ARS binders. From 67 analyzed ABD variants, 7 different sequence families were identified. Representatives of these groups competed with human IL-17A for binding to recombinant IL-17RA receptor as well as to IL-17RA-Immunoglobulin G chimera, as tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Five ARS variants bound to IL-17RA-expressing THP-1 cells and blocked binding of human IL-17 cytokine to the cell surface, as tested by flow cytometry. Three variants exhibited high-affinity binding with a nanomolar Kd value to human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, as measured  using Ligand Tracer Green Line. Upon IL-17-stimulated activation, ARS variants inhibited secretion of Gro-α (CXCL1) by normal human skin fibroblasts in vitro. Thus, we identified a novel class of inhibitory ligands that might serve as immunosuppressive IL-17RA-targeted non-IgG protein antagonists."

Systemic methotrexate (MTX) is an effective treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis; however, its effect on different T-cell subsets is not yet clear. AIM: To study the effect of MTX monotherapy on the psoriatic T-cell profile in the peripheral circulation of patients with psoriasis. METHODS: This was a follow-up study involving 50 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis treated with systemic MTX for 12 weeks. Blood samples (5 mL) were collected from participants, from which PBMCs were isolated, and T-cell phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Following 12 weeks of MTX treatment, there was an increase in the percentages of Th2/Treg cells, and a relative decrease in the percentages of Th1/Th17 cells, along with a significant reduction in the median Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). CONCLUSION: MTX helps in the restoration of the immune balance by decreasing the  numbers of Th1 and Th17 cells and increasing the numbers of Th2 and Treg cells, thus resulting in a significant reduction in disease severity. MTX converts a proinflammatory T-cell phenotype to a protective anti-inflammatory phenotype, thus significantly suppressing the inflammation in psoriasis."

We describe two patients who received secukinumab for clinically presumed psoriasis, but were subsequently diagnosed with mycosis fungoides (MF) following skin biopsies triggered by skin deterioration while on secukinumab. Previous studies suggested  decreased numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) with increasing stage of MF, which may lead to the shift in the Treg/Th17 balance towards the Th17 pathway. Theoretically, the use of IL-17 monoclonal antibodies to inhibit Th17 pathway may lead to further immunosuppression and disease progression in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) by shifting the balance towards Tregs, although this hypothesis has not been proven. With uncertainty over the role of IL-17 and Treg/Th17 as well as diagnostic challenges in CTCL, we recommend that patients should have a confirmatory skin biopsy prior to the commencement of biologic therapy."

A third of psoriatic patients develop PsA via unknown mechanisms. No reliable diagnostic markers are available for PsA, or prognostic biomarkers for PsA development in psoriasis. We previously uncovered a pro-inflammatory role for cathelicidin LL37 in lesional psoriasis skin. LL37 binds nucleic acids and stimulates plasmacytoid/myeloid dendritic cells (pDC, mDCs) to secrete type I interferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory factors. LL37 becomes an autoantigen for  psoriatic Th1-Th17/CD8 T cells. Anti-LL37 antibodies were detected in systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease characterized by neutrophil-extracellular-traps release (NETosis) in target organs. LL37 can be substrate of irreversible post-translational modifications, citrullination or carbamylation, linked to neutrophil activity. Here we analyzed inflammatory factors, included LL37, in PsA and psoriasis plasma and PsA synovial fluids (SF)/biopsies. We show that LL37 (as a product of infiltrating neutrophils) and autoantibodies to LL37 are elevated in PsA, but not OA SF. Anti-LL37 antibodies correlate with clinical inflammatory markers. Anti-carbamylated/citrullinated-LL37 antibodies are present in PsA SF/plasma and, at lower extent, in psoriasis plasma, but not in controls. Plasma anti-carbamylated-LL37 antibodies correlate with PsA (DAS44) but not psoriasis (PASI) disease activity. Ectopic lymphoid structures, and deposition of immunoglobulin-(Ig)G-complexes (IC) co-localizing with infiltrating neutrophils,  are observed in PsA and not OA synovial tissues (ST). Activated complement (C5a,  C9), GM-CSF and IFN-I are up-regulated in PsA and not OA synovia and in PsA and psoriasis plasma but not in HD. C9 and GM-CSF levels in PsA SF correlate with clinical inflammatory markers and DAS44 (C9) and with anti-carbamylated/citrullinated-LL37 antibodies (GM-CSF and IFN-I). Thus, we uncover a role for LL37 as a novel PsA autoantibody target and correlation studies suggest participation of anti-LL37 antibodies to PsA pathogenesis. Notably, plasma antibodies to carbamylated-LL37, which correlate with DAS44, suggest their use as new disease activity markers. GM-CSF and complement C5a and  C9 elevation may be responsible for autoantigens release by neutrophils and their modification, fueling inflammation and autoreactivity establishment. Finally, targeting GM-CSF, C5a, C9 can be beneficial in PsA."

One of the negative regulators of the immune system  is programmed death 1 (PD-1). Aim: To assess the expression level of PD-1 in the peripheral T cells of psoriatic patients with and without arthritis. Material and methods: The study included 23 psoriatic patients with arthritis, 52 psoriatic patients without arthritis and 52 healthy controls.

At the molecular level, psoriasis is commonly driven by a Th17 response, which serves as a major therapeutic target. Microbiome perturbations have been associated with several immune-mediated diseases such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, and multiple  sclerosis. Although a few studies have investigated the association between the skin microbiome and psoriasis, conflicting results have been reported plausibly due to the lack of standardized sampling and profiling protocols, or to inherent  microbial variability across human subjects and underpowered studies. To better understand the link between the cutaneous microbiota and psoriasis, we conducted  an analysis of skin bacterial communities of 28 psoriasis patients and 26 healthy subjects, sampled at six body sites using a standardized protocol and higher sequencing depth compared to previous studies. Mouse studies were employed to examine dermal microbial-immune interactions of bacterial species identified from our study. RESULTS: Skin microbiome profiling based on sequencing the 16S rRNA V1-V3 variable region revealed significant differences between the psoriasis-associated and healthy skin microbiota. Comparing the overall community structures, psoriasis-associated microbiota displayed higher diversity and more heterogeneity compared to healthy skin bacterial communities. Specific microbial signatures were associated with psoriatic lesional, psoriatic non-lesional, and healthy skin. Specifically, relative enrichment of Staphylococcus aureus was strongly associated with both lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin. In contrast, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes were underrepresented in psoriatic lesions compared to healthy skin, especially on the arm, gluteal fold,  and trunk. Employing a mouse model to further study the impact of cutaneous Staphylcoccus species on the skin T cell differentiation, we found that newborn mice colonized with Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated strong Th17 polarization,  whereas mice colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis or un-colonized controls showed no such response. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that microbial communities on psoriatic skin is substantially different from those on healthy skin. The psoriatic skin microbiome has increased diversity and reduced stability compared to the healthy skin microbiome. The loss of community stability and decrease in immunoregulatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes may lead  to higher colonization with pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, which could  exacerbate cutaneous inflammation along the Th17 axis."

Hypothesis/Purpose: To assess the therapeutic value of DGLHT for the treatment of psoriasis, a Th1 and/or Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease, and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: An in vivo mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation was used to investigate the effect of DGLHT. The anti-inflammatory effects of an ethanolic extract of DGLHT (DGLHT-E) and the mechanism responsible  were examined in an in vitro model using IL-1α, IL-17A, IL-22, oncostatin M, plus TNF-α (M5) stimulated HaCaT cells. The anti-proliferative effect of DGLHT-E was examined by analyzing the expression levels of K16, K17 and Ki67 in IL-22 stimulated HaCaT cells. RESULTS: Topical application of 1% DGLHT-E significantly reduced psoriasis-like symptoms including scaling and epidermal hyperplasia in IMQ-treated mice. Immunohistochemical studies showed that DGLHT-E exerted potent anti-inflammatory  effects by inhibiting IL-22 production in local skin lesions. DGLHT-E also attenuated the productions of CXCL10 and CCL20 in M5-stimulated HaCaT cells by suppressing the ERK1/2, JNK and STAT3 signaling pathways.

CONCLUSION: These results suggested that DGLHT-E offers a possible treatment for  psoriasis, and that berberine hydrochloride might be a useful component of ointment-based treatments for psoriatic lesions."

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a VD3 A maxacalcitol and betamethasone valerate (BV) steroid lotion on topical imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasiform skin inflammation. METHODS: Female BALB/c mice were treated with vehicle, maxacalcitol or BV lotion  on the skin for 3 days, and IMQ cream for 6 days. q-PCR, H&E, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence studies were performed on skin samples. Additionally, mice were treated with vehicle, maxacalcitol or BV lotion  for 3 days and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD4+CD25- cells from each group were isolated from lymph nodes. Adoptive transfer of the cells was performed on recipient mice which were treated with IMQ cream for 6 days, and skin samples were obtained for q-PCR and H&E staining. RESULTS: Maxacalcitol and BV were comparable in regards clinical improvement, although maxacalcitol reduced the MHC Class II+ inflammatory cell infiltration more than BV in IMQ skin. While both treatments downregulated IL-17 A, IL-17 F, IL-22, IL-12p40, TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression levels, only maxacalcitol downregulated IL-23p19 expression. Significantly increased Foxp3+ cell infiltrations and IL-10 expression were noted in maxacalcitol-treated IMQ skin. Adoptive transfer of Treg cells from maxacalcitol-treated donor mice improved IMQ-induced inflammation clinically and histopathologically more than the recipients of Treg cells from BV-treated donor groups, showing reduced levels of  inflammatory cytokines and increased IL-10 expression. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that maxacalcitol reduces psoriasiform skin inflammation by inducing Treg cells as well as downregulating IL-23 and IL-17 production."

Recent studies have revealed that IL-17-producing γδ T cells (γδ17 cells) in addition to IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells [T helper type 17 (Th17) cells] are often the main producers of IL-17 in mouse models of inflammatory diseases. γδ T cells are functionally committed during intra-thymic  differentiation. γδ thymocytes capable of producing IL-17, which express the transcription factor retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor γt and the signature cytokine receptor IL-23R, leave the thymus, and produce IL-17 rapidly by the stimulation with IL-1β and IL-23 in the periphery. Therefore, γδ17 cells play important roles in the early phase of host defence against pathogens and in  inflammatory diseases. γδ T cells that can produce IL-17 are also increased in the skin of patients with psoriasis and in peripheral blood of patients with ankylosing sclerosis. Indeed, the therapy targeting IL-17 has been approved or is in clinical trials, and proved to be very efficient to treat psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing sclerosis. In this review, we discuss recent knowledge about the pathophysiological function of γδ17 cells in infection and inflammatory diseases and therapeutic advances targeting IL-17."

Several new drugs, targeting the IL-23/IL-17A pathway, have been recently licensed or are in clinical development. These therapies represent a major improvement of the way in which psoriasis is managed, since they show an unprecedented efficacy on skin symptoms of psoriasis. This has been made possible, thanks to an increasingly more accurate pathogenic view of psoriasis. Today, the belief that Th17 cells mediate psoriasis is moving to the concept of psoriasis as an IL-17A-driven disease. New questions arise at the horizon, given that IL-17A is part of a newly described family of cytokines, which has five distinct homologous: IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E, also known as IL-25 and IL-17F. IL-17 family cytokines elicit similar effects in target cells,  but simultaneously trigger different and sometimes opposite functions in a tissue-specific manner. This is complicated by the fact that IL-17 cytokines show a high capacity of synergisms with other inflammatory stimuli. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge around the cytokines belonging to the IL-17  family in relation to skin inflammation in general and psoriasis in particular, and discuss possible clinical implications. A comprehensive understanding of the  different roles played by the IL-17 cytokines is crucial to appreciate current and developing therapies and to allow an effective pathogenesis- and mechanisms-driven drug design."

This study aimed to determine the relationship between PRL and psoriasis through clinical case-control studies, and explore the function of PRL in the pathogenesis of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like mouse model. Serum from patients with psoriasis vulgaris (PsV), patients with erythrodermic psoriasis, and healthy controls (HCs) were collected for PRL test.

Mice were divided into four groups (each n = 6): control group (CON), IMQ group, anti-PRL group and solvent group. Anti-PRL group and solvent group mice were treated with PRL antagonist (cabergoline) and the solvent (0.25% methylcellulose) separately. The serum PRL level of PsV patients was significantly higher than that of HCs (P < 0.001). Compared with HCs, the mRNA levels of PRL and Th1/Th17 cytokines in skin lesions  increased significantly (P < 0.05), and the PRL protein level was also significantly elevated in the epidermis and dermis of PsV patients. In IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mouse model, the mRNA and protein levels of PRL in skin lesions were significantly higher than CON group (P < 0.01). Comparing to solvent group, serum PRL level and PRL, cytokines mRNA levels in skin lesions all decreased significantly and the skin inflammatory condition was also alleviated obviously in anti-PRL group. This study suggests that local production of PRL is  the main resource of PRL in skin lesions and may play an important role in skin inflammatory of psoriasis."

This article reviews the immunologic role of interleukin (IL)-17, the major effector cytokine in the pathogenesis of psoriatic disease, along with the rationale for targeting the IL-17 cytokine family (IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17 receptor A) in the treatment of  psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Emerging evidence indicates that major sources of IL-17A in patients with psoriatic disease are mast cells, γδ T cells, αβ T cells, and innate lymphoid cells in lesional skin and synovial fluid. Within the  skin and joints, IL-17A acts on cellular targets, including keratinocytes, neutrophils, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, osteoclasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, to stimulate production of various antimicrobial peptides, chemokines, and proinflammatory and proliferative cytokines, which, in turn, promote tissue inflammation and bone remodeling. The critical importance of the IL-23/IL-17A axis to the pathogenesis of psoriatic disease has resulted in many new biologic treatments targeting these cytokines. These biologics dramatically improve skin and joint symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis."

Gene expression studies in human contact allergy focusing on immune responses revealed nickel being an inducer of T helper (Th)1/Th17 and some Th22 immune polarization, whereas fragrances were found to promote a Th2-dominated immune activation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the epidemiological association between contact allergy and psoriasis in a large multicentre cohort and to analyse the sensitization profile to specific allergens in these patients. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patch-tested patients from 56 departments of dermatology (1996-2015), including 2387 patients with psoriasis and 161 989 control patients. All patients with atopic dermatitis were excluded from both groups. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) for contact allergy was calculated to be 0·55 in patients with psoriasis (95% confidence interval 0·50-0·59). Logistic regression  analyses with several independent variables indicated a protective effect of having psoriasis for most allergens, independently of age, sex, affected body site and patch test indication. Fragrance mix II (OR 0·36) and lanolin alcohols (OR 0·38) were found to be among the least common allergens in patients with psoriasis. In contrast, the frequency of contact dermatitis to nickel was only marginally affected in patients with psoriasis compared with controls (OR 0·75). CONCLUSIONS: The inverse association between psoriasis and allergic contact sensitization is likely to be not exclusively mediated by psoriasis itself. The polarization of the activated immune response by specific allergens may influence the occurrence and significance of contact allergies in underlying immune-mediated diseases, eventually even beyond the skin."

However, their actual significance and the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address these issues, we focused on resolvin E1 (RvE1), an omega-3 PUFAs-derived metabolite, and examined its effects on psoriatic dermatitis, using an imiquimod-induced mouse psoriasis model. RvE1 potently suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration and epidermal hyperplasia  in the psoriatic skin. RvE1 decreased the mRNA expression of IL-23 in the skin. Consistently, RvE1 inhibited IL-23 production by dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro.  Furthermore, RvE1 exerted inhibitory effects on migration of cutaneous DCs and γδ T cells, a major IL-17-producing cell population in mouse, both in vivo and in vitro. These suppressive effects of RvE1 were mediated by its antagonistic function on BLT1, a receptor of leukotriene B4, and were also observed in human DCs, Th17 and Tc17 cells. Our results indicate a novel mechanism of omega-3 PUFA-mediated amelioration of psoriasis, and suggest a potential of RvE1 as a therapeutic target for psoriasis."

Recent research points to a central role of the microbiome, which is highly influenced by multiple environmental and dietary factors. It is well established that the microbiome can modulate the immune response, from cellular development to organ and tissue formation exerting its effects through multiple interactions with both the innate and acquired branches of the immune system. It has been described at some extent changes in environment and nutrition produce dysbiosis in the gut but also in the skin, and lung microbiome, inducing qualitative and quantitative changes in composition and metabolic activity. Here, we review the potential role of the skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiomes in allergic diseases. In the GIT, the microbiome has been proven to be important in  developing either effector or tolerant responses to different antigens by balancing the activities of Th1 and Th2 cells. In the lung, the microbiome may play a role in driving asthma endotype polarization, by adjusting the balance between Th2 and Th17 patterns. Bacterial dysbiosis is associated with chronic inflammatory disorders of the skin, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Thus, the microbiome can be considered a therapeutical target for treating inflammatory diseases, such as allergy. Despite some limitations, interventions with probiotics, prebiotics, and/or synbiotics seem promising for the development of a preventive therapy by restoring altered microbiome functionality, or as an adjuvant in specific immunotherapy."

Indigo Naturalis has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease in which γδ T cells play an important role. This study aims to determine the immunoregulatory effects and the underlying mechanisms of Indirubin in psoriasis-related inflammatory responses. METHODS: BALB/c mice with imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis were  treated with saline (Model), 1 mg/kg methotrexate (MTX) that serves as a positive control, or 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg Indirubin(IR) intragastrically. Keratinocytes proliferation, inflammatory cells infiltration, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and Jak/Stat pathway-related proteins in the skin lesion were examined. The abundance of γδ T cells in lymph nodes and spleen was determined by flow cytometry. The IL-17 expression and secretion, and the activation of Jak3/Stat3 pathways in in vitro cultured γδ T cell were tested. RESULTS: Indirubin ameliorated keratinocyte proliferation, reduced the infiltration of CD3+ T cells, IL-17 A-producing γδ T cells, and CD11b+ neutrophils, inhibited the mRNA expression of Il1, Il6, Il23, Il17a and Il22, and the protein expression of Jak/Stat pathway-related molecules in the skin lesion.  Indirubin also reduced the abundance of γδ T cell and CCR6+ γδ T cells (the major IL-17 A producer) in spleen and lymph nodes. In cultured γδ T cells, Indirubin inhibited the mRNA expression of Il17a and Ifng, and the secretion of IL-17 A, while suppressed the activation of Jak3/Stat3 pathways. CONCLUSION: Indirubin alleviates IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis mainly through reducing the inflammatory responses mediated by IL-17 A-producing γδ T cells involving Jak3/Stat3 activation. Our results highlighted the novel mechanisms by which Indirubin ameliorates psoriasis-related inflammatory responses, supporting its therapeutic potential."

According to the current immune theory, activation of dendritic cells initiates the generation of this axis. However, this theory is not enough to explain the mechanism, because the process of this activation is obscure and the antigen that is recognized by antigen-presenting cells and pathogenic T cells has long been unidentified. Therefore, I thought of another theory as follows. Neutrophils are  attracted by LTB4 at subcorneal portion and infiltrate into the epidermis. At the time of neutrophil migration through the basement membrane, basal keratinocytes in G0/G1 phase enter the cell cycle and begin to proliferate, according to the principle, detachment-mediated cell proliferation. This passing is continuously repeated and leads to elongation of rete ridges. The IL-23/Th17 axis is generated by interactions between infiltrated neutrophils and keratinocytes. Briefly, neutrophils infiltrated into the epidermis secrete IL-17A, which acts on keratinocytes to express CCL20, a ligand for the chemokine receptor CCR6. Keratinocytes perturbed by neutrophil infiltration produce HSP70, followed by production of IL-23 via TLR4 using HSP70 as an endogenous ligand for TLR4. Natural Th17 cells expressing CCR6 are recruited to psoriatic epidermis and expand there in the presence of IL-23 and IL-1β. In this manner, the framework of the IL-23/Th17 axis is created, which acts to maintain or exacerbate psoriasis. Noteworthy is the fact that this axis causes positive feedback loop, starting from IL-17A production by neutrophils and ending in IL-17A production by nTh17 cells. Therapeutic mechanisms of anti-IL-17A and anti-IL-23 antibodies, targeting neutrophils, were also described."

Recently, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that multiple miRNAs are dysregulated in patients with various autoimmune diseases and mediate autoimmune disease pathologic condition at least in part through the regulation of Th17 response. However, among the few miRNAs identified so far that play possible roles in the differentiation of Th17 cells, they all regulate the Th17 response through targeting negative or positive regulators of Th17 differentiation. In the current study, we sought to identify new miRNAs that can directly regulate the expression of IL-17A, the most important cytokine produced by Th17 cells. Our results showed that the 3 untranslated region of mouse IL-17A can act as a negative regulatory  element to downregulate gene expression. Further study revealed that miR-340 can  specifically bind to the 3 untranslated region of mouse IL-17A and downregulate  the expression of endogenous IL-17A.

Although recent evidence suggests that IRF5 interacts with certain members of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, the extent of cooperation  and its implications in disease are ambiguous. Since both pathways are known for  their strong contributions in TLR8 signaling we used the human monocytic cell line THP-1.Dual, featuring gene reporters for NF-κB and IRFs, to simultaneously study the roles of IRF5 and the NF-κB subunit p65 in TLR8-mediated gene reporter  activities. Furthermore, we profiled from these cells the proinflammatory cytokines involved in the differentiation of TH1 and TH17 cells. After ablation of IRF5 and/or p65 we activated the resultant cells with the TLR8 agonists R848 or the psoriasis-associated antimicrobial peptide LL-37 complexed with ssRNA and  demonstrate that IRF5 deficiency drastically impairs the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TNFα. In contrast, the lack of p65 impaired only IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23 secretion. Furthermore, we discovered that upon TLR8 stimulation, IRF5 but not NF-κB signaling is essential to provide a cytokine milieu supporting TH1 responses. Additionally, we demonstrate that IRF5 and NF-κB cooperate to provide a cytokine milieu supporting TH17 responses. Therefore, the  distinct role of IRF5 in the intricate signaling network downstream of TLR8 may open new treatment options interfering with but not disrupting NF-κB signaling in human diseases."

By contrast, the contribution of  IFNγ-producing T cells has progressively become less clear because of the lack of efficacy of anti-IFNγ antibodies in clinical studies. In parallel, the role of CD8+ T cells specific for self-antigens has been revived and increasing evidence  now indicates that in psoriatic skin the majority CD8+ T cells are present in the form of epidermal tissue-resident memory T cells. In the last years it also emerged the possibility of a contribution of T cell recirculation in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and its systemic manifestations. The aim of this review is to define a hierarchy for the different subsets of T cells in the T cell-mediated inflammatory cascade in psoriatic skin.

Areas covered: Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-12 and IL-23. The pathogenesis of PsO and PsA is a multifactorial process involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. IL-23 signaling and activation of  Th17 cells leads to a self-perpetuating inflammatory loop resulting in continuous keratinocyte proliferation and synovitis. Treatment options are varied, ranging from topical therapy to injection of targeted biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Evidence on the use of ustekinumab in the management of PsO is strong, but it is not as impressive in management of PsA. Expert opinion: IL-12/23 inhibition appears to be a good first-line option for plaque PsO, but efficacy in PsA does not compare favorably to IL-17 inhibition. In general, poorer responses to therapy with any bDMARD in PsA cohorts highlight  psoriatic disease heterogeneity. Until new knowledge can remedy the failure of monotherapy, synergistic methods may have to be explored, including combination biologic therapy."

However, how IL-23 generates pathogenic TH17 cells remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the involvement, molecular mechanisms, and clinical implications of prostaglandin (PG) E2-EP2/EP4 signaling in induction of  IL-23-driven pathogenic TH17 cells. METHODS: The role of PGE2 in induction of pathogenic TH17 cells was investigated  in mouse TH17 cells in culture in vitro and in an IL-23-induced psoriasis mouse model in vivo. Clinical relevance of the findings in mice was examined by using gene expression profiling of IL-23 and PGE2-EP2/EP4 signaling in psoriatic skin from patients. RESULTS: IL-23 induces Ptgs2, encoding COX2 in TH17 cells, and produces PGE2, which acts back on the PGE receptors EP2 and EP4 in these cells and enhances IL-23-induced expression of an IL-23 receptor subunit gene, Il23r, by activating  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1, and nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) through cyclic AMP-protein kinase A signaling. This PGE2 signaling also induces expression of various inflammation-related genes, which possibly function in TH17 cell-mediated pathology. Combined deletion of EP2 and EP4 selectively in T cells suppressed accumulation of IL-17A+ and IL-17A+IFN-γ+ pathogenic Th17 cells and abolished skin inflammation in an IL-23-induced psoriasis mouse model. Analysis of human psoriatic skin biopsy specimens shows positive correlation between PGE2 signaling and the IL-23/TH17 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: T cell-intrinsic EP2/EP4 signaling is critical in IL-23-driven generation of pathogenic TH17 cells and consequent pathogenesis in the skin."

The Contribution of Interleukin (IL)-17/IL-22-Producing γδ T Cells, αβ  T Cells, and Innate Lymphoid Cells to the Pathogenesis of Spondyloarthritis.","γδ T cells, αβ T cells, and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are capable of producing interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22. Among these three families of lymphocytes, it is emerging that γδ T cells are, at least in rodents, the main source of these key pro-inflammatory cytokines. γδ T cells were implicated in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, experimental  autoimmune encephalomyelitis and uveitis, colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent findings pointed toward a central role of γδ T cells in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis (SpA), a group of inflammatory rheumatic diseases affecting  the axial skeleton. SpA primarily manifests as inflammation and new bone formation at the entheses, which are connecting tendons or ligaments with bone. In SpA patients, joint inflammation is frequently accompanied by extra-articular  manifestations, such as inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis. In humans, genome-wide association studies could link the IL-23/IL-17 cytokine axis to SpA.  Accordingly, antibodies targeting IL-23/IL-17 for SpA treatment already showed promising results in clinical studies. However, the contribution of IL-17-producing γδ T cells to SpA pathogenesis is certainly not an open-and-shut  case. Indeed, the cell types that are chiefly involved in local inflammation in human SpA still remain largely unclear. Some studies focusing on blood or synovium from SpA patients reported augmented IL-17-producing and IL-23 receptor-expressing γδ T cells, but other cell types might contribute as well. Here, we summarize the current understanding of how γδ T cells, αβ T cells, and ILCs contribute to the pathogenesis of human and experimental SpA."

To date, treatments for psoriasis remain unsatisfied because of their clinical limitations and various side effects. Thus, developing a safer and more effective therapy for psoriasis is compelling. Previous studies have explicitly shown that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that is predominantly mediated by T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which express high levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17) in response to interleukin-23 (IL-23). The discovery of the IL-23-Th17-IL-17 axis in the development of psoriasis has led to the paradigm shift of understanding pathogenesis of psoriasis. Although anti-IL-17 antibodies show marked clinical efficacy in treating psoriasis, compared with antibodies targeting IL-17A or IL-17R alone, targeting Th17 cells themselves may have a maximal benefit by affecting multiple  proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which likely act synergistically to drive skin inflammation in psoriasis. In this review, we mainly focus on the critical role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Especially, we explore the small molecules that target retinoid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), a vital transcription factor for Th17 cells. Given that RORγt is the lineage-defining transcription factor for Th17 cell differentiation, targeting RORγt via small molecular inverse agonists may be a promising strategy  for the treatment of Th17-mediated psoriasis."

Thus, RORγt inverse agonists are thought to be potent therapeutic agents for Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.  Although RORγt has constitutive activity, it is recognized that the receptor is physiologically regulated by various cholesterol derivatives. In this study, we sought to identify RORγt inverse agonists through a high-throughput screening campaign. To this end, we compared an apo-RORγt protein from Escherichia coli and a cholesterol-bound RORγt protein from insect cells. The IC50 of the known RORγt  inverse agonist TO901317 was significantly lower for the apoprotein than for the  cholesterol-bound RORγt. Through high-throughput screening using a fluorescence-based cholesterol binding assay with the apoprotein, we identified compound 1 as a novel cholesterol-competitive RORγt inverse agonist. Compound 1 inhibited the RORγt-TopFluor cholesterol interaction, coactivator recruitment, and transcriptional activity of RORγt. Cell-based reporter gene assay demonstrated that compound 1 showed higher potency by lipid depletion treatment.  Collectively, our findings indicate that eliminating cholesterol from the RORγt protein is suitable for sensitive high-throughput screening to identify RORγt inverse agonists."

Although genetic mutations are progressively delineated, comprehensive molecular phenotyping of ichthyotic skin could suggest much-needed  pathogenesis-based therapy. OBJECTIVE: We sought to profile the molecular fingerprint of the most common orphan ichthyoses. METHODS: Gene, protein, and serum studies were performed on skin and blood samples from 29 patients (congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, n = 9; lamellar  ichthyosis, n = 8; epidermolytic ichthyosis, n = 8; and Netherton syndrome, n = 4), as well as age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 14), patients with psoriasis (n = 30), and patients with atopic dermatitis (AD; n = 16). RESULTS: Using criteria of a fold change of greater than 2 and a false discovery  rate of less than 0.05, 132 differentially expressed genes were shared commonly among all ichthyoses, including many IL-17 and TNF-α-coregulated genes, which are considered hallmarks of psoriasis (defensin beta 4A, kynureninase, and vanin 3).  Although striking upregulation of TH17 pathway genes (IL17F and IL36B/G) resembling that seen in patients with psoriasis was common to all patients with ichthyoses in a severity-related manner, patients with Netherton syndrome showed  the greatest T-cell activation (inducible costimulator [ICOS]) and a broader immune phenotype with TH1/IFN-γ, OASL, and TH2/IL-4 receptor/IL-5 skewing, although less than seen in patients with AD (all P < .05). Ichthyoses lacked the  epidermal differentiation and tight junction alterations of patients with AD (loricrin, filaggrin, and claudin 1) but showed characteristic alterations in lipid metabolism genes (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3 and galanin), with parallel reductions in extracellular lipids and corneocyte compaction in all ichthyoses except epidermolytic ichthyosis, suggesting phenotypic variations. Transepidermal water loss, a functional barrier measure, significantly correlated with IL-17-regulated gene expression (IL17F and IL36A/IL36B/IL36G). CONCLUSION: Similar to patients with AD and psoriasis, in whom cytokine dysregulation and barrier impairment orchestrate disease phenotypes, psoriasis-like immune dysregulation and lipid alterations characterize the ichthyoses. These data support the testing of IL-17/IL-36-targeted therapeutics for patients with ichthyosis similar to those used in patients with psoriasis."

The role of interleukin (IL)-35, an immunosuppressive cytokine involved in many autoimmune diseases, is unclear in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This study evaluated IL-35 expression and clinical significance in psoriasis. Protein and mRNA levels of specified markers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and  real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. Results showed that plasma IL-35 concentrations were lower in patients with psoriasis than in healthy individuals (Z = -6.525, P < .0001). Ebi3 and p35 showed lower mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with psoriasis than in healthy individuals (Z = -5.078, P < .0001, Z = -2.609, P = .009, respectively). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves of IL-35, Ebi3, and p35 for patients with psoriasis versus the control were 0.86, 0.78, and 0.64, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis showed that plasma IL-35 expression negatively correlated with interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, levels of IL-23, -17, and -22, or the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index and positively correlated with levels of transforming growth factor beta and IL-10 levels in patients with psoriasis. Summarily, IL-35 might mediate psoriasis pathogenesis by influencing the expression of Th1/Th17/Treg -related cytokines and might be a putative target in monitoring or treating psoriasis."

In this study, we found that Il1f6-/- mice developed milder psoriasiform dermatitis upon treatment  with imiquimod, a ligand for TLR ligand 7 (TLR7) and TLR8, whereas Il1f6-/- mice  showed similar susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis to wild-type mice. These effects were observed in both cohoused and separately housed conditions, and antibiotic treatment did not cancel the resistance of Il1f6-/- mice to imiquimod-induced dermatitis. Bone marrow (BM) cell transfer revealed that IL-36α expression in skin-resident cells is important for the pathogenesis of dermatitis in these mice. Following stimulation with IL-36α, the  expression of Il1f6 and Il1f9 (IL-36γ), but not Il1f8 (IL-36β), was enhanced in murine BM-derived Langerhans cells (BMLCs) and murine primary keratinocytes but not in fibroblasts from mice. Upon stimulation with agonistic ligands of TLRs and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), Il1f6 expression was induced in BMLCs and BM-derived dendritic cells. Furthermore, IL-36α stimulation resulted in significantly increased gene expression of psoriasis-associated Th17-related cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-23, CXCL1, and CXCL2 in BMLCs and fibroblasts, and IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-17C, and CXCL2 in keratinocytes.

We aimed to evaluate serum level of IL-33, IL-36 and IL-37 cytokines and IL-37 gene expression in patients with autoimmune/inflammatory disease of psoriasis and to explore their correlation with disease severity. Such evaluation further clarifies disease pathogenesis and may be utilized in clinical practice. 47 patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 47 healthy individuals were included. Serum IL-33, IL-36 and IL-37 levels were measured by Elisa and gene expression of IL-37 measured by real time PCR in all participants. The disease activity was assessed by the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). Linear Correlation between interleukin measures and PASI score was calculated. Also sensitivity and specificity of such measurements were determined. Serum IL-36 and 37 levels in patients with psoriasis vulgaris were significantly higher than those in healthy controls and positively correlated with disease activity (PASI score). Serum IL-33 levels in patients were equal to those in healthy controls but positively correlated with disease activity. Serum IL-36 levels were significantly higher than serum IL-33 levels. Gene expression of IL-37 levels in  patients were higher than healthy controls but was not correlated with disease activity. Serum IL-36 and IL-37 levels are generally increased in psoriasis vulgaris and correlated with disease severity. Therefore, serum IL-36 and IL-37 levels may be markers of treatment and diagnosis of psoriasis."

In vitro co-culture of Th1/Th17 cells isolated from different mice with HaCat cells was conducted to  elucidate the effect of Th1/Th17 cells-mediated by NFKB1 on HaCat cells by MTT, wound healing and transwell invasion assay, respectively. The results showed that NF-κB p105/p50 expression in skin tissues was significantly increased in psoriasis (n = 21) compared to the healthy controls (n = 16), as well as levels of serum INF-γ and IL-17. Additionally, NF-κB p105/p50 expression in lesional skin tissues was much higher than that in non-lesional skin tissues of the same patients. In the psoriasis mouse model, NFKB1 overexpression significantly elevated the scores of erythema, thickness and scales. Besides, NFKB1 up-regulated the level of NF-κB p105/p50, INF-γ, T-bet, IL-17 and RORγt, as well  as Th1/Th17 cells in skin tissues of psoriasis mice. Finally, in vitro assay confirmed that the activation of Th1 and Th17 mediated by NFKB1 in psoriasis promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of keratinocytes.

In this paper, we review recent research about how Chinese medicine immunoregulates psoriasis via interleukins, and systematically summarizes the related mechanisms. There are three common pathways leading to psoriasis: (1) Th17 cells secrete IL-17, which is stimulated by IL-23; (2) Th1 cells secrete IL-21, TNF-[Formula: see text] and IFN-[Formula: see text], with the help of Th17 cells; (3) Th22 cells secrete IL-22 under the stimulation of Th17 cells. Clinical and experiment data indicate that TCM could modify psoriasis by antagonizing or regulating interleukin and IL-23/IL-17 axis to inhibit the main pathways."

To evaluate the influence of H-MSCs on MSCs from psoriatic patients (PsO-MSCs), H-MSCs and PsO-MSCs were isolated and characterized. Indirect co-culture of H-MSCs with PsO-MSCs was performed; effects on proliferation and expression of cytokines linked to Th1/Th17 and Th2 pathways  were assayed before and after co-culture. The results show that before co-culture, proliferation of PsO-MSCs was significantly higher than H-MSCs (P < 0·05) and the levels of secreted cytokines confirmed the imbalance of Th1/Th17 versus the Th2 axis. After co-culture of H-MSCs with PsO-MSCs, healthy MSCs seem to exert a positive influence on PsO-MSCs, driving the inflammatory phenotypical profile of PsO-MSCs towards a physiological pattern. The proliferation rate decreased towards values nearer to those observed in H-MSCs and the secretion of the cytokines that mostly identified the inflammatory microenvironment that characterized psoriasis, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), is significantly lower in co-cultured PsO-MSCs than in individually cultured PSO-MSCs (P at least < 0·05).

To aid their discovery, a psoriasis animal model mimicking human psoriasis is urgently needed for their early preclinical evaluation. Areas covered: The authors review animal models of  psoriasis and analyze the features and molecular mechanisms involved in these mouse models. The application of various mouse models of psoriasis for drug discovery and development has also been reviewed and the possible molecular targets in psoriasis for future anti-psoriatic drug design is discussed. Expert opinion: So far, it has been difficult to create an animal model that exactly simulates a human disease or condition. The xenotransplantation model is regarded as the closest to incorporating the complete genetic, phenotypic, and immunopathogenic processes of psoriasis. However, the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced model is the most prevalent among psoriatic mouse models due to its ease of use,  convenience, and low cost. Further efforts to develop psoriasis-like skin models  in mice are needed for the study and treatment of this complex disease."

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated  and expression of three genes were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). Plasma levels of IL-17 and IL-22 were also evaluated by ELISA. RESULTS: RORC, IL-17A and IL-22 gene expression was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). In addition, a marked increase in plasma IL-17A and IL-22 levels was observed in patient group compared to controls (P<0.001). STUDY LIMITATIONS: small number of patients. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Th17 response may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

Recent studies have shown that increased oxidative stress  (OS) and T-cell abnormalities are central to the pathogenesis of this disease. The resulting reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces proliferation and differentiation of Th17/Th1/Th22 cells and inhibits the anti-inflammatory activities of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). Subsequent secretions of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and angiogenesis. Proanthocyanidins are a class of flavonoids from plants and fruits, and have various antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic properties. Numerous  reports have demonstrated therapeutic effects of proanthocyanidins for various diseases. Among clinical activities, proanthocyanidins suppress cell proliferation, prevent OS, and regulate Th17/Treg cells. Because the pathogenesis of psoriasis involves OS and T cells dysregulation, we reviewed the effects of proanthocyanidins on OS, Th17 and Treg cell activities, and keratinocyte proliferation and angiogenesis. Data from multiple previous studies warrant consideration of proanthocyanidins as a promising strategy for the treatment of psoriasis."

T-cells are activated via the IL-23/Th17 axis which is involved in psoriasis pathogenesis. Conventional treatments of psoriasis have adverse events that influence patients adherence. Wannachawee Recipe (WCR) is Thai traditional medicine that is known to be effective for psoriasis patients; however, preclinical evidence is still lacking. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of WCR on antiproliferant activity using imiquimod- (IMQ-) induced psoriasis-like dermatitis in a mouse model. Psoriasis-like dermatitis was induced on the shaved dorsal skin and right ear pinna of BALB/c mice by topical application of IMQ for 15 consecutive days after which WCR was administered to the mice by oral gavage for 10 days. Phenotypical observations, histopathological examinations, and ELISA of skin and blood samples were conducted. WCR significantly ameliorated development of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis and reduced levels of Th17 cytokines (IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-23) in both serum and dorsal skin. Histopathological findings showed a decrease in epidermal thickness  and inflammatory T-cell infiltration in the WCR-treated groups. The WCR has pharmacological actions which regulate Th17 related cytokines suggesting that it  is a potential alternative therapeutic strategy for psoriasis."

The mode of action of FAEs is complex. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature to describe the molecular mechanisms by which DMF and its active metabolite monomethylfumarate (MMF) exert their anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects. MMF can bind to the hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2) on the cell surface and both DMF and MMF react with intracellular glutathione following  cell penetration. DMF and to some extent also MMF modulate the activity of certain cellular signalling proteins such as the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa B (Nf-κB) and the cellular concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Some studies show that  DMF can also affect the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α). These actions  seem to be responsible for i) the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines and ii) an overall shift from a proinflammatory Th1/Th17 response to an anti-inflammatory/regulatory Th2 response. Both steps are necessary for the amelioration of psoriatic inflammation, although additional mechanisms have been  proposed. There is a growing body of evidence to support the notion that DMF/MMF  may also exert effects on granulocytes and non-immune cell lineages including keratinocytes and endothelial cells. A better understanding of the multiple molecular mechanisms involved in the cellular action of FAEs will help to adapt and further improve the use of such small molecules for the treatment of psoriasis and other chronic inflammatory diseases."

Moreover, low doses can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. It turns out that psoriasis and atherosclerosis have a similar pathogenetic mechanism: the same pro-inflammatory cytokines, Th1 and Th17, are involved in both diseases. Aim: To evaluate the effects of metabolic markers, protective cytokines (interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)) and a marker of endothelial damage (endocan) in patients with plaque psoriasis. Material and methods: The study included 24 patients aged 27-69 years (9 female,  15 male) with plaque psoriasis. The metabolic syndrome according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) was evaluated. The laboratory tests were  performed under fasting conditions: C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), uric acid, endocan, IL-10, and TGF-β. After 12 weeks of treatment with MTX injections 15 mg/week, every patient was assessed with the same laboratory tests. Results: After treatment we observed a statistically significant increase of endocan and IL-10, but no significant differences in the titer of TGF-β. C-reactive protein was reduced by approximately 54.7%. No improvement of lipid profile was observed, and even a significant increase in triglycerides was noted. Similarly, no significant difference was seen in the case of glucose and uric acid prior to and after treatment. Conclusions: Methotrexate in low doses in short-term treatment decreases CRP (anti-inflammatory effect) and increases endocan and IL-10 (potential protective  role). Methotrexate is characterized by good efficacy and tolerability in therapy of patients with psoriasis."

Notch1 signaling has been implicated in Th17 cell differentiation and function. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the possible inhibitory effect of Notch1 signaling inhibitor, γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT, on psoriatic Th17 cell differentiation and function in a mouse model of psoriasis-like skin inflammation. METHODS: Mouse psoriasis-like skin inflammation model was established by topical  5% imiquimod (IMQ) application, and experimental mice were divided into control group, IMQ-treated group and IM + DAPT-treated group. DAPT and the equivalent amount of Dimethyl sulfoxide was intraperitoneally injected in IMQ + DAPT-treated group and the other two experimental groups respectively. Skin tissues of the three experimental groups were acquired and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Splenic single-cells and serum were collected to detect the percentage of Th17 cells, the mRNA expression levels of Notch1 and its target gene Hes-1, Th17-specific transcription factor RORγt and its effective cytokines IL-17A, as well as IL-17A serum concentration. In addition, splenic CD4+ T cells from IMQ-treated mice were isolated and treated by DAPT to further measure the inhibitory effect of DAPT on the Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17A secretion in vitro. RESULTS: DAPT treatment alleviated the severity of IMQ-induced mouse psoriasis-like skin inflammation and decreased the scores of erythema, scaling and thickening. HE stain reveals obviously reduced epidermal hyperplasia and dermal inflammatory cells infiltration in IMQ + DAPT-treated mice. The increased  expression of splenic Th17 cell percentage, along with Notch1, Hes-1, RORγt and IL-17A mRNA and IL-17A serum concentration in IMQ-treated mice were significantly decreased when experimental mice were treated by IMQ and DAPT combinedly. Data obtained from in vitro study in IMQ-treated mice also demonstrated that blocking  Notch1 signaling by DAPT can result in a dose-dependent decrease of Th17 cell proportion, mRNA expression of Notch1, Hes-1, RORγt and IL-17A as well as IL-17A  secretion in splenic CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Notch1 inhibition by DAPT can effectively alleviate the severity of mouse psoriasis-like skin inflammation by regulating the differentiation and function of Th17 cells, indicating that DAPT might be a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of psoriatic inflammation."

Cytokines that are important for the development and pathologic function of these cells are potential therapeutic targets in patients  with immune mediated uveitis. This review provides an overview of these cytokines including recent insights about their roles in ocular inflammation from laboratory and clinical studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22, IL-23 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) are cytokines that have been examined for their functional role in uveitis and their relationship to pathologic Th17 cells. Studies in animal models, particularly in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU),  have been instrumental in studying the role of these cytokines in disease pathogenesis. More recently, studies on aqueous, vitreous and serum from patients with uveitis using flow cytometry and multiplex ELISA bead-based methodologies have provided insights into the contribution of Th17 cells and the related cytokines in ocular inflammatory diseases. The central role of IL-23 in determining the pathologic Th17 fate has made it an effective therapeutic target  in systemic diseases such as psoriasis and thereby an attractive potential target for patients with immune-mediated uveitis. SUMMARY: Th17 cells, and their related cytokines, are important inflammatory mediators in autoimmune uveitis. Animal and human studies continue to provide new information to direct development of new cytokine-targeted therapies for patients with uveitis."

The freshly isolated resting mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with different cytokines in  vitro, the expression of cytokines and chemokines were detected by microarray, real-time PCR, ELISA and multiple colors flow cytometry. Adoptive transfer of macrophages and imiquimod-induced psoriasis mice were used. In contrast to M1- and M2-polarized macrophages, IL-23-treated macrophages produce large amounts of  IL-17A, IL-22 and IFN-γ. Biochemical and molecular studies showed that IL-23 induces IL-17A expression in macrophages through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-retinoid related orphan receptor-γ T (RORγT) pathway. T-bet mediates the IFN-γ production in IL-23-treated macrophages. Importantly, IL-23-treated macrophages significantly promote the dermatitis pathogenesis in a psoriasis-like mouse model. IL-23-treated resting macrophages express a distinctive gene expression prolife compared with M1 and M2 macrophages. The identification of IL-23-induced macrophage polarization may help us to understand the contribution of macrophage subpopulation in Th17-cytokines-related pathogenesis."

However, it is unknown  whether DCK influences DC functions. Thus we aimed to explore whether DCK affect  the major immunological functions of DCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary DCs derived from mouse bone marrow cells and spleen were used for examining their general immunological functions, and OVA-specific T cells from OT-II mice were used for examining the DC-mediated T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells differentiation and effect. RESULTS: We demonstrated DCK suppressed DC uptake of FITC-labeled ovalbumin (OVA) and DC maturation characterized by decreased MHCII, CD80 and CD86 following imiquimod (IMQ) stimulation. DCK also reduced DC expression of the lymphoid-homing chemokine receptor CCR7, and DC migration towards CCL21, the ligand for CCR7. Importantly, DCK significantly reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-12, IL-6 and IL-1β by IMQ-stimulated DCs.  Moreover, in the coculture of OVA323-339 peptide-pulsed DCs and OVA-specific T cells from OT-II mice, DCK significantly inhibited T cell proliferation and the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells. Furthermore, DCK treatment greatly reduced phosphorylation of p65-associated cell signaling pathway in IMQ-stimulated DCs. CONCLUSION: These data together demonstrate a potential role of DCK in suppressing the biological function of DCs, and provide a possible mechanism for  understanding the effects of herb Curcuma kwangsiensis in treating psoriasis."

METHODS: We characterized a novel murine model of Th17-driven cutaneous and synovio-entheseal disease directed by T cell-specific expression of a hyperactive Stat3 allele. By crossing R26Stat3Cstopfl/fl CD4Cre mice onto an interleukin-22 (IL-22)-knockout background or treating the mice with a neutralizing antibody against IL-17, we interrogated how these Th17 cytokines could contribute to the pathogenesis of PsA. RESULTS: R26Stat3Cstopfl/fl CD4Cre mice developed acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis of the skin, as well as enthesitis/tendinitis and periarticular bone erosion in different joints, accompanied by osteopenia. T cell-specific expression of a hyperactive Stat3C allele was found to drive the augmented Th17 response in these animals. Careful characterization of the mouse bone marrow revealed an increase in osteoclast progenitor (OCP) and RANKL-producing cells, which contributed to the osteopenia phenotype observed in the mutant animals. Abrogation of the Th17 cytokines IL-17 or IL-22 improved both the skin and bone phenotype in R26Stat3Cstopfl/fl CD4Cre mice, revealing a central role of Th17 cells in the regulation of OCP and RANKL expression on stromal cells. CONCLUSION: Perturbation of the IL-23/Th17 axis instigates Th17-mediated inflammation in R26Stat3Cstopfl/fl CD4Cre mice, leading to cutaneous and synovio-entheseal inflammation and bone pathologic features highly reminiscent of human PsA. Both IL-17A and IL-22 produced by Th17 cells appear to play critical roles in promoting the cutaneous and musculoskeletal inflammation that characterizes PsA."

Cytokines members of the IL-23/IL-17 family, critical in the development of autoimmunity, are abundantly expressed within the cutaneous lesions but also seem to be involved in chronic inflammation and damage of the synovium though, as it will be here discussed, not in all patients. In this review, we will focus on the state of the art of the molecular  features of psoriatic skin and joints, focusing on the specific role of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in each of these anatomical districts. We will then offer an  overview of the approved and in-development biologics targeting this axis, emphasising how the availability of the target in the diseased tissues could provide a plausible explanation for the heterogeneous clinical efficacy of these  drugs, thus opening future perspective of personalised therapies."

Many therapeutic proteins targeting IL-23 or IL-17 are currently under development for the treatment of psoriasis. In the present study, a mechanistic pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) study was conducted to assess the target-binding and disposition kinetics of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), CNTO 3723, and its soluble target, mouse IL-23, in an IL-23-induced psoriasis-like mouse model. A minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic model with target-mediated drug disposition features was developed to quantitatively assess the kinetics and interrelationship between CNTO 3723 and exogenously administered, recombinant mouse IL-23 in both serum and lesional skin site. Furthermore, translational applications of the developed model were evaluated with incorporation of human PK for ustekinumab, an anti-human IL-23/IL-12 mAb developed for treatment of psoriasis, and human disease pathophysiology information in psoriatic patients. The results agreed well with the observed clinical data for ustekinumab. Our work provides an example on how mechanism-based PK/PD modeling can be applied during early drug discovery and how preclinical data can be used for human efficacious dose projection and guide decision making during early clinical development of therapeutic proteins."

However, their involvement in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not conclusive. Pathogenesis of RA is complex and involves various T cell subsets and neutrophils. Here, we aimed at understanding the impact of IL-9 on infiltrating immune cells and their eventual role in synovial inflammation in RA. METHODS: In vitro stimulation of T cells was performed by engagement of anti-CD3  and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies. Flow cytometry was employed for measuring intracellular cytokine, RORγt in T cells, evaluating apoptosis of neutrophils. ELISA was used for measuring soluble cytokine, Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy were used for STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. RESULTS: We demonstrated synovial enrichment of Th9 cells and their positive correlation with disease activity (DAS28-ESR) in RA. Synovial IL-9 prolonged the  survival of neutrophils, increased their matrix metalloprotienase-9 production and facilitated Th17 cell differentiation evidenced by induction of transcription factor RORγt and STAT3 phosphorylation. IL-9 also augmented the function of IFN-γ + and TNF-α + synovial T cells. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidences for critical role of IL-9 in disease pathogenesis and propose that targeting IL-9 may be an effective strategy to ameliorate synovial inflammation in RA. Inhibiting IL-9 may have wider impact on  the production of pathogenic cytokines involved in autoimmune diseases including  RA and may offer better control over the disease."

IL-38 exerts anti-inflammatory properties, especially on macrophages, by inhibiting secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to reduced T-lymphocyte TH17 maturation. IL-38 has been studied most extensively in the context of chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly arthritis, where it is considered an attractive new drug candidate. IL-38 research has entered a new phase, with the realization that IL-38 is important in the pathophysiology of TH17 dependent-diseases (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). In this review, we provide a critical evaluation of several controversial issues concerning IL-38 function and regulation. There is effectively contrasting data regarding IL-38: it is produced in conditions such as apoptosis, necrosis or inflammation, but data is lacking regarding IL-38 processing and biological function. Furthermore, the receptor for IL-38 has yet to be identified, although three candidate receptors - IL-1R1, IL-36R and IL-1RAPL1-have been proposed. Future studies will hopefully uncover new aspects of this enigmatic cytokine."

PSORI-CM02 is an empirical formula of Chinese medicine optimized from Yin Xie Ling, which is widely used to treat psoriasis in China for decades. However, its antipsoriatic mechanisms are still not well understood. Here, we explored the therapeutic effects of PSORI-CM02 on psoriasis and its mechanisms of action in imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse  models and human HaCaT cells. In experiments in vitro, PSORI-CM02 significantly inhibited HaCaT cell proliferation in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners.  Furthermore, it hindered the progression of HaCaT cell cycle and arrested HaCaT cells at G1 phase. On the other hand, our in vivo studies demonstrated that PSORI-CM02 dramatically reduced psoriasis area and severity index scores and lesion temperature in imiquimod-induced psoriatic mice. The antioxidative activities of glutathione, catalase, and superoxide dismutase were increased while oxidative activity of malonaldehyde was markedly decreased after treatments with PSORI-CM02. PSORI-CM02 also suppressed the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17, and lowered their protein levels in the serum as well. In addition, PSORI-CM02 could reduce the expression of IKKα and NF-κB in psoriatic skin tissue. It also upregulated the proportion of CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in both lymph nodes and spleens and promoted CD4+ CD25+ Treg proliferation in vitro. Taken together, our  research demonstrated that PSORI-CM02 inhibited HaCaT cell proliferation by arresting them at G1 phase and alleviated systemic inflammation and psoriasis in  mice via altering the oxidative/anti-oxidative status, tipping the balance between Th17 responsiveness and CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg generation, and suppressing the  expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as NF-κB signaling."

We conducted this nationwide population-based matched-cohort study to describe if patients with a diagnosis of scabies have a different risk of developing new psoriasis. From the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, patients with scabies (n = 5137) were identified and matched for age and  sex with non-scabies controls (n = 19 142). We tracked them for a 7-year period to identify the incidence of psoriasis. One hundred and ninety (0.8%) patients with newly diagnosed psoriasis were identified; 91 (1.8%) from the scabies group  and 99 (0.5%) from the control group. Patients with scabies had a higher risk of  subsequent psoriasis, with a crude hazard ratio of 3.45 and an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 3.03 (95% confidence interval, 2.24-4.11). An increased risk for psoriasis among patients with scabies was observed (aHR, 3.03). Immunopathology involving the T-helper 17 cell-mediated inflammatory pathway may contribute to this association. Physicians may consider implementing assessments of psoriatic symptoms in patients with scabies."

Current treatments are unsatisfactory, with unpredictable remission times and incompletely understood modes of action. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis have identified the imbalance between CD4+ T effector cells, particularly the T helper (Th)17 subset, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key to the development of psoriatic lesions, and therefore a novel therapeutic target. OBJECTIVES: To quantify in patients the effects of three commonly used psoriasis  treatment modalities on the Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subsets, and to test whether  any change correlates with clinical response. METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to enumerate Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subsets in  blood and skin of patients with psoriasis before and after receiving any of the following treatments: narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB), adalimumab and topical betamethasone-calcipotriol combination (Dovobet® ) RESULTS: All patients responded clinically to the treatments. NB-UVB significantly increased the numbers of circulating and skin Tregs, while, by contrast, adalimumab reduced Th17 cells in these compartments, and Dovobet had dual effects by both increasing Tregs and reducing Th17 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The differential effects reported here for the above-mentioned treatment modalities could be exploited to optimize or design therapeutic strategies to overcome the inflammatory drivers more effectively and restore the  Th17-Treg balance in psoriasis."

Mutations in the IL-36 antagonist IL36RN, in CARD14 or AP1S3 provide genetic evidence for autoinflammatory etiology but cannot explain its pathogenesis completely. Here we demonstrate that unopposed IL-36 signaling promotes antigen-driven and likely pathogenic T-helper type 17 (Th17) responses in GPP. We observed that CD4+ T cells in blood and skin lesions of GPP patients were characterized by intense hyperproliferation, production of the GPP key mediator,  IL-17A, and highly restricted TCR repertoires with identical T-cell clones in blood and skin lesions, indicating antigen-driven T-cell expansions. The clonally expanded CD4+ T cells were major producers of IL-17A. IL-36 signaling substantially enhanced TCR-mediated proliferation of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, GPP  patients showed preferences for HLA-DRB1∗14, HLA-DQB1∗05, and HLA-DQB1∗03. We conclude that in GPP unopposed IL-36 signaling and certain HLA-class II alleles may cooperate in promoting antigen-driven Th17 responses, which in the obvious absence of exogenous triggers may reflect autoimmune reactions. This study reveals a pathogenic pathway where innate immune dysregulation promotes T-cell-mediated inflammation in GPP."

ASD has immense dysregulation in immune responses which is thought to affect neuronal system and thus behavior. ASD patients and BTBR T+ tf/J (BTBR) autistic mice have increased systemic inflammation due to dysfunction in innate and adaptive immune  responses. Recent studies suggest that ASD patients are associated with several co-morbid autoimmune disorders including psoriasis. However underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon have not been explored. In this study, we used imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriatic inflammation in social C57BL/6 (C57) mice and asocial BTBR mice to investigate whether systemic inflammation in BTBR is associated with increased susceptibility to psoriatic inflammation. Our data shows that BTBR mice have increased expression of TLR7/IL-6/IL-23 in systemic DCs but not in skin as compared to C57 mice at baseline. This leads to much greater psoriatic inflammation in BTBR mice upon IMQ application than C57 mice. Consequently, BTBR  mice also have higher Th17 related immune responses in the skin and systemic compartment. Overall our study suggests that systemic innate (TLR7/IL-23/IL-6 in  DCs) and adaptive (Th17 related signaling) immune responses are heightened in BTBR mice at baseline which predisposes them for greater psoriatic inflammation than C57 mice upon IMQ application. This could be one of the reasons for increased psoriatic inflammation in patients with ASD. Therapies that aim to decrease immune activation may not only benefit ASD-associated neurobehavioral abnormalities but also comorbid disorders such as psoriasis."

We studied PKCε expression in circulating CD4+ -T cells from patients with psoriasis, a skin disorder characterized by an increased amount of Th17 cells, a CD4+ subset that is critical in the development of autoimmunity. Although the mechanisms that underlie Th17 differentiation in humans are still unclear, we here show that: (i) PKCε is overexpressed in CD4+ -T cells from psoriatic patients, and its expression positively correlates with the severity of the disease, being reduced by effective phototherapy; (ii) PKCε interacts with Stat3 during Th17 differentiation and its overexpression results in an enhanced expression of Stat3 and pStat3(Ser727); iii) conversely, when PKCε is forcibly downregulated, CD4+ -T cells show lower levels of pStat3(Ser727) expression and defective in vitro expansion into the Th17-lineage.

Th17 inhibitors could replace TNF-α antagonists as first-line biologic agents. We determined the overall treatment effect of Th17 pathway inhibitors compared to placebo or active control on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 12 (primary objective), risk of infections, discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events, and serious adverse events during the placebo-controlled period (12-24 weeks) in adults with  active PsA in published randomized controlled trials. METHODS: The SCOPUS database was searched. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for assessing quality. The pooled relative risk (RR) was derived from random effects models. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials were included which randomized 1,718  patients to Th17 inhibitors and 840 to placebo. Patients treated with Th17 inhibitors had an RR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.79-2.33; p < 0.001) for achieving an ACR20 response at week 12 (I2 = 0%; p = 0.89) compared to placebo-treated patients. There was no evidence of publication bias. The result was consistent for study phase and outcome (ACR50/70), mechanism of action and TNF-α naivety. RR of infections was 1.06 (0.91-1.23), that of candida infections was 3.35 (0.75-14.95), that of serious adverse events was 0.82 (0.42-1.59) and that of discontinuation of treatment was 0.54 (0.31-0.93) among treated versus placebo subjects. No incident cases of tuberculosis were reported. CONCLUSION: In patients with active PsA, biologics targeting the Th17 axis produce a clinically significant improvement in joint disease activity with acceptable safety and tolerability for short-term treatment compared to placebo."

Recently, the immunological pathomechanism has been clarified substantially. Whereas T-helper (Th)1 overactivation was thought to induce occurrence of psoriasis, it has been demonstrated that Th17 cells play a key role. Th17 development is maintained by interleukin (IL)-23 mainly produced by dendritic cells. Th17 cells  produce various cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22. IL-17A and IL-22 induce not only keratinocyte proliferation, but also tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)1 and CXCL8 production. TNF-α accelerates the infiltration of inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils, from the peripheral blood into skin with dendritic cell activation. In addition, antimicrobial peptides are overexpressed in psoriatic skin lesions, and the antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, activates dendritic cells, which leads to the development of inflammation. Furthermore, activation of nuclear factor-κB signal induces the expression of keratins 6 and 16 in keratinocytes, which are associated with acanthosis and reduced turnover time in  the epidermis. The progression of the pathomechanism contributes to the development of new therapies for psoriasis."

In mice, under homeostatic conditions, these innate-like lymphocytes are pre-programmed in the fetal thymus, through an  intricate process involving both T cell receptor-dependent and -independent signals, which allows them to readily produce IL-17 upon stimulation. However, given their transcriptional and epigenetic wiring, γδ17 T cells are permissive to different environmental instructions, and can readily acquire the ability to co-produce multiple cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-22 and GM-CSF, that further propagate inflammation. Moreover, strong IL-23 signals, which are abundantly found in autoinflammatory conditions, are able to induce de novo differentiation  of γδ17 T cells from uncommitted precursors, both in mice and humans. This notwithstanding, the exact mechanisms responsible for γδ17 T cell pathogenicity and multifunctionality are still poorly understood, especially in humans. The pathogenic roles attributed to γδ17 T cells in autoimmune diseases stem mainly from their ability to recruit different inflammatory myeloid populations to the target tissue, and to modulate αβ T cell function, either by enhancing inflammatory TH17 responses, or by restraining regulatory Treg cell activity. Given their capacity to link key inflammatory axes of innate and adaptive immunity, a better understanding of the molecular basis underpinning γδ17 T cell  plasticity, and how much this feature accounts for their pathophysiological roles, may be critical for developing novel therapeutic approaches. In this review, we discuss the importance of γδ17 T cells in breaking tolerance and enhancing inflammation in various autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis under the light of their basic biological traits, e.g. development, activation, effector functions and plasticity."

In a co-culture system of human CD4+ T cells with monocytes or myeloid dendritic cells, CXCL4 induced IL-17 production upon triggering by superantigen. Moreover, when monocyte-derived dendritic cells were differentiated in the presence of CXCL4, they orchestrated increased levels of IL-17, IFN-γ, and proliferation by CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, the CXCL4 levels in synovial fluid from psoriatic arthritis patients strongly correlated with IL-17 and IL-22 levels. A similar response to CXCL4 of enhanced IL-17 production by CD4+ T cells was also observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis. Altogether, we demonstrate that CXCL4 boosts pro-inflammatory cytokine production especially IL-17 by human CD4+ T cells, either by acting directly or indirectly via myeloid antigen presenting cells, implicating a role for CXCL4 in  PsA pathology."

In the last decade, technological advances have enabled substantial progress in the understanding of disease genetics. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 60 disease susceptibility regions, highlighting the pathogenic involvement of genes related to Th17 cell activation. This pathway has now been targeted by a new generation of biologics that have shown great efficacy in clinical trials. At the same time, the study of rare variants of psoriasis has identified interleukin (IL)-36 cytokines as important amplifiers of Th17 signaling and promising targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we review these exciting discoveries, which highlight the translational potential of genetic studies."

Ustekinumab is a fully human  IgG1 monoclonal antibody which targets the common p40 subunit of the cytokines interleukin-12 as well as interleukin-23. Consequently, the Th1 and Th17 inflammatory responses are inhibited. Ustekinumab has been recently approved for  its use in patients with Crohns disease. Its efficacy and safety was initially proved in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. More recently, three Phase III trials have confirmed its efficacy in patients with Crohns disease refractory to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. This biologic agent appears safe, with no increased risk of infectious or malignant complications, and a low  immunogenic profile."

Anti-cytokine therapeutic approaches  have been largely developed and TNFα constitutes the main target. Adalimumab is a human anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody that has been reported to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety, resulting in reversal of epidermal hyperplasia and  cutaneous inflammation. We aimed to analyse changes in the skin inflammatory transcriptomic profile in psoriatic patients during adalimumab therapy. In addition, the circulating cytokine profile was analysed to define systemic inflammation. Eighteen patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were treated with adalimumab. After four and 16 weeks, clinical efficacy was assessed using PASI and DLQI, and skin mRNA profiles were determined and circulating cytokines quantified. We identified a rapid effect of adalimumab therapy on a large array of Th17 cytokines of the skin, which may account for the modification of keratinocyte expression profile and clinical response. In contrast, analysis of serum cytokine concentrations was uninformative, confirming the need for characterization of local cytokines in skin lesions. Finally, in non-responders,  local cytokine expression was shown to be unchanged. We show that TNFα inhibition in psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab has a broad effect on the expression profile of cytokines and keratinocyte markers of skin inflammation, which may account for its clinical efficacy."

RA and PsA are heterogeneous diseases with substantial burden on patients. Increasing evidence suggests that the IL-23 signaling pathway may be involved in the development of autoimmunity and erosive joint damage. IL-23 can act either directly or indirectly on bone forming osteoblasts as well as on bone resorbing osteoclasts. As IL-23 regulates the activity of cells of the bone, it is conceivable that in addition to inflammation-mediated joint erosion, IL-23 may play a role in physiological bone remodeling. In this review, we focus on the role of IL-23 in autoimmune arthritis in patients and murine models, and provide  an overview of IL-23 producing and responding cells in autoimmune arthritic joints. In addition, we discuss the role of IL-23 on bone forming osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts regarding inflammation-mediated joint damage and bone  remodeling. At last, we briefly discuss the clinical implications of targeting this pathway for joint damage and systemic bone loss in autoimmune arthritis."

We aimed to identify Th17 signalling genes that are dysregulated in synovial fluid of PsA compared to osteoarthritis (OA) patients and to determine if differences in peripheral blood can distinguish PsA from psoriasis patients and controls. METHODS: Synovial fluid cells (SFCs) from 14 PsA and 9 OA patients were obtained  and stored in TRIzol reagent. RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and purified with RNeasy miniprep kits. Total RNA was extracted from PAXgene whole blood from 20 PsA, 20 psoriasis without arthritis (PsC) and 11 controls. Quantitative RT-PCR arrays were used to profile expression of 84 genes related to the Th17 regulatory network. Fold change differences were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction (FDR<0.05). RESULTS: In PsA compared to OA SFCs, a total of 33 genes were up-regulated and 27 genes were down-regulated. Signalling molecules (such as STAT3, FOXP3) were highly expressed in PsA SFCs, while cytokines (such as IL17F, IL6) were more predominant in OA SFCs after non-supervised hierarchal clustering. Nine genes (MMP3, CCL1, IL17C, CCL20, IL17F, IL3, CXCL5, IL6 and CX3CL1) had concordant expression in SFCs and in peripheral blood cells (PBCs) of PsA compared to PsC and/or controls. CONCLUSIONS: We identified expression differences in Th17 signalling genes in PsA compared to OA SFCs, with an elevation of signalling molecules and attenuation of cytokine expression in PsA. A subset of genes was concordant in PBCs; these may thus be potential biomarkers of PsA."

The molecular consequences of IL-17 signaling in the skin are only partially understood. Therefore, we evaluated the IL-17A effects on organotypic 3-dimensional skin models and observed that IL-17A interfered with keratinocyte differentiation. In agreement with this phenotype, IL-17A repressed the expression of many genes encoding structural proteins. Moreover, genes encoding anti-microbial peptides were induced, resulting in a strengthening of the chemical barrier. Finally, we observed enhanced expression of the three IL-36 cytokines IL-36α, β and γ. We found that IL-36γ was secreted from keratinocytes in an inactive form and that neutrophilic proteases, including elastase, were capable of activating this cytokine. Functionally and similar to IL-17A, truncated IL-36 cytokines interfered with keratinocyte differentiation in 3D models. The molecular analysis revealed strong cooperative effects of IL-17A and IL-36 cytokines in regulating target genes, which was dependent on the proteolytic activation of the latter. Together these findings suggest an amplification cycle that can be initiated by IL-17A, involving IL-36 cytokines and immune cell derived proteases and resulting in active IL-36 cytokines which synergize with IL-17A. This amplification cycle might be relevant for a persistent psoriatic phenotype."

NTP treatment in imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse skin inhibited increases in epithelial cell thickness and expression of pro-inflammatory molecules compared to ones without the NTP treatment. In addition, differentiation of Th17 cells, an important cell type for pathogenesis  of psoriasis, was inhibited in the NTP-treated mouse lymph nodes. It was also demonstrated that liquid type plasma (LTP), which is also known as indirect plasma, inhibited Th17 cell differentiation in vitro. Other in vitro experiments  showed that LTP inhibited bone marrow-derived dendritic cell activation. Interestingly, LTP enhanced PD-L1 expression in HaCaT cells, suggesting that NTP  may inhibit unwanted over-activation of T cells through increased PD-L1 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that NTP may be used in treatment of CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis."

Thus far, the effect of Th17 cells on  osteoclastogenesis via direct cell-to-cell interactions is less understood. In this study, we observed that Th17 cells directly promote osteoclast differentiation and maturation via expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ β ligand (RANKL) in vitro. We investigated the impact of conditioned medium obtained from human palatine tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (T-CM)  on the interactions between osteoclasts and Th17 cells. T-CM effectively blunted  the RANK-RANKL interaction between the osteoclast precursor cell line RAW 264.7 and Th17 cells via osteoprotegerin (OPG) activity. The frequency of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cells in the bone marrow of an imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model was decreased following T-CM injection. Therefore, our data provide novel insight into the therapeutic potential of tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cell-mediated therapy (via OPG production) for the treatment of pathophysiologic processes induced by osteoclasts under chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis."

Evidence has demonstrated that psoriasis has some common features, including immune responses (due to Th17 cells) and inflammatory cytokine profiles, with systematic diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and obesity. Recently, studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiota plays a  crucial role in host homoeostasis and immune response, particular in Th17 cells,  but the role of the gut microbiota in psoriasis remains unclear. To study the relationship between gut microbiota and psoriasis, we analysed microbiota profiles in psoriasis using a 16S rDNA sequencing platform, and we found that the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly reduced in patients with psoriasis. A. muciniphila is believed to have an important function in the pathogenesis of IBD and obesity; therefore, A. muciniphila, which is an indicator of health status, may be a key node for psoriasis as well as IBD and obesity. Taken together, our study identified that gut microbiota signature and function are significantly altered in the gut of patients with psoriasis, which provides a novel angle to understanding the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) therapy is widely used in the treatment of psoriasis; however, its mechanism of action is still not well understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the circulating T-lymphocyte subpopulations in psoriasis patients before and after NB-UVB, to get insights into the mechanism of NB-UVB in the treatment of psoriasis. The severity of psoriasis was assessed by means of the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-score). The percentage of CD4+ T helper, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ CD25+T reg cells and CD4+ CD161+ T h17 cells were determined in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 40 untreated psoriasis patients with moderate-to-severe disease (PASI-score ?12) and in 30 age and sex matched healthy controls using flow cytometry. Psoriasis patients were treated with NB-UVB therapy three times / week for 8 weeks. Disease severity (PASI-score) and T cells frequencies in the blood were evaluated on enrolment (W0) and at 8 (W8) weeks. Compared with healthy controls, psoriasis patients with active disease had significantly higher proportion of peripheral CD4+Th, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+CD161+Th17 with lower proportion of CD4+CD25+Treg cells. Patients demonstrating marked improvement after NB-UVB phototherapy with significantly reduced circulating Th1and Th17 and  CD8+ cytotoxic T cell levels while increasing Treg cell levels with a highly statistically significant difference after therapy (P < 0.001). In conclusion, our data indicated that the overexpression of CD4+Th, CD8+ T cells and CD4+CD161+Th17 cells together with the decreased frequency of Treg cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. NB-UVB phototherapy is an effective and safe treatment for psoriasis acts through the inhibition of CD4+Th  and CD4+CD161+Th17 cell immune response as well as the promotion of Treg cell immune response."

In the last decades, this historical description was complemented by increasing molecular knowledge - and this knowledge is now being  translated into specific therapeutics. Combining the enormous advances made in lymphocyte immunology and molecular genetics with clinical and histological phenotyping reveals six immune response patterns of the skin - type I immune cells cause the lichenoid pattern characterized by immune-mediated cell death of  keratinocytes; type II immune cells underlie the eczematous pattern with impaired epidermal barrier, infection and eosinophils as well as the bullous pattern with  loss of epithelial integrity; Th17 cells and ILC3 mediate the psoriatic pattern characterized by acanthosis, high metabolic activity and neutrophils; dysbalance  of regulatory T cells causes either the fibrogenic pattern with rarefication of cells and dermal thickening or the granulomatous pattern defined by formation of  granulomas. With more and more specific therapeutic agents approved, classifying  ncISD also according to their immune response pattern will become highly relevant.

Conventional, as well as unconventional, γδ T cells are recruited to the dermis and epidermis by CCL20 and other chemokines. Together with its receptor CCR6, CCL20 plays a critical role in the development of psoriasiform dermatitis in mouse models. We screened a panel of CCL20 variants designed to form dimers stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds. A single-atom substitution yielded a CCL20 variant (CCL20 S64C) that acted as a partial agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR6. CCL20 S64C bound CCR6 and induced intracellular calcium release, consistent with G-protein activation, but  exhibited minimal chemotactic activity. Instead, CCL20 S64C inhibited CCR6-mediated T cell migration with nominal impact on other chemokine receptor signaling. When given in an IL-23-dependent mouse model for psoriasis, CCL20 S64C prevented psoriatic inflammation and the up-regulation of IL-17A and IL-22. Our results validate CCR6 as a tractable therapeutic target for psoriasis and demonstrate the value of CCL20 S64C as a lead compound."

METHODS: Immunophenotyping was performed by using the blood and skin of a girl with SR6 region DSP mutations causing erythroderma/ichthyosis and cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: On the basis of the discovery of T helper 1 and T helper 17/interleukin  23 skewing in the skin and T helper 17/interleukin 22 skewing in blood, ustekinumab therapy was initiated. Ustekinumab was also administered to a boy with an SR6 region DSP mutation and ichthyosis without cardiomyopathy. Both children responded despite previous poor responses to immunosuppressants and retinoids. LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients and immunophenotyping in only 1 patient.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors exert an anti-inflammatory action and their most common group is the PDE4 family. PDE4 inhibits cAMP, which reduces the inflammatory response of the pathway of Th helper lymphocytes, Th17, and type 1 interferon which modulates the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as  IL-10 interleukins. The Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis.

Innate and adaptive host immune  responses are fundamental for defense against streptococcal pharyngitis and are central to the clinical manifestation of disease. Host immune responses also contribute to the severe poststreptococcal immune diseases that constitute the major disease burden for this organism. However, until recently, little was known about the host responses elicited during infection. Cellular mediators of innate  immunity used during host defense against GAS include epithelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), which are reported to secrete a number of soluble inflammatory mediators, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs); eicosanoids, including PGE2 and leukotriene B4 (LTB4 ); chemokines; and proinflammatory cytokines. Th1 and Th17 responses play significant roles in adaptive immunity in both murine models of GAS pharyngitis and in human tonsil tissue. A number of inflammatory complications are associated with GAS pharyngitis, which can lead to chronic disease in patients. These include scarlet fever, tonsillar hypertrophy, and sleep apnea, as well as postinfectious sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF), poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and guttate psoriasis (GP). This review aims to present the current state of knowledge on innate and adaptive immune responses elicited during GAS pharyngitis, mechanisms by which GAS evades these responses, the emerging role of the pharyngeal microbiota, and how the interplay among these factors can influence the outcome of infection and inflammation-related complications."

We propose that residual T cell populations in resolved psoriatic lesions represent the pathogenic T cells of origin in this disease. Utilizing high-throughput screening (HTS) of the T cell receptor (TCR) and immunostaining,  we found that clinically resolved psoriatic lesions contained oligoclonal populations of T cells that produced IL-17A in both resolved and active psoriatic lesions. Putative pathogenic clones preferentially utilized particular Vβ and Vα  subfamilies. We identified 15 TCRβ and 4 TCRα antigen receptor sequences shared between psoriasis patients and not observed in healthy controls or other inflammatory skin conditions. To address the relative roles of αβ versus γδ T cells in psoriasis, we carried out TCR/δ HTS. These studies demonstrated that the majority of T cells in psoriasis and healthy skin are αβ T cells. γδ T cells made up 1% of T cells in active psoriasis, less than 1% in resolved psoriatic lesions, and less than 2% in healthy skin. All of the 70 most frequent putative pathogenic T cell clones were αβ T cells. In summary, IL-17-producing αβ T cell clones with  psoriasis-specific antigen receptors exist in clinically resolved psoriatic skin  lesions. These cells likely represent the disease-initiating pathogenic T cells in psoriasis, suggesting that lasting control of this disease will require suppression of these resident T cell populations."

T helper (Th) cytokines in psoriasis upregulate keratin (K)17, which modulates TNF-α transduction, leading to vascular adhesion molecule upregulation and lymphocytic extravasation. AIM: We investigated Th phenotype and expression of K17, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 in psoriasis and anti-TNF-α-related PsoD. METHODS: Skin biopsies from patients with psoriasis unresponsive to TNF-α inhibitor therapy (n = 11), PsoD-related to TNF-α inhibition (n = 9), untreated psoriasis (n = 9) or atopic dermatitis (AD; n = 9) were immunohistochemically analysed for Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th22. Expression of K17, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was also examined. RESULTS: Anti-TNF-α-unresponsive psoriasis and anti-TNF-α-related PsoD showed decreased Th1 : Th2 raio and increased Th17 : Th1 ratio compared with untreated psoriasis. Anti-TNF-α-unresponsive psoriasis had significantly fewer Th1 (4% vs.  12%) and more Th17 (51% vs. 20%) cells than untreated psoriasis. No difference in Th22 cells was identified. K17 was present in all cases of untreated psoriasis and anti-TNF-α-related PsoD, 91% of anti-TNF-α-unresponsive psoriasis, and only 22% of AD. VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in anti-TNF-α-related PsoD was akin to untreated psoriasis, but decreased in anti-TNF-α-unresponsive psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings further the current understanding of the anti-TNF-α-related psoriasiform phenotype and support a rationale for therapeutic targeting of interleukin-17 and TNF-α in combination."

Activation of Toll-like receptor 7/8 by means of topical application of imiquimod is the most commonly used mouse model of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the potential of a human imiquimod patch test model to resemble human psoriasis. METHODS: Imiquimod (Aldara 5% cream; 3M Pharmaceuticals, St Paul, Minn) was applied twice a week to the backs of volunteers (n = 18), and development of skin lesions was monitored over a period of 4 weeks. Consecutive biopsy specimens were taken for whole-genome expression analysis, histology, and T-cell isolation. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were isolated from whole blood, stimulated with Toll-like receptor 7 agonist, and analyzed by means of extracellular flux analysis and real-time PCR. RESULTS: We demonstrate that imiquimod induces a monomorphic and self-limited inflammatory response in healthy subjects, as well as patients with psoriasis or  eczema. The clinical and histologic phenotype, as well as the transcriptome, of imiquimod-induced inflammation in human skin resembles acute contact dermatitis rather than psoriasis. Nevertheless, the imiquimod model mimics the hallmarks of  psoriasis. In contrast to classical contact dermatitis, in which myeloid dendritic cells sense haptens, pDCs are primary sensors of imiquimod. They respond with production of proinflammatory and TH17-skewing cytokines, resulting  in a TH17 immune response with IL-23 as a key driver. In a proof-of-concept setting systemic treatment with ustekinumab diminished imiquimod-induced inflammation. CONCLUSION: In human subjects imiquimod induces contact dermatitis with the distinctive feature that pDCs are the primary sensors, leading to an IL-23/TH17 deviation. Despite these shortcomings, the human imiquimod model might be useful  to investigate early pathogenic events and prove molecular concepts in patients with psoriasis."

The pathogenesis involves T cells activation via the IL-23/Th17 axis. Conventional treatments of psoriasis have adverse events influencing patients adherence. Wannachawee Recipe (WCR) has been effectively used as Thai folk remedy for psoriasis patients; however, preclinical evidence defining how WCR works is still lacking. This study defined mechanisms for its antiproliferation and anti-inflammatory effects in HaCaT cells. The cytotoxicity and antiproliferation  results from SRB and CCK-8 assays showed that WCR inhibited the growth and viability of HaCaT cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The distribution of cell cycle phases determined by flow cytometry showed that WCR did not interrupt  cell cycle progression. Interestingly, RT-qPCR revealed that WCR significantly decreased the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23, and TNF-α but induced IL-10 expression in TNF-α- and IFN-γ-induced HaCaT cells. At the protein level determined by ELISA, WCR significantly reduced the secretion of IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-23. The WCR at low concentrations was proved to possess anti-inflammatory effect without cytotoxicity and it did not interfere with cell  cycle of keratinocytes. This is the first study to provide convincing evidence that WCR is a potential candidate for development of effective psoriasis therapies."

The role of HLA-B*51 in the pathogenesis  of Behçets disease.","The association between carriage of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 allele and development of Behçets disease (BD) has been known since the early 1970s, but the exact mechanisms responsible for its role in pathogenesis remain much-debated. In an effort to explain the disease process, it has been suggested  that BD constitutes one of a newly termed group of diseases, the MHC-I-opathies. Other MHC-I-opathies include ankylosing spondylitis and HLA-B*27-associated spondyloarthropathies and HLA-C*0602-associated skin psoriasis. Recent work analysing the peptidome of HLA-B*51 suggests that altered  peptide presentation by HLA-B*51 is vital to the disease process. In this review, we argue that immune receptor interactions with HLA-B*51 or the HLA-B*51-peptide  complex could lead to development of inflammation in BD. The evidence for CD8+ T  cell involvement is weak, and based on emerging studies it seems more likely that natural killer (NK) or other cell interactions, perhaps mediated by leucocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) or killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)  receptors, are culpable in pathogenesis. HLA misfolding leading directly to inflammation is another hypothesis for BD pathogenesis that deserves greater investigation. Ultimately, greater understanding of HLA-B*51s unique role in BD  will probably lead to improved development of therapeutic strategies."

Immunosuppressive therapy for IPEX patients has been generally  ineffective and has caused severe side effects, however curcumin has shown immune regulation properties for inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases without side effects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether curcumin would attenuate symptoms of IPEX in mouse model and would prolong its survival period. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were separated into scurfy or wild-type litter mate groups  by genotyping, and each group subsequently was separated into 2 subgroups that were fed a 1% curcumin containing or normal diet from the last day of breast-feeding. After weaning, pups were fed either a 1% curcumin containing or normal diet until all scurfy mice die for survival data. To elucidate immune cell proportions in spleen and lymph nodes, cells were analyzed by flowcytometry. Cellular cytokine production was accessed to investigate the effects of curcumin  in T cell differentiation in vitro. RESULTS: Scurfy mice fed a 1% curcumin diet survived 4.0-fold longer compared to  scurfy (92.5 days) mice fed a normal diet (23 days). A curcumin diet decreased all of the Th1/Th2/Th17 cell populations and attenuated diverse symptoms such as  splenomegaly in scurfy mice. In vitro experiments showed that curcumin treatment  directly decreased the Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine production of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17A in CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin diet attenuated the scurfy-induced immune disorder, a model of IPEX syndrome, by inhibiting Th1/Th2/Th17 responses in mice. These results have implications for improving clinical therapy for patients with IPEX and other T cell related autoimmune diseases."

Epub 2017 Sep 1.","Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis: two different immune diseases or one spectrum?","Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are common T-cell mediated inflammatory diseases of the skin that can be treated by specific cytokine antagonists or more broad immunosuppressive drugs. The diseases are similar in that epidermal keratinocytes respond to T-cell derived cytokines by altering growth and differentiation responses, accounting for major parts of the overall disease phenotype. When studied across European-American populations, psoriasis and AD display differing T-cell polarity and different arrays of cytokines. Psoriasis is a disease largely driven by Th17 T-cells and associated IL-17 activation, while AD has a strong Th2 component associated with IL-4 and IL-13 over-production, and both diseases have activation of Th22 T-cells and Th1 pathways with increased IL-22 and IFNγ production, respectively. AD is a disease frequently associated with increased IgE production and overt allergies or asthma, most likely due to increased Th2 activation, which is largely lacking in psoriasis. Hence, psoriasis and AD can be viewed as distinct diseases with differing clinical, tissue, and molecular disease phenotypes, but this view does not account for specific subtypes of AD, including Asian-origin, intrinsic, and pediatric AD, that have a  prominent IL-17 component and also tissue patterning that overlaps with distinctive psoriasis histopathology. Hence, when considering the range of AD phenotypes, a case can be made that psoriasis and AD exist across a spectrum where polar T-cell axes can be variably present and create some overlapping disease characteristics. Today, ∼90% of psoriasis patients have extremely controlled disease by targeting the IL-23/Th17 T-cell axis with IL-23 or IL-17-targeting antibodies. An outstanding question is whether targeting a single cytokine axis in AD, for example, Th2 axis, will lead to disease suppression in the majority of patients and across all subtypes, including those with higher IL-17 expression, or whether it is necessary to personalize therapies and target  multiple T-cell axes to attain similar disease improvement to psoriasis."

To better define serum inflammatory and cardiovascular risk proteins, we used an OLINK high-throughput proteomic assay to analyze moderate-to-severe AD (n = 59) compared to psoriasis (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 18). Compared to controls, 10 proteins were increased in serum of both diseases, including Th1 (IFN-γ, CXCL9, TNF-β) and Th17 (CCL20) markers. 48 proteins each were uniquely upregulated in AD and psoriasis.  Consistent with skin expression, AD serum showed up-regulation of Th2 (IL-13, CCL17, eotaxin-1/CCL11, CCL13, CCL4, IL-10), Th1 (CXCL10, CXCL11) and Th1/Th17/Th22 (IL-12/IL-23p40) responses.

Multiple inflammatory pathways showed stronger enrichment in AD than psoriasis. Several atherosclerosis mediators in serum (e.g. E-selectin, PI3/elafin, CCL7, IL-16) correlated with SCORAD, but not BMI. Also, AD inflammatory mediators (e.g. MMP12, IL-12/IL-23p40, CXCL9, CCL22, PI3/Elafin) correlated between blood and lesional as well as non-lesional skin. Overall, the AD blood signature was largely different compared to psoriasis, with dysregulation of inflammatory and cardiovascular risk markers, strongly supporting its systemic nature beyond atopic/allergic association."

Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory compound able to induce the expression and production of IL-10 and enhancing its action on a large number of tissues. In vitro and in pre-clinical models curcumin is able to modulate the disease pathophysiology of conditions such as pain and neurodegenerative diseases, bowel inflammation, and allergy, but also of infections and cancer through its effect on IL-10 secretion. In humans, at least  one part of the positive effects of curcumin on health could be related to its ability to enhance IL-10 -mediated effects."

Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the central role that the IL-23/Th17 axis plays in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, such  as psoriasis, highlighting its position as a relevant therapeutic target. In particular, the authors start by giving a brief historical excursus on biologic agent development up until the success of TNF-α inhibitors, and continue with an  overview of IL12/23 pathway inhibition. Next, they describe Th17 cell biology, focusing on the role of IL-17 in host defense and in human immune-inflammatory diseases, discussing the use and side effects of IL-17 inhibitors. Expert opinion: The IL-23/Th17 signaling pathway plays a central role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis. Recent data has demonstrated that biologics neutralizing IL-17 (ixekizumab, secukinumab) or its receptor (brodalumab) are highly effective with a positive safety profile in treating moderate to severe psoriasis, offering new treatment possibilities, especially for patients who do not respond adequately to anti-TNF-α therapies."

CD4+ T helper (Th) cells play central roles in the establishment of immunological memory as they assist the functions of other leukocytes. Th cells express polarized cytokine profiles and distinct migratory and seeding capacities, but also retain a certain functional plasticity that allows them to modulate their proliferation, activity, and homing behaviour upon  need. Thus, in healthy individuals, T cell immunomodulation fulfils the task of eliciting protective immune responses where they are needed. At times, however, Th plasticity can lead to collateral tissue damage and progression to autoimmune  diseases or, conversely, incapacity to reject malignant tissues and clear chronic infections. Furthermore, common immune players and molecular pathways of diseases can lead to different outcomes in different individuals. A mechanistic understanding of those pathways is therefore crucial for developing precise and curative medical interventions. Here, I focus on the skin microenvironment and comprehensively describe some of the cellular and molecular determinants of CD4+  T cell memory responses in homeostatic and pathological conditions. In discussing the cellular network orchestrating cutaneous immunity, I comprehensively describe the bidirectional interaction of skin antigen-presenting cells and mononuclear phagocytes with Th17 lymphocytes, and examine how the outcome of this interaction is influenced by endogenous skin molecules, including sodium salts and neuropeptides."

In the IL-23-induced mouse ear model of skin disease, G3 repressed disease development by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in murine ear skin. Moreover, G3 affected the maturation of DCs in vitro, thereby inducing T cell differentiation, resulting in an increased Treg phenotype and decreased Th17 phenotype. This study provides new evidence that G3 might ameliorate chronic inflammatory skin diseases by suppressing pathogenic CD4+ T cell differentiation  and the IL-17+RORγt+/IL-10+FoxP3+ ratio.

Psoriasis is a good example for the resulting most fruitful dialog between clinical and fundamental research. As  a result of this, the key role of Th17 lymphocytes, some of their effector molecules, as well as mediators contributing to their maturation have been identified, many of these being targeted by some of the most effective drugs currently available to treat psoriasis. During this process, it became obvious that major parts of the puzzle remain yet to be uncovered or understood in much more detail. This review will therefore address the search for additional important effector cells other than Th17 lymphocytes, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and mast cells, mediators other than IL-17A, including some other IL-17 isoforms, and trigger factors such as potential autoantigens. This will lead to discussing the next generation of targeted therapies for psoriasis as well as treatment goals. These goals need to comprise both psoriasis as well as its comorbidities, as a comprehensive approach to manage the whole patient with all his health issues is urgently needed.

We evaluated the role of GM-CSF as a potential target for therapeutic interference in psoriasis using a combined pharmacologic and genetic approach and the mouse model of imiquimod-induced psoriasiform dermatitis (IMQPD). Neutralization of murine GM-CSF by an anti-GM-CSF antibody ameliorated IMQPD. In contrast, genetic  deficiency in GM-CSF did not alter the course of IMQPD, suggesting the existence  of mechanisms compensating for chronic, but not acute, absence of GM-CSF. Further investigation uncovered an alternative pathogenic pathway for IMQPD in the absence of GM-CSF characterized by an expanded plasmacytoid dendritic cell population and release of IFNα and IL-22. This pathway was not activated in wild-type mice during short-term anti-GM-CSF treatment. Our investigations support the potential value of GM-CSF as a therapeutic target in psoriatic disease. The discovery of an alternative pathogenic pathway for psoriasiform dermatitis in the permanent absence of GM-CSF, however, suggests the need for monitoring during therapeutic use of long-term GM-CSF blockade."

However, the precise role of CCR6 has  been controversial, in part because no effective monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibitors against this receptor exist for use in mouse models of inflammation. We circumvented this problem using transgenic mice expressing human CCR6 (hCCR6)  under control of its native promoter (hCCR6-Tg/mCCR6-/-). We also developed a fully humanized mAb against hCCR6 with antagonistic activity. The expression pattern of hCCR6 in hCCR6-Tg/mCCR6-/- mice was consistent with the pattern observed in humans. In mouse models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  (EAE) and psoriasis, treatment with anti-hCCR6 mAb was remarkably effective in both preventive and therapeutic regimens. For instance, in the imiquimod model of psoriasis, anti-CCR6 completely abolished all signs of inflammation. Moreover, anti-hCCR6 attenuated clinical symptoms of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced (MOG-induced) EAE and reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells in the central nervous system. CCR6 plays a critical role in Th17 type inflammatory reactions, and CCR6 inhibition may offer an alternative approach for the treatment of these lesions."

In this study, global gene expression of human CD4 T cells activated under Th17 skewing conditions was profiled by RNA sequencing. RORγt and RORα signature genes were identified in these Th17 cells treated with specific siRNAs to knock down RORγt or RORα expression. We have generated selective small molecule RORγt modulators and they were also utilized as pharmacological tools in RORγt signature gene identification. Our results showed that RORγt controlled the expression of a very selective number of genes in Th17 cells and most of them were regulated by RORα as well albeit a weaker influence. Key Th17 genes including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-23R, CCL20 and CCR6 were shown to be regulated by both RORγt and RORα. Our results demonstrated an overlapping role of RORγt and RORα in human Th17 cell differentiation through regulation of a defined common set of Th17 genes. RORγt as a drug target for treatment of Th17 mediated autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis has been demonstrated recently in clinical  trials.

Acanthosis and the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the dermis  were significantly reduced by EKC. EKC also inhibited the expression of IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23, IL-12, and RAR-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) in the spleen, skin-draining lymph nodes, and the skin.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is differential expression of Th1-related and Th17-related inflammatory cytokine genes 1) between psoriatic patients and healthy controls, and 2) between patients with different psoriasis phenotypes. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with psoriasis (10 with guttate psoriasis and 15 with plaque psoriasis) and 5 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. The  mRNA levels of circulating cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-12p40, interferon-γ, IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-23R) were measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The comparison between psoriatic and healthy control samples revealed that IL-12p40, IL-17A, and IL-22 mRNA levels were significantly higher (approximately 4∼6 folds) in the patients with psoriasis. The mRNA levels of these six cytokines in the blood did not differ between the guttate and plaque psoriasis groups. CONCLUSION: We found that the mRNA levels of blood inflammatory cytokines (IL-12p40, IL-17A, and IL-22) were significantly elevated in patients with psoriasis compared to the levels in healthy controls, but they did not significantly differ between patients with guttate and plaque type psoriasis."

This educational supplement summarizes the highlights of clinical sessions presented during this CME/CE conference. A growing understanding of the biology of psoriasis has facilitated the development of increasingly efficacious medications. Skin clearance used to be regarded as an impractical goal for psoriasis therapy. Now, some clinical trials of newer medications report more than half of participants attaining Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores of 90. Two leading investigators  review the latest findings about the treatment of this condition. Recent evidence demonstrates that psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis share multiple pathological underpinnings. A T helper type 17 (Th17) lymphocyte-based pathogenesis, genes, and microbiome changes have been identified in both conditions. Many therapeutics used in psoriasis care are efficacious in psoriatic arthritis. An expert in psoriatic arthritis updates readers about this condition. Cutaneous fungal infections, including onychomycosis, pose diagnostic and treatment challenges. New topical therapies and an investigational oral agent offer expanded options for management. The American Academy of Dermatology has issued new guidelines for the treatment of acne. Appropriate antibiotic use is a prominent theme. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a communication about the risk of unintentional injection of soft tissue fillers into facial blood vessels-including blindness. The lead author of a recent review about this topic  discusses how to prevent this serious outcome. The volume of new information about pathophysiology, diagnosis, therapy, and safety challenges our ability to keep current while enabling us to improve patient care. We hope that the highlights of this seminar offer you information that can be applied to your busy practices."

A total of 189 patients previously diagnosed with PV were selected as the experimental group, whilst 109 healthy individuals as the control group. According to the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), subjects in the experimental group were assigned  into the severe group (95 cases) and the moderate group (94 cases). CD4+ T and Th17/Treg cells were extracted. MiR-200a expression and RORγt and FoxP3 mRNA expressions were detected by qRT-PCR. Concentrations of Th17 and Treg cells were  measured via flow cytometry. ELISA was conducted for serum IL-17, IL-23 and TGF-β levels. Correlation analysis was completed in accordance with the Pearson method. Compared with the moderate group, higher miR-200a expression, RORγt mRNA expression, percentage of Th17, Th17/Treg ratio and levels of IL-17 and IL-23 exhibited in the severe group, whilst FoxP3 mRNA expression and, percentage of Treg as well as TGF-β were lower. A same trend displayed when comparing the moderate group to the control group. We found that miR-200a expression, percentage of Th17, Th17/Treg ratio, IL-17 and IL-23 levels and RORγt mRNA expression are positively correlated with PASI grade, while the percentage of Treg, TGF-β level and FoxP3 mRNA expression are negatively correlated with PASI grade. The results also displayed that the percentage of Th17, Th17/Treg ratio, IL-17 and IL-23 levels and RORγt mRNA expression are positively correlated with miR-200a expression, while the percentage seen in Treg and TGF-βand FoxP3 mRNA expression are negatively correlated with miR-200a expression. Our results provided a strong evidence that up-regulation of microRNA-200a in CD4+ T cells may induce immune dysfunction through Th17/Treg cells and relevant cytokines in PV patients."

DMF is thought to inhibit pathogenic immune responses with Th17/Th1T cells, and IL-23/IL-12 producing dendritic cells (DCs). 6-sulfo LacNAc expressing dendritic cells (slanDCs) are a human pro-inflammatory cell type found frequently among the infiltrating leukocytes in skin lesions of psoriasis and brain lesions of MS. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of DMF on functional properties and cell signaling pathways of slanDCs. METHODS: In the context of slanDCs we studied the role of DMF in modulating cell  migration, phenotypic maturation, cytokine production, cell signaling and T cell  stimulation. RESULTS: Initially, we observed the reduction of slanDCs numbers in psoriasis skin lesions of FAE treated patients. Studying whether DMF controls the migratory capacity of slanDCs to chemotactic factors expressed in psoriasis we observed an  inhibition of the CX3CL1 and C5a depedent cell migration. DMF also attenuated the rapid spontaneous phenotypic maturation of slanDCs, as judged by a reduced CD80,  CD86, CD83 and HLA-DR expression. In addition, we observed a DMF-dependent decrease of IL-23, IL-12, TNF-α and IL-10 secretion, and noticed a reduced capacity to stimulate Th17/Th1 responses. DMF targeted in slanDCs different intracellular cell signaling pathways including NFκB, STAT1 and HO-1. CONCLUSIONS: With this study we identify a frequent pro-inflammatory cell type found in psoriasis and MS as a relevant target for the therapeutic immunomodulatory effects of DMF."

The disease has several subtypes, all  having a common T helper type 2 (Th2)/Th22 polarization, but it also displays differential immune skewing, such as increased Th17/interleukin 23 skewing in the skin of intrinsic, Asian, and early pediatric AD patients. Current systemic treatments for moderate to severe AD are largely unsatisfactory, associated with  significant adverse effects and low compliance. A large unmet need exists for better therapeutics for moderate to severe AD. The translational revolution, first transforming the psoriasis treatment paradigm, is now becoming applicable for AD, with multiple targeted drugs being investigated in trials. The new treatments often have increased tolerability and specificity and higher efficacy  compared with conventional treatments. The clinical testing of these targeted drugs can also provide an opportunity to further elucidate AD pathogenesis by dissecting the contribution of specific cytokines to the disease phenotype. By reviewing developing therapeutics for AD according to their pathway-specific mechanisms, this contribution also outlines the complex molecular characteristics of AD."

Its expression is regulated by the transcription factors NF-κB, C/EBPβ, STAT3 activated by proinflammatory cytokines. OBJECTIVES: We investigated A-SAA synthesis by resting and cytokine-activated Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEK), and their inflammatory response to A-SAA stimulation. A-SAA expression was also studied in mouse skin and liver in a model mimicking psoriasis and in the skin and sera of psoriatic and atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. METHODS: NHEK were stimulated by A-SAA or the cytokines IL-1α, IL-17A, IL-22, OSM, TNF-α alone or in combination, previously reported to reproduce features of  psoriasis. Murine skins were treated by imiquimod cream. Human skins and sera were obtained from patients with psoriasis and AD. A-SAA mRNA was quantified by RT qPCR. A-SAA proteins were dosed by ELISA or immunonephelemetry assay. RESULTS: IL-1α, TNF-α and mainly IL-17A induced A-SAA expression by NHEK. A-SAA induced its own production and the synthesis of hBD2 and CCL20, both ligands for  CCR6, a chemokine receptor involved in the trafficking of Th17 lymphocytes. A-SAA expression was increased in skins and livers from imiquimod-treated mice and in patient skins with psoriasis, but not significantly in those with AD. Correlations between A-SAA and psoriasis severity and duration were observed. CONCLUSION: Keratinocytes could contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis via A-SAA production, maintaining a cutaneous inflammatory environment, activating innate immunity and Th17 lymphocyte recruitment."

We investigate serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in psoriatic patients before and after NB-UVB phototherapy. METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects with moderate/severe plaque type psoriasis were enrolled. The severity of skin involvement was rated according to the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at baseline (T0) and after 4 (T1) and 12 (T2) weeks of NB-UVB treatment. At the same time points, blood samples were taken for evaluation of TNF-α levels. NB-UVB phototherapy was administered twice weekly on non-consecutive days until 12 weeks. RESULTS: The median PASI score significantly decreased from 12.0 at baseline (T0), to 6.9 after 4 weeks (T1, P<0.001) and to 0 after 12 weeks (T2, P<0.001). TNF-a serum levels significantly increased in respect to the baseline after 12 weeks of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: NB-UVB phototherapy is highly effective against psoriasis but, as it increases the TNF-α serum level, it seems unlikely that it can decrease the chronic inflammatory state that is thought to be responsible of the systemic co-morbidities of psoriasis."

Th17 cytokines like IL-17A and IL-22 are critically implicated in epidermal thickening, altered  keratinocyte differentiation and production of innate factors such as antimicrobial peptides. Psoriasis treatment options include modern targeted therapies using anti-cytokine antibodies and traditional non-targeted treatments  like anthralin (dithranol). While the mode of action of anti-cytokine antibodies  is defined, the effects of topical anthralin on psoriatic skin are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to unravel the direct effects of anthralin on keratinocyte proliferation, differentiation and production of psoriasis-associated factors. METHODS: We tested the effects of anthralin on cell proliferation, cytokeratin expression and changes in the expression of antimicrobial peptides using primary  keratinocytes and 3D psoriasis tissue models with and without stimulation of the  psoriasis-promoting cytokines IL-17A and IL-22. Moreover, we compared the findings derived from monolayer and multilayer cultures to data derived from lesional skin of patients with psoriasis before and under treatment with anthralin. RESULTS: Our study shows that anthralin directly induces cell apoptosis in vitro  in monolayer cultures but not in 3D psoriasis tissue models treated with IL-17A and IL-22. Yet, keratinocyte proliferation as determined by Ki-67 staining is impaired by anthralin in vivo. In lesional skin but not in 3D psoriasis tissue models anthralin rapidly normalizes cytokeratin (CK)16 expression. Furthermore, anthralin directly inhibits DEFB4 expression in vitro and in vivo, while other antimicrobial peptides and cytokines studied like IL-6 and IL-8 are regulated differently in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that anthralin directly regulates DEFB4A expression. However, its beneficial effects on psoriasis cannot be explained by direct effects on keratinocyte differentiation or cytokine expression."

We previously demonstrated that Itolizumab, a CD6 domain 1 (CD6D1) specific humanized monoclonal antibody, inhibited the proliferation and cytokine  production by T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody or when co-stimulated with ALCAM. Aberrant IL-17 producing CD4+ helper T-cells (Th17) have been identified as pivotal for the pathogenesis of certain inflammatory autoimmune disorders, including psoriasis. Itolizumab has demonstrated efficacy in human diseases known to have an IL-17 driven pathogenesis. Here, in in vitro experiments we show that by day 3 of human PBMC activation using anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 co-stimulation in a Th17 polarizing milieu, 15-35% of CD4+ T-cells overexpress CD6 and there is an establishment of differentiated Th17 cells. Addition of Itolizumab reduces the activation and differentiation of T cells to Th17 cells and decreases production of IL-17. These effects are associated with the reduction of key transcription factors pSTAT3 and RORγT. Further, transcription analysis studies in these conditions indicate that Itolizumab suppressed T cell activation by primarily reducing cell cycle, DNA transcription  and translation associated genes. To understand the mechanism of this inhibition, we evaluated the effect of this anti-human CD6D1 mAb on ALCAM-CD6 as well as TCR-mediated T cell activation. We show that Itolizumab but not its F(ab)2 fragment directly inhibits CD6 receptor hyper-phosphorylation and leads to subsequent decrease in associated ZAP70 kinase and docking protein SLP76. Since Itolizumab binds to CD6 expressed only on human and chimpanzee, we developed an antibody binding specifically to mouse CD6D1. This antibody successfully ameliorated the incidence of experimental autoimmune encephalitis in the mice model. These results position CD6 as a key molecule in sustaining the activation  and differentiation of T cells and an important target for modulating autoimmune  diseases."

The aetiology of psoriasis  is thought to originate from an interplay of genetic, environmental, infectious and lifestyle factors. The manner in which genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to the molecular disease mechanisms has remained elusive.  However, the interleukin 23 (IL-23)/T-helper 17 (TH 17) immune axis has been identified as a major immune pathway in psoriasis disease pathogenesis. Central to this pathway is the cytokine IL-23, a heterodimer composed of a p40 subunit also found in IL-12 and a p19 subunit exclusive to IL-23. IL-23 is important for  maintaining TH 17 responses, and levels of IL-23 are elevated in psoriatic skin compared with non-lesional skin. A number of agents that specifically inhibit IL-23p19 are currently in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, with recent clinical trials demonstrating efficacy with a good  safety and tolerability profile. These data support the role of this cytokine in  the pathogenesis of psoriasis. A better understanding of the IL-23/TH 17 immune axis is vital and will promote the development of additional targets for psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases that share similar genetic aetiology and pathogenetic pathways."

Mice deficient in interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Il1rn -/- mice) spontaneously develop autoimmune arthritis and are susceptible to other autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, diabetes, and encephalomyelitis; however, the mechanisms of increased susceptibility to these autoimmune phenotypes are poorly understood. We investigated the role of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) in regulation of commensal intestinal  microbiota, and assessed the involvement of microbiota subsets and innate and adaptive mucosal immune responses that underlie the development of spontaneous arthritis in Il1rn -/- mice. RESULTS: Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we show that IL-1Ra critically maintains the diversity and regulates the composition of intestinal microbiota in mice. IL-1Ra deficiency reduced the intestinal microbial diversity  and richness, and caused specific taxonomic alterations characterized by overrepresented Helicobacter and underrepresented Ruminococcus and Prevotella. Notably, the aberrant intestinal microbiota in IL1rn -/- mice specifically potentiated IL-17 production by intestinal lamina propria (LP) lymphocytes and skewed the LP T cell balance in favor of T helper 17 (Th17) cells, an effect transferable to WT mice by fecal microbiota. Importantly, LP Th17 cell expansion  and the development of spontaneous autoimmune arthritis in IL1rn -/- mice were attenuated under germ-free condition. Selective antibiotic treatment revealed that tobramycin-induced alterations of commensal intestinal microbiota, i.e., reduced Helicobacter, Flexispira, Clostridium, and Dehalobacterium, suppressed arthritis in IL1rn -/- mice. The arthritis phenotype in IL1rn -/- mice was previously shown to depend on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Using the ablation of  both IL-1Ra and TLR4, we here show that the aberrations in the IL1rn -/- microbiota are partly TLR4-dependent. We further identify a role for TLR4 activation in the intestinal lamina propria production of IL-17 and cytokines involved in Th17 differentiation preceding the onset of arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify a critical role for IL1Ra in maintaining the natural diversity and composition of intestinal microbiota, and suggest a role for TLR4 in mucosal Th17 cell induction associated with the development of autoimmune disease in mice."

We isolated seven withasteroids from the flowers  of D. metel L and examined their ability to inhibit immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Among the withasteroids, withasteroid B2 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on immune responses comparing B2 with other isolated compounds  from D. metel L., including suppressing the differentiation of CD4+ T cells by inhibiting the expression and production of T cell lineage-specific master regulators and cytokines and directly suppressing the cytokine-induced Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathways. In the interleukin (IL)-23-induced mouse ear model of skin disease, B2  repressed disease development by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory mediators in murine ear skin. Moreover, B2 affected the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro which, in turn, induced T cell differentiation with an increased regulatory T cell (Treg ) phenotype and decreased T helper type 17 (Th17) phenotype. This study provides new evidence that B2 might ameliorate chronic inflammatory skin diseases by suppressing pathogenic CD4+ T cell differentiation and the IL-17+ retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt)+ /IL-10+ forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3)+ ratio. These findings suggest that B2 might mediate the therapeutic effects observed in psoriasis patients following treatment with D. metel L."

In spite of significant advances in the treatment of psoriasis, more effective and safer therapeutic strategies are still needed. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a method of light treatment that is being used increasingly in the treatment of dermatological diseases. AIM: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of systemic 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT on psoriasis and to explore its potential mechanism of action. METHODS: We investigated the therapeutic effects of systemic ALA-PDT in K14-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transgenic homozygous mice, an animal model of psoriasis, which has many clinical and histopathological characteristics similar to those of human psoriasis. Using haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR respectively, we assessed the changes in psoriasis-like lesions, cellular infiltration of T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and neutrophils, and the mRNA expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-17 and interferon (IFN)-γ in the lesions. RESULTS: Systemic ALA-PDT blocked the development of psoriasis-like lesions and moderately attenuated the histopathological changes in K14-VEGF transgenic mice.  Furthermore, systemic ALA-PDT produced an obvious reduction in infiltration of T cells, CD11c+ DCs and neutrophils in psoriasis-like lesions. In addition, systemic ALA-PDT also significantly decreased the mRNA expression of IL-17 and IFN-γ. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the mechanism of systemic ALA-PDT in this psoriasis-like model might be associated with selective damage to abnormal T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and reduction of the inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IFN-γ. These observations partly explain the potential mechanism of systemic  ALA-PDT in psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases."

The  typical skin lesion of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-treated patients is orange-red psoriasiform eczema affecting the flexures, genitalia, scalp, or face, with high susceptibility to bacterial superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus.  When adequate dermatological treatment is administered to patients with skin lesions receiving anti-TNF treatment, the discontinuation of anti-TNF agents is only rarely required. Smoking, female sex, and Crohns disease are most frequently observed as risk factors for anti-TNF-induced cutaneous adverse events. The underlying pathophysiology is still poorly understood, but epidermal  permeability barrier dysfunction, increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfection, and cytokines derived from T helper (Th) 1 (interferon-γ), Th17 cells (interleukin [IL]-17A and IL-22), plasmocytic dendritic cells (interferon-α), and keratinocytes (IL-36γ and IL-17C) appear to play a role. In this review, we describe the clinical characteristics, risk factors, pathophysiology, and management of cutaneous adverse events of patients treated with anti-TNF agents.

IL-19 mRNA levels in lesional skin of both diseases were significantly elevated. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that IL-19 was expressed in the epidermis of AD skin and CTCL skin. In vitro, IL-17A and IL-4 increased IL-19 mRNA expression in human keratinocytes. Thus, IL-19 was increased in the sera and skin of AD and CTCL.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of H4R on these effector T cells in psoriasis. METHODS: We enrolled three patients each with active psoriasis, inactive psoriasis, scalp seborrheic dermatitis, and three normal controls, and compared the basal expression of H4R mRNA in their peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. Then, we identified H4R expression in dermal CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, we investigated H4R expression after stimulating separated peripheral blood CD4+ T cells with several inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: The results showed higher H4R expression in the active psoriasis group compared to the inactive psoriasis group. It was interesting that interleukin (IL)-23, which is a representative cytokine contributing to Th17 cell differentiation, stimulated H4R expression significantly. After adding a selective H4R antagonist (JNJ-7777120) while the CD4+ T cells were polarized into Th17 cells, we observed a tendency toward suppressed IL-17 secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Histamine stimulation influences the IL-17 pathway in psoriasis via  the fourth histamine receptor subtype, H4R, on CD4+ T cells. The immunomodulatory roles of H4R suggest its potency as a new therapeutic target for obstinate psoriasis."

In this review, we focus on chronic inflammatory skin diseases where cytokines using type I/II cytokine receptors play a dominant role in disease pathogenesis and where novel treatments with inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway are already under clinical investigation. To better understand the rationale of using JAK/STAT inhibitors in the discussed skin diseases, we give an overview of important genetic and immunological associations with the JAK/STAT pathway and summarize the stage of clinical development of small molecular inhibitors. JAK/STAT inhibitors will presumably find wide application in dermatology, since they can be applied not only systematically but also topically for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases."

In a preliminary study on psoriasis and PsA we showed that at 6 months apremilast decreased IFNγ+CD3+ Th1 cells and IL- 17+CD3+ Th17 cells and increased regulatory B cells and regulatory T cells. In this review, we highlight recent findings of PDE4 inhibitors in atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and PsA, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, systemic sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. Given the role of cAMP as second messenger in diverse intracellular pathways, selective PDE4 inhibitors are likely to be therapeutic agents for various immune mediated diseases."

We conducted the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for psoriasis to date, including data from eight different Caucasian cohorts, with a  combined effective sample size >39,000 individuals. We identified 16 additional psoriasis susceptibility loci achieving genome-wide significance, increasing the  number of identified loci to 63 for European-origin individuals. Functional analysis highlighted the roles of interferon signalling and the NFκB cascade, and we showed that the psoriasis signals are enriched in regulatory elements from different T cells (CD8+ T-cells and CD4+ T-cells including TH0, TH1 and TH17). The identified loci explain ∼28% of the genetic heritability and generate a discriminatory genetic risk score (AUC=0.76 in our sample) that is significantly  correlated with age at onset (p=2 × 10-89). This study provides a comprehensive layout for the genetic architecture of common variants for psoriasis."

A case series.","SAPHO syndrome is a rare entity with skin and rheumatologic inflammatory presentation. The treatment is not standardized, and in case of inadequate response to anti-inflammatory drugs, the use of anti-TNF or anti-IL-1 biologic treatments has been reported.

We report the results of six courses of IL-23 and IL-17 targeted therapies (3 ustekinumab and 3 secukinumab) in patients with SAPHO syndrome unresponsive to previous treatments (csDMARDs and bDMARDs). With a mean treatment duration of 5.5 months, improvement of skin symptoms was noticed in three cases,  one improvement with secukinumab and two remissions (one with secukinumab, one with ustekinumab). Regarding the rheumatic symptoms, no major improvement was obvious under any of the six treatment courses.

Here we show that a deficiency of the TNF superfamily molecule TWEAK (TNFSF12) in mice results in defective maintenance of AD-specific T helper type 2 (Th2) and psoriasis-specific Th17 cells in the skin, and impaired expression of disease-characteristic chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL17 and TSLP in AD, and CCL20 and IL-19 in psoriasis. The TWEAK receptor, Fn14, is upregulated in keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, and TWEAK induces these cytokines and chemokines alone and in synergy with the signature T helper cytokines of either disease, IL-13 and IL-17. Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of recombinant TWEAK into naive mice induces cutaneous inflammation with histological and molecular signs of both diseases. TWEAK is therefore a critical contributor to skin inflammation and a possible therapeutic target in AD and psoriasis."

We recently described 6-sulfo LacNAc dendritic cells (slanDCs) as immature DCs in blood and as a subset of inflammatory dermal DCs in  psoriasis with a pronounced capacity to produce proinflammatory cytokines and to  program Th17/Th1 T cell responses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate possible immune regulatory effects of the PDE4 inhibitor apremilast on slanDCs. METHODS: In vitro studies were performed analyzing the effects of apremilast on the proinflammatory function of slanDCs and their capacity to induce Th1/Th17-biased T cell responses. RESULTS: Increasing cAMP levels in slanDCs by PDE4 inhibition strongly reduced production of IL-12 and TNF-α. In line with these findings, co-culture experiments with apremilast-pulsed slanDCs and allogeneic T cells either from psoriasis patients or healthy controls, revealed a significant reduction of IFN-γ production and expression of the transcription factor T-bet. In parallel, production of IL-23 and IL-1ß by slanDCs was increased and co-cultured T cells revealed a largely augmented IL-17 production and an upregulated RORyt expression. CONCLUSIONS: We here demonstrate anti-inflammatory as well as Th17-promoting effects of apremilast when studying blood precursors of human inflammatory dermal dendritic cells. In the concert of the broad anti-inflammatory effects of apremilast on keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, the dual effect on slan+ inflammatory dermal DCs should be taken into account and may constrain therapeutic responses."

Current treatment of PsA is mainly based on the use of classical and biological DMARDs; however, 30-40% of patients could not respond to these or have a loss of response. Areas covered: Recently, the discovery of new pathogenic mechanisms have made possible  the development of new drugs that target the IL-17 with the possibility to interfere with the Th17 cells that are considered the cell type mainly involved in the development of the inflammation in PsA. New molecules have shown efficacy  and safety over the various components of the disease in randomized clinical trials. These drugs have been recently approved for the treatment of PsA and included in the newest treatment recommendations. Other molecules are currently being tested in phase III clinical trials and are potential new treatment options for PsA.

Vsir -/- mice developed loss of peripheral tolerance and multi-organ chronic inflammatory phenotypes. Vsir -/- CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were hyper-responsive towards self- and foreign antigens. Whether or not  VISTA regulates innate immunity is unknown. Using a murine model of psoriasis induced by TLR7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ), we show that VISTA deficiency exacerbated psoriasiform inflammation. Enhanced TLR7 signaling in Vsir -/- dendritic cells (DCs) led to the hyper-activation of Erk1/2 and Jnk1/2, and augmented the production of IL-23. IL-23, in turn, promoted the expression of IL-17A in both TCRγδ+ T cells and CD4+ Th17 cells. Furthermore, VISTA regulates the peripheral homeostasis of CD27- γδ T cells and their activation upon TCR-mediated or cytokine-mediated stimulation. IL-17A-producing CD27- γδ T cells  were expanded in the Vsir -/- mice and amplified the inflammatory cascade. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that VISTA critically regulates the inflammatory responses mediated by DCs and IL-17-producing TCRγδ+ and CD4+ Th17 T cells following TLR7 stimulation. Our finding provides a rationale for therapeutically enhancing VISTA-mediated pathways to benefit the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders."

Recent studies showed T helper 17 (Th17) signalling, which is the main downstream immune response of psoriasis, is activated in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients with schizophrenia have higher risk of psoriasis. METHODS: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study, we analysed the 1 million enrollees cohort from Taiwans National Health Insurance Research Database. Psoriasis and schizophrenia were ascertained by International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification coding. The study cohort was comprised of enrollees diagnosed with schizophrenia during the period from 1 January 1996 through 31 December 2010, while the comparison population consisted  of enrollees who had not been diagnosed with schizophrenia during the study period. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for the risk of psoriasis associated with schizophrenia using Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: The adjusted HR of psoriasis associated with schizophrenia was 2.32 (95% CI = 1.81-2.98). After 15 years, the cumulative incidence of psoriasis in patients with schizophrenia and comparison population was 2.82% and 1.17%, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves for the cumulative incidence of psoriasis in individuals with and without schizophrenia differed significantly (P < 0.0001, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with schizophrenia have higher risk of psoriasis, which may be due to common genetic susceptibilities and/or immunologic mechanisms in both diseases. Th17 signalling and pro-inflammatory cytokines may act as a link between these two diseases and are potential therapeutic targets for schizophrenia."

However, the physiological role of the CD1 proteins remains poorly defined. Here, we have generated a double-transgenic mouse model that expresses human CD1b and CD1c molecules (hCD1Tg) as well as a CD1b-autoreactive TCR (HJ1Tg) in the ApoE-deficient background (hCD1Tg HJ1Tg Apoe-/- mice) to determine the role of CD1-autoreactive T cells in hyperlipidemia-associated inflammatory diseases. We found that hCD1Tg HJ1Tg Apoe-/- mice spontaneously developed psoriasiform skin inflammation characterized by T cell and neutrophil infiltration and a Th17-biased cytokine response. Anti-IL-17A treatment ameliorated skin inflammation in vivo. Additionally, phospholipids and cholesterol preferentially accumulated in diseased skin and these autoantigens directly activated CD1b-autoreactive HJ1 T cells. Furthermore, hyperlipidemic serum enhanced IL-6 secretion by CD1b+ DCs and increased IL-17A production by HJ1 T cells. In psoriatic patients, the frequency of CD1b-autoreactive T cells was increased compared with that in healthy controls. Thus, this study has demonstrated the pathogenic role of CD1b-autoreactive T cells under hyperlipidemic conditions in a mouse model of spontaneous skin inflammation. As a large proportion of psoriatic patients are dyslipidemic, this  finding is of clinical significance and indicates that self-lipid-reactive T cells might serve as a possible link between hyperlipidemia and psoriasis."

Genome-wide association studies and metagenome SNPs analyses have indicated that  TAGAP is associated with the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohns disease, celiac disease and multiple sclerosis. However, the precise function of TAGAP remains unclear. Because TH17 cells contribute to TAGAP-associated autoimmune diseases, we hypothesized that TAGAP plays key roles in the differentiation and/or function of TH17 cells. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of TAGAP on TH17  differentiation in vitro and established a line of TAGAP-deficient mice. We found that TAGAP was required for TH17 differentiation in vitro and that the loss of TAGAP in mice ameliorated the clinical features of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, indicating that TAGAP is critical for disease progression. We  also demonstrated that TAGAP interacts with RhoH, an adapter protein that interacts with lck and ZAP70 in proximal TCR signaling. TAGAP competes with ZAP70 for RhoH binding, thereby inhibiting TCR-associated signal transduction. Consistent with these findings, TCR-induced ERK activation was increased in TAGAP-deficient T cells. Because the upregulation of TCR signaling inhibits Th17  differentiation, TAGAP may prevent TCR signaling activity from reaching the limit of the induction of TH17 cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that TAGAP is a novel factor required for TH17-cell differentiation and that TAGAP potentially  represents a novel target of autoimmune disease therapies."

We observed increases in dermal mast cells in imiquimod-induced psoriatic dermatitis in mice accompanied by the expression of epidermal stem cell factor (SCF), a critical mast cell growth factor. Similar to mouse epidermal keratinocytes, SCF was highly expressed in the human HaCaT keratinocyte cell line following stimulation with IL-17. Further, keratinocytes promoted mast cell proliferation following stimulation with IL-17 in vitro. However, the effects of  keratinocytes on mast cells were significantly diminished in the presence of anti-CD117 (stem cell factor receptor) blocking antibodies. Taken together, our results revealed that the Th17-mediated inflammatory environment promotes mast cell accumulation through keratinocyte-derived SCF."

JAK inhibitors are therefore promising therapeutic candidates for chronic dermatitis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the novel JAK inhibitor JTE-052 on inflammatory responses associated with chronic dermatitis, and compared its profile with those of conventional therapeutic agents in rodent models of chronic dermatitis. JTE-052 inhibited the  Th1-, Th2- and Th17-type inflammatory responses of human T cells and mast cells in vitro. Oral administration of JTE-052 inhibited skin inflammation in hapten-induced chronic dermatitis in mice, associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines in the skin and immunoglobulin (Ig) E in serum. In contrast, although ciclosporin partly inhibited skin inflammation, it did not reduce interleukin (IL)-4 production in skin, and enhanced IgE production in serum. Oral administration of JTE-052 also inhibited skin inflammation in mouse models of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis induced by a mite extract, thymic stromal lymphopoietin or IL-23. The maximal efficacy of JTE-052 in these dermatitis models was superior to the conventional therapeutic agents, ciclosporin and methotrexate. Topical application of JTE-052 ointment ameliorated hapten-induced chronic dermatitis in rats more effectively than tacrolimus ointment. Furthermore, JTE-052 ointment did not cause the thinning of normal skin associated with topical corticosteroids. These results indicate that JTE-052 is a promising candidate as an anti-inflammatory drug for various types of chronic dermatitis, with a distinctly different profile from conventional therapy following either oral or topical application."

Further, interferon-γ and interleukin-17A synergistically induced caspase-5 expression in cultured keratinocytes, which was dependent on the antimicrobial peptide psoriasin (S100A7).

Further, interleukin-17A promoted caspase-5 function via facilitation of the NLRP1-inflammasome. Anti-inflammatory vitamin D interfered with the IL-1β release and suppressed caspase-5 in keratinocytes and in psoriatic skin lesions.

Our aim was to characterize the phenotypic features as well as the cytokine and chemokine production of CD1c+ myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in the blood samples of psoriatic patients. Blood DCs were isolated by using a magnetic separation kit, and their intracytoplasmic cytokine production and CD83/CD86 maturation/activation marker expression were investigated by 8-colour flow cytometry. In CD1c+ mDCs the intracellular productions of Th1, Th2, Th17, Th22 and Treg polarizing cytokines were examined simultaneously, whereas in pDCs the amounts of IFNα as well as IL-12, IL-23 and IL-6 were investigated. The chemokine production of both DC populations was investigated by flow-cytometry and ELISA. According to our results psoriatic CD1c+ mDCs were in a premature state since their CD83/CD86 maturation/activation marker expression, IL-12 cytokine, CXCL9 and CCL20 chemokine production was significantly higher compared to control cells. On the other hand, blood pDCs neither produced any of the investigated cytokines and chemokines nor expressed CD83/CD86 maturation/activation markers.

Production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-23 by dendritic cells (DCs) has been shown to promote IL-17 expression by Th17 cells. It is well established that Th17 cells play an important role in several autoimmune diseases including psoriasis and alopecia. Our recent investigations have suggested that Kynurenine-rich environment can shift a pro-inflammatory response to an anti-inflammatory response, as is the case in the presence of the enzyme Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan degradation and Kynurenine (Kyn) production. In this study, we sought to explore  the potential role of kynurenic acid (KynA), in modulating the expression of IL-23 and IL-17 by DCs and CD4+ cells, respectively. The result of flow cytometry demonstrated that the frequency of IL-23-producing DCs is reduced with 100 µg/ml  of KynA as compared with that of LPS-stimulated DCs. KynA (100 μg/ml) addition to activated T cells significantly decreased the level of IL-17 mRNA and frequency of IL-17+ T cells as compared to that of concanavalin (Con) A-activated T cells.  To examine the mechanism of the suppressive role of KynA on IL-23/IL-17 in these  cells, cells were treated with 3 μM G-protein-coupled receptor35 (GPCR35) inhibitor (CID), for 60 min. The result showed that the reduction of both adenylate cyclase (AC) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by KynA is involved in suppression of LPS-induced IL-23p19 expression. Since GPCR35 is also  detected on T cells; therefore, it is concluded that KynA plays an important role in modulating the expression of IL-23 and IL-17 in DCs and Th17 cells through inhibiting GPCR35 and downregulation of both AC and cAMP."

BACKGROUND: T cell derived cytokines play a central role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and contribute to end-organ dysfunction. We previously showed that mice genetically deficient in IL-17A exhibited blunted hypertension and reduced renal and vascular dysfunction in response to angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion. Monoclonal antibodies to IL-17 isoforms or the IL-17 receptor are emerging as novel therapeutics for psoriasis and related autoimmune disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice were infused with Ang II for 4 weeks to induce hypertension. Using flow cytometry and intracellular staining, we determined that the primary T cell subsets producing IL-17A and IL-17F in the kidney and aorta are gamma delta (γδ) T cells and CD4+ T helper 17 (TH17) cells. Monoclonal antibodies were administered twice weekly starting 2 weeks after the onset of Ang II infusion. Antibodies to IL-17A or the IL-17 receptor A subunit (IL-17RA), but  not IL-17F, lowered blood pressure by 30 mmHg, attenuated renal and vascular lymphocyte infiltration, and reduced renal transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) levels (a marker of renal fibrosis) compared to control IgG1 antibodies.

IL-23 is involved in regulating Th17 cells and is a potent activator of keratinocyte proliferation. Targeting IL-23p19 alone may be a promising treatment approach in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, with a downregulation of Th17 and Th22 cell responses, while IL-12 blockade is not required to achieve efficacy in these patients. Areas covered: The authors review and provide an update on tildrakizumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the p19 subunit of IL-23. Expert opinion: Total skin clearance is an important treatment goal that has both measurable and clinically meaningful benefits. Meeting patient needs about total clearance, IL-23p19 inhibitors will obtain a specific position in the crowded psoriasis market. On the other hand, PASI 75 and PASI 90 response achieved by tildrakizumab in the phase II and III trials are less than the response achieved by the IL-17A inhibitors and other p19 competitors, possibly due to a less intensive dosing regimen, although direct comparisons cannot be made without a head-to-head randomized clinical trial. The  main advantage of tildrakizumab is that it is dosed in a maintenance regimen of 12 weeks, and similar to ustekinumab, this is likely to encourage adherence and aid persistence to the drug."

Although distinctions exist between  these diseases, both are characterized by erythematous, thickened epidermal lesions that vary in intensity and affected body surface area. Early models of aetiology attributed symptoms of both diseases to cutaneous inflammation at lesion sites, but recent studies have established that activated immune mediators in the circulation drive disease severity. Activation of T helper 2 (Th2) and Th22 cells in the circulation appears to be the principal initiator of acute AD pathology, with the emergence of Th1 and Th17/interleukin (IL)-23 pathway activation marking the transition to a chronic state. The Th17/IL-23 pathway also has an important role in psoriasis. The role of systemic inflammation in AD and psoriasis is supported by the occurrence of non-cutaneous comorbidities that affect patients, most of which intensify morbidity and disability associated with lesional skin. Atopic dermatitis is associated with allergic disorders consisting of the atopic march, whereas psoriasis is frequently accompanied by psoriatic arthritis. Patients with both disorders are at significantly higher risk of obesity, metabolic disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, all of which feature inflammatory components in their pathology models. These insights have led to novel therapeutics aimed at addressing psoriasis by targeting tumor necrosis factor- and Th17-related cytokine pathways. The success of these agents in psoriasis management is driving new therapeutic approaches for moderate-to-severe AD, including agents targeting the Th2 and Th17/Th22 cytokine pathways."

Whereas metabolic changes occurring during T cell activation are well characterized, the metabolic demands of differentiated T lymphocytes are largely  unexplored. In this study, we defined the bioenergetics of Th17 effector cells generated in vivo. These cells depend on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy and cytokine production. Mechanistically, the essential role of OXPHOS in  Th17 cells results from their limited capacity to increase glycolysis in response to metabolic stresses. This metabolic program is observed in mouse and human Th17 cells, including those isolated from Crohn disease patients, and it is linked to  disease, as inhibiting OXPHOS reduces the severity of murine colitis and psoriasis. These studies highlight the importance of analyzing metabolism in effector lymphocytes within in vivo inflammatory contexts and suggest a therapeutic role for manipulating OXPHOS in Th17-driven diseases."

In this study, in order to confirm and further extend the pharmacological basis of topical steroids in psoriasis therapy, we investigated the effect of betamethasone ointment on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation in mice. In BALB/c mice, topical IMQ at the dose of 250 µg each on both sides of the ear induced marked psoriasis-like skin inflammation within 5 days. The same dose of IMQ produced only slight to moderate skin inflammation even on Day 7 in CB-17 scid mice. IMQ-induced skin inflammation was associated with increased levels of mRNA transcripts expression of signature cytokines of T  helper (Th)1/Th17 cells, i.e., interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 on Day 5. In addition, levels of mRNA expression of the markers of keratinocytes, i.e.,  IL-1β, S100A8, and S100A9, were dramatically elevated in IMQ-treated mice. The IMQ-induced changes in cytokine expression were significantly suppressed by topical treatment with betamethasone ointment. IMQ failed to produce significant  changes in the mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-α as a marker of macrophages  and NK1.2 as a marker of natural killer cells and natural killer T cells. In contrast, mRNA level of a Th2 cytokine IL-13 was significantly decreased by IMQ treatment and further suppressed by betamethasone. These findings provide the first pharmacological evidence that the topical application of betamethasone prevents IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice by inhibiting gene  expressions of various cytokines related to Th1 cells, Th17 cells and keratinocytes."

Dermal fibroblasts secrete certain cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL-1, contributing to the hyperproliferative state of the epidermis in psoriatic skin. Ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy is one of the most commonly used treatments in psoriasis but the influence of UVB on human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) in psoriasis treatment is not completely understood. OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to mimic a psoriatic microenvironment in order to investigate and illustrate the combined effects of UVB, IL-17A, and TNF-α on HDFs. METHODS: The cultured HDFs were obtained from foreskin samples and divided into four groups, as follows: control; IL-17A/TNF-α; UVB; and IL-17A/TNF-α + UVB. Cultured HDFs were irradiated with 30 mJ/cm2 UVB followed by addition of IL-17A/TNF-α and incubated for 24 h. We used real-time quantitative PCR, Western  blot, ELISA analysis, and flow cytometry to examine gene and protein expression of related pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and receptors. RESULTS: HDFs produced significant IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL-1 in response to IL-17A/TNF-α stimulation and UVB irradiation but UVB irradiation inhibited IL-17A/TNF-α-induced IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL-1 expression and downregulated the expression of IL-17RA and IL-17RC at both gene and protein levels. Additionally,  UVB irradiation induced significant TGF-β1 protein secretion and expression of Smad3 mRNA and protein by HDFs. TGF-β1 significantly induced the expression of Smad3 mRNA and downregulated the IL-17RA and IL-17RC expression on HDFs. CONCLUSION: UVB irradiation inhibits IL-17A/TNF-α-induced IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL-1  production in HDFs by decreasing the expression of IL-17RA and IL-17RC on fibroblasts through TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway, which reveals a new mechanism of the therapeutic action of UVB on psoriasis."

GPR43 is one of the receptors to sense short-chain fatty acids, and expressed in various immune and non-immune cells. Acetate/GPR43 signaling has been shown to affect various inflammatory diseases through Th17 responses and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, no study has previously explored the effects of GPR43 activation during psoriasis-like inflammation. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of acetate/phenylacetamide (GPR43 agonists) on imiquimod induced skin inflammation in mice. Mice were administered phenylacetamide/acetate followed by assessment of skin inflammation, NOXs (NOX-2, NOX-4, dual oxidases), and Th17 related signaling. Our study showed induction of epidermal GPR43 after imiquimod treatment, i.e. psoriasis-like inflammation. Acetate administration in psoriatic  mice led to further increase in skin inflammation (ear thickness/myeloperoxidase  activity) with concurrent increase in Th17 immune responses and epidermal dual oxidase-2 signaling. Further, topical application of GPR43 agonist, phenylacetamide led to enhanced ear thickness with concomitant epidermal IL-6 signaling as well as dual oxidase-2 upregulation which may be responsible for increased psoriasis-like inflammation. Taken together, dual oxidase-2 and IL-6 play important roles in GPR43-mediated skin inflammation. The current study suggests that GPR43 activation in psoriatic patients may lead to aggravation of psoriatic inflammation."

Although the effectiveness of several current biologic therapies have described this pathology as a IL-23, TNF-a and Th17-mediated disease, less invasive approaches are still in use and in need of refinement. One of these is the usage of narrow band-UVB (NB-UVB) therapy to deplete specifically intra-epidermal CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells to clear psoriatic plaques. AIMS/OBJECTIVES: In order to improve NB-UVB therapy, we sought to determine whether skin pre-treatment with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) would help increase the efficiency of the former at resolving psoriatic plaques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eucerin® Original Moisturizing Lotion (topical vehicle) or Aldara® (imiquimod 5% topical cream) were applied for 5 days once daily to a maximum contiguous area of 25 cm2 (5 cm × 5 cm area). Patients were provided with sachets containing 12.5 mg of imiquimod each and were instructed to apply imiquimod (I) to two psoriasis plaques (5 sachets of imiquimod allotted to each plaque). A PHAROS excimer Laser EX-308 (Ra Medical Systems, Inc. Carlsbad, CA, USA) with an output of monochromatic 308-nm light and pulse width of 20-50 ns was used for all patients. Punch biopsies of psoriatic lesions (6 mm) were taken at 4 and 48 h after final application of topical treatment with or without excimer laser treatment. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed according to manufacturers instructions and Inmunohistochemistry was used as described before. RESULTS: Our results suggests that although IMQ seemed to activate the type I interferon pathway as previously described, its concomitant usage with NB-UVB for clearing psoriatic skin was ineffective. Although upregulation of genes MxA, GRAMD1A and DMXL2 suggested that IMQ treatment did induce skin changes in psoriasis patients, more optimal dosing of IMQ and NB-UVB might be necessary to achieve desired treatment responses. CONCLUSION: The observation that psoriasis involvement was not aggravated by usage of topical IMQ was encouraging. Additional observational studies might be necessary to further tailor the combination of IMQ with NB-UVB therapy to reliably improve the psoriatic pathology."

Epub 2017 Feb 20.","The role of IL 23 in the treatment of psoriasis.","INTRODUCTION: The IL-23/IL-17 axis is currently considered to be crucial in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Human IL-23 is primarily produced by antigen-presenting cells and induces and maintains differentiation of Th17 cells  and Th22 cells, a primary cellular source of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22, which mediate the epidermal hyperplasia, keratinocyte immune activation and tissue inflammation inherent in psoriasis. Agents that target the  p40 subunit common to both IL-12 and IL-23 have shown robust clinical activity, but selectivity for IL-23p19 could offer advantages in efficacy and safety with respect to anti-p40 blockade. Areas covered: Relevant references regarding the role of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis and clinical trials with IL-23p40 and IL-23p19 blocking agents were obtained through a literature search in MEDLINE/Pubmed for articles published until November 2016. Moreover, ongoing registered clinical trials (RCTs) of moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis were searched through clinicaltrials.gov website, and a manual search was made for pertinent communications at the 2016 American Academy of Dermatology and European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology meetings. Expert commentary: There are potential advantages in selective blockade of the IL23-specific p19 subunit with respect to distal blockade of IL-17A or its receptor. Acting upstream in the IL-23/IL-17 cytokine pathway is likely to reduce the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory  cytokines acting on keratinocytes -including IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22-, in addition to IL-17A. On the other hand, safety data thus far suggest that these drugs might be devoid of some adverse effects of IL-17A blockade that seem to be  class related, such as mucocutaneous Candida infections or triggering or worsening of inflammatory bowel disease. Specific IL-23p19 blockade with high-affinity monoclonal antibodies seems to be able to induce long-term remissions of the activity in psoriasis and might eventually represent a paradigm change in the treatment of psoriasis. The results of phase III and comparative head-to-head trials with these agents are eagerly awaited."

Though, improved survival is due to the developments in the screening techniques, initial diagnosis, and advances in treatments. Numerous factors contributed in the progression of breast cancer, such as inflammation. The most significant factor involved in the inflammatory process, is T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Th17 cells have an exceptional role in many of inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and breast cancer through production of proinflammatory cytokine (IL17). As the collected indication recommends a possible relevance between chronic inflammation and cancer tumorigenesis, it appears that this cytokine can stimulate the tumorigenesis of breast tumor cells. The IL17 family consist of 6 protein members, among them IL17B and its receptor, and IL17RB signaling pathway plays a key role in development and progression of breast cancer, and targeting this signaling pathway or its specific downstream mediators by a chemotherapy drug and small interfering RNA interference is a potentially novel therapeutic pathway for inhibition of this disease.

Psoriasis might be due  to an unbalanced ratio of Th17 cells and regulatory T cells (Treg). The Treg functional ratio is significantly lower in patients with psoriasis compared with  controls and is inversely correlated with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score. We previously reported that bath-PUVA therapy significantly increases the  number of Treg and restores Treg function to almost normal in most patients with  psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: We examined the effects of bath-PUVA therapy on three distinct Foxp3+ subsets: activated Treg (aTreg), resting Treg (rTreg), and cytokine-secreting non-suppressive T cells. METHODS: We enrolled 15 patients with psoriasis and 11 healthy controls. We examined aTreg, rTreg, and cytokine-secreting non-suppressive T cells in peripheral blood obtained from the psoriasis patients before and after every fifth bath-PUVA therapy session. RESULTS: Levels of aTreg, which are considered to have the strongest suppressive  activity in patients with psoriasis, were significantly increased in the early bath-PUVA therapy sessions, and then diminished. Levels of rTreg were lower in psoriasis patients than in healthy controls, and increased during bath-PUVA therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Bath-PUVA therapy induced aTreg and rTreg concomitantly with an improvement in the psoriatic lesions, suggesting a mechanism for the effectiveness of bath-PUVA therapy for psoriasis patients."

Noninvasive methods for the description of pathophysiological changes and drug profiling in psoriasis are desirable. OBJECTIVES: Undertake large-scale noninvasive protein expression studies in psoriatic SC to identify biomarkers of pathophysiological processes and use them  for drug profiling. METHODS: Psoriatic SC was harvested through repetitive tape-stripping. Nonlesional and lesional SC, as well as vehicle-treated and drug-treated lesional SC samples were collected. Protein extracts from nonlesional and lesional skin biopsies were used for comparison. Calcipotriol-betamethasone (CB) was used as a  reference medication. Proteins extracted from pooled tape strips were quantified  using mass spectrometry (MS), Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Luminex technologies. RESULTS: MS-based methods identified 140 proteins differentially expressed in psoriatic SC. Epidermis development, glycolysis, regulation of apoptosis, cytoskeleton organization and peptide cross-linking were modulated, all reflecting perturbed epidermal differentiation. Using antibody-based techniques,  increased levels of sICAM1, of CXCL1- and CXCL8-attracting neutrophils, of CXCL10- and CCL4-attracting T helper (Th) 1 cells, and of CCL2- and CCL4-attracting monocytes and dendritic cells were observed. Quantification of the Th1 and Th17 markers tumour necrosis factor, interleukin (IL) 12B, IL17A and  IL17F in lesional SC was successful, while the Th2 cytokines IL4, IL5 and IL13, not involved in the disease process, were not detected. The pruritic cytokine IL31 was detected in lesional SC. CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10 and sICAM were used to investigate disease remission, ranking three topical treatments according to their known clinical efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Protein biomarker quantification in psoriatic SC detects key pathophysiological mechanisms and enables noninvasive drug profiling in translational medicine settings."

Insight into pathogenic mediators of inflammation is essential for targeted and valid treatment options that could replace previous serendipitous therapeutic approaches in refractory PRP. Objective: To determine whether blockade of the interleukin 23-helper T cell 17 (IL-23-TH17) pathway with ustekinumab represents an efficacious and, based on its proinflammatory cytokine profile, targeted treatment option in PRP. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case report, a patient with PRP received outpatient treatment at a university hospital department of dermatology  with ustekinumab according to the dosing regimen approved for psoriasis. Lesional skin biopsy samples were taken from this patient and 2 others with refractory PRP. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of proinflammatory innate and T-cell-derived cytokines were measured and compared with skin samples from patients with psoriasis and healthy donors. From 1 patient, lesional skin samples were taken before ustekinumab treatment and 4 and 28 weeks after treatment initiation. Follow-up was completed after 6 months. Intervention: Subcutaneous ustekinumab, 45 mg, at weeks 0 and 4 and quarterly thereafter. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was to determine the changes in expression of proinflammatory innate and T-cell-derived cytokines during ustekinumab therapy. The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical and histopathologic phenotype in relation to the mRNA expression profile of proinflammatory cytokines. Results: In lesional PRP skin samples from a single patient, upregulated expression levels were found for most proinflammatory innate cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and IL-1β. Among adaptive T-cell cytokines, an increase of TH1 cytokines and, in particular, TH17 cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 was seen in PRP. The patient with PRP who received ustekinumab showed regression of skin lesions after 2 weeks and almost complete resolution after 1 month. Clinical and histopathologic improvement paralleled the expression levels of TH17 cytokines but not of interferon-γ and TNF, which lagged behind the amelioration. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case report, a role of the IL-23-TH17-axis in  PRP was identified, suggesting a shared pathogenic inflammatory pathway with psoriasis, despite evident clinical and histopathologic differences. In addition, this report provides a rationale for targeting the IL-23-TH17-pathway as a treatment option for refractory PRP."

However, the contribution of MSCs to Th17-dominant immune disease, such as psoriasis and its underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that human palatine tonsil-derived MSCs (T-MSCs) constitutively express both the membrane-bound and soluble forms of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which enables T-MSCs to be distinguished from MSCs originating from other organs (i.e. bone marrow or adipose tissue). We also found that T-MSC-derived PD-L1 effectively represses Th17 differentiation via both cell-to-cell contact and a paracrine effect. Further, T-MSCs increase programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression on T-cells by secreting IFN-β, which may enhance engagement with PD-L1. Finally, transplantation of T-MSCs into imiquimod-induced psoriatic skin inflammation in mice significantly abrogated disease symptoms, mainly by blunting the Th17 response in a PD-L1-dependent manner. This study suggests that T-MSCs might be a  promising cell source to treat autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, via its unique immunoregulatory features. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Released by activated dendritic cells, IL-23 interacts with IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) on Th17 cells, thus promoting intracellular signaling, a pivotal step in Th17-driven pro-inflammatory axis. Here, we aimed to block the binding of IL-23 cytokine to its cell-surface receptor by novel inhibitory protein binders targeted to the p19 subunit of human IL-23. To this goal, we used a combinatorial library derived from a scaffold of albumin-binding domain (ABD) of streptococcal protein G, and ribosome display selection, to yield a collection of ABD-derived p19-targeted variants, called ILP binders. From 214 clones analyzed by ELISA, Western blot and DNA sequencing, 53 provided 35 different sequence variants that were further characterized. Using in silico docking in combination with cell-surface competition binding assay, we identified a group of inhibitory candidates that substantially diminished binding of recombinant p19 to the IL-23R on human monocytic THP-1 cells. Of these best p19-blockers, ILP030, ILP317 and ILP323 inhibited IL-23-driven expansion of IL-17-producing primary human CD4+ T-cells. Thus, these novel binders represent unique IL-23-targeted probes useful for IL-23/IL-23R epitope mapping studies and  could be used for designing novel p19/IL-23-targeted anti-inflammatory biologics."

Ameliorates Imiquimod-Induced Psoriasis-like Skin Lesions in Mice.","Isogarcinol (YDIS), a natural compound extracted from Garcinia mangostana L., has a significant immunosuppressive effect on systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. This paper reports that it reduced imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin lesions in mice. It strongly attenuated the aberrant proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes. Moreover, the expression of genes involving the interleukin-23 (IL-23)/T-helper 17 (Th17) axis was significantly inhibited in the dorsal skin of the YDIS-treated mice, as was that  of the other pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-2, and even interferon (IFN)-γ. Furthermore, YDIS prevented the abnormal distribution of T cell types and suppressed the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells in the spleens of  mice exposed to imiquimod. Interestingly, it elevated numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the spleen and boosted IL-10 expression in the skin. In agreement with the above, YDIS increased serum IL-10 and reduced serum IL-17. It  also caused less damage to the liver and, especially, kidneys of mice than cyclosporine A (CsA). In vitro, YDIS caused more death of HaCaT keratinocytes than CsA. It also strongly inhibited inflammatory factor expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated HaCaT cells. These findings suggest that YDIS is a promising immunosuppressive agent for treating psoriasis."

However, no data are available on whether human CD4+ T cell subsets release EVs containing different pattern of  microRNAs. The present work aimed at filling this gap by assessing the microRNA content in EVs released upon in vitro T cell receptor stimulation of Th1, Th17, and T regulatory (Treg) cells. Our results indicate that EVs released by Treg cells are significantly different compared with those released by the other subsets. In particular, miR-146a-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-21-5p are enriched, whereas miR-106a-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-19a-3p are depleted in Treg-derived EVs. The in vitro identified EV-associated microRNA signature was increased in serum of autoimmune patients with psoriasis and returned to healthy levels upon effective treatment with etanercept, a biological drug targeting the TNF pathway  and suppressing inflammation. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed an over-representation of genes relevant for T cell activation, such as CD40L, IRAK1, IRAK2, STAT1, and c-Myb in the list of validated targets of Treg-derived EV miRNAs. At functional level, Treg-derived (but not Th1/Th17-derived) EVs inhibited CD4+ T cell proliferation and suppressed two relevant targets of miR-146a-5p: STAT1 and IRAK2. In conclusion, our work identified the miRNAs specifically released by different human CD4+ T cell subsets and started to unveil the potential use of their quantity in human serum to mark the pathological elicitation of these cells in vivo and their biological effect in cell to cell communication during the adaptive immune response."

Along  with well-documented genetic and environmental factors, immunological factors also contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Among the immunological factors, CD6 - dependent T-cell proliferation to form Th1 and Th17 cells play a major role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Itolizumab is the first humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which selectively targets CD6. Areas covered: The current article presents the pharmacology of itolizumab and provides a review of  the currently available data on the efficacy and safety of itolizumab for management of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Expert opinion: The use of biologics to attenuate the immune-mediated pathological events in psoriasis is a  relatively well-established clinical practice. However, the safety and efficacy of biologics continues to be an unsettled topic of ongoing research. While available data seems to suggest that itolizumab may be a safer option, additional studies with higher sample sizes and active comparators are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn on the place of itolizumab in the management  of psoriasis."

A causal therapy leading to permanent cure is not available, and current treatments only lead to limited amelioration, and therefore new therapeutic targets need to be identified. Recent works demonstrated a predominant role of TH17 cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis; yet the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the development of the disease are still largely elusive. Several mouse models of psoriasis including drug-induced models (topical application of imiquimod to the  skin) and genetically engineered mice (constitutive activation of epidermal STAT3, epidermal deletion of JunB/c-Jun, and epidermal overexpression of Tie2) have been used to study the pathophysiology of the disease; however such models cannot fully recapitulate all molecular and cellular pathways occurring in human  psoriasis. Xenotransplantation of human pre-psoriatic skin onto immunodeficient mice and triggering its conversion into a psoriatic plaque is the best model to dissect the mechanisms occurring during the development of human psoriasis. One model is based on the transplantation of human pre-psoriatic skin onto SCID mice  followed by the transfer of activated autologous T cells. The ex vivo activation  of T cells required to induce the psoriatic conversion of the graft limits the study of early events in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Another model is based on transplantation of human pre-psoriatic skin onto AGR129 mice. In this model, the  skin grafting is sufficient to activate human cells contained in the graft and trigger the conversion of the graft into a psoriatic skin, without the need of transferring activated T cells. Here we review the methodological aspects of this model and illustrate how this model can be used to dissect early events of psoriasis pathogenesis."

Several proinflammatory cytokines contribute to formation and maintenance  of psoriatic plaque. The Th1/Th17 pathways and some of IL-1 family members were involved in psoriasis pathogenesis and could contribute to disease activity. Therefore, we sought to analyse skin transcript levels of IL17A, IL22, RORC, IL8, IFNG, IL33, IL36A, FOXP3, and IL10 and correlate with clinic of patients with plaque-type psoriasis. In order to conduct that, we collected punch biopsies from lesional skin and obtained tissue RNA. After reverse transcription, qRT-PCR quantified the relative mRNA expression. The main results revealed increased transcripts levels of IL17A, IFNG, and FOXP3 in moderate-severe patients. Despite this, only IL17A can increase the chance to worsen disease severity. We also observed many significant positive correlations between each transcript. In conclusion, IL17A is elevated in lesional skin from psoriasis patients and plays  crucial role in disease severity."

Certain allelic variants of these cytokine genes may alter Th1/Th17 and Th2/T-reg balance and may be associated with the risk of psoriasis.  Hence we aimed to determine the association of IL-4 (rs2243250), IL-10 (rs1800871 and rs1800896) and FOXP3 (rs3761548) gene polymorphisms with risk of psoriasis in South Indian Tamils. METHODS: A total of 360 cases of psoriasis and 360 healthy controls were recruited. The polymorphism in IL-4 (rs2243250) & IL-10 (rs1800871) were typed by ARMS-PCR and IL-10 (rs1800896) & FOXP3 (rs3761548) were typed by TaqMan 5allele  discrimination assay. RESULTS: We observed that IL-4 (rs2243250) had a reduced risk of psoriasis, while the IL-10 (rs1800871) conferred an increased susceptibility to psoriasis, as compared with controls. However, IL-10 (rs1800896) and FOXP3 (rs3761548) gene polymorphisms were not associated with psoriasis risk. The plasma IL-4 levels was not different between the cases and controls, however the heterozygous CT genotype demonstrated significant high IL-4 levels. Plasma IL-10 levels were significantly increased in cases compared to controls, however none of the genotypes were associated with the plasma IL-10 levels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that IL-4 (rs2243250) polymorphism is protective  against psoriasis, while IL-10 (rs1800871) polymorphism confers increased risk of psoriasis in South Indian Tamils. Detection of these genetic variants as predictive risk factors may lead to the selection of patient-tailored therapy to  maximize the effectiveness of therapy."

RORγT was initially identified as a transcription factor required for thymopoiesis by maintaining survival of CD4+CD8+ (DP) thymocytes. While RORγ antagonists are currently being developed to treat autoimmunity, it remains unclear how RORγT inhibition may impact thymocyte  development. In this study, we show that in addition to regulating DP thymocytes  survival, RORγT also controls genes that regulate thymocyte migration, proliferation, and T cell receptor (TCR)α selection. Strikingly, pharmacological  inhibition of RORγ skews TCRα gene rearrangement, limits T cell repertoire diversity, and inhibits development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Thus, targeting RORγT not only inhibits Th17 cell development and function but also fundamentally alters thymic-emigrant recognition of self and foreign antigens. The analysis of RORγ inhibitors has allowed us to gain a broader perspective of the diverse function of RORγT and its impact on T cell biology."

Recently psoriatic inflammation has been shown to be associated with asthma. However, no study has previously explored how psoriatic inflammation affects airway inflammation. Therefore, this study investigated the  effect of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriatic inflammation on cockroach extract (CE)-induced airway inflammation in murine models. Mice were subjected to topical and intranasal administration of IMQ and CE to develop psoriatic and airway inflammation respectively. Various analyses in lung/spleen related to inflammation, Th17/Th2/Th1 cell immune responses, and their signature cytokines/transcription factors were carried out. Psoriatic inflammation in allergic mice was associated with increased airway inflammation with concurrent increase in Th2/Th17 cells/signature cytokines/transcription factors. Splenic CD4+ T and CD11c+ dendritic cells in psoriatic mice had increased STAT3/RORC and  IL-23 mRNA expression respectively. This led us to explore the effect of systemic IL-23/STAT3 signaling on airway inflammation. Topical application of STA-21, a small molecule STAT3 inhibitor significantly reduced airway inflammation in allergic mice having psoriatic inflammation. On the other hand, adoptive transfer of IL-23-treated splenic CD4+ T cells from allergic mice into naive recipient mice produced mixed neutrophilic/eosinophilic airway inflammation similar to allergic mice with psoriatic inflammation. Our data suggest that systemic IL-23/STAT3 axis is responsible for enhanced airway inflammation during psoriasis. The current study also suggests that only anti-asthma therapy may not  be sufficient to alleviate airway inflammatory burden in asthmatics with psoriasis."

Interleukin (IL)-27 is a novel member of the IL-6/IL-12 cytokine family, which plays a versatile role in the differentiation and function of distinct T cell subsets. Previous studies uncovered that IL-27 promoted the onset of psoriasis through enhancing the differentiation of T helper (Th) 1 cells. However, the role of IL-27 in other psoriasis-related Th lineages,  especially Th17 cells, remains elusive. OBJECTS: The study aimed to investigate the role of IL-27 in the progression of psoriasis and its underlying mechanisms, particularly its influence on Th1 and Th17. METHODS: IL-27 and IL-27 receptor α (IL-27Rα) expressions in normal and lesional  skin were determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Serum levels of IL-27 and IL-10 were measured by ELISA. Expression levels of IL-27 and  IL-27 receptor (IL-27R) mRNA in the skin tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (PBMC) were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. To explore the function of IL-27 in vivo, we used imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis mouse model. We treated mice with IL-27 or its antagonist, evaluated disease severity and detected the cytokine secretion from splenic CD4+ T cells by flow cytometric analysis and the expression levels of IL-17 and IFN-γ in serum and skin lesion. RESULTS: The expression levels of IL-27 and IL-27Rα were significantly reduced in the moderate-to-severe psoriatic lesions, along with a consistent decrease in serum IL-27 levels, compared with those of healthy control subjects. Moreover, subcutaneous administration of IL-27 recombinant protein lessened severity of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like cutaneous lesions, whereas IL-27p28 antagonist exaggerated the disease severity. Further analysis revealed that IL-27 significantly repressed IL-17 secretion from CD4+ T lymphocytes. Also administration of IL-27 decreased IL-17A level while IL-27p28 antagonist increased IL-17A level in serum and psoriasis-like lesion in the IMQ-treated mice. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that IL-27 might predominantly play a protective  role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis through abrogating Th17 differentiation. The potential therapeutic benefit of harnessing IL-27 in treating psoriasis awaits future investigation."

Its pathophysiology is complex and involves a skin compartment with epidermal and immune cells which produce cytokines, e.g. belonging to the IL-23-Th17-cell axis. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most common therapeutics used in cutaneous inflammatory disorders and GC-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) has emerged as a mediator of GCs due to its anti-inflammatory actions, theoretically  lacking GC side-effects. We evaluated whether GILZ may provide a better therapeutic index in comparison to GCs during the onset and progression of psoriasis by generating and characterizing a mouse model with generalized overexpression of this protein (GILZ-Tg mice) and the imiquimod (IMQ) psoriasis model. Unexpectedly, in GILZ-Tg mice, the severity of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like  skin lesions as well as induction of cytokines commonly up-regulated in human psoriasis (Il-17, Il-22, Il-23, Il-6, S100a8/a9, and Stat3) was significantly more pronounced relative to GILZ-Wt mice. The increased susceptibility to IMQ-induced psoriasis of GILZ-Tg mice was significantly associated with skin-specific over-activation of TGF-β1-mediated signaling via SMAD2/3. Our findings demonstrate that GILZ may behave as pro-inflammatory protein in certain  tissues and that, similar to prolonged GC therapy, GILZ as an alternative treatment for psoriasis may also have adverse effects."

Retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma t (RORγt) is required for Th17 differentiation and IL-17 production in adaptive and innate immune cells. We identified JNJ-54271074, a potent and highly-selective RORγt inverse agonist, which dose-dependently inhibited RORγt-driven transcription, decreased co-activator binding and promoted interaction with co-repressor protein. This compound selectively blocked Th17 differentiation, significantly reduced IL-17A production from memory T cells, and decreased IL-17A- and IL-22-producing human and murine γδ and NKT cells. In a murine collagen-induced arthritis model, JNJ-54271074 dose-dependently suppressed joint inflammation. Furthermore, JNJ-54271074 suppressed IL-17A production in human PBMC from rheumatoid arthritis patients. RORγt-deficient mice showed decreased IL-23-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation and cytokine gene expression, consistent with dose-dependent inhibition in wild-type mice through oral dosing of JNJ-54271074. In a translational model of human psoriatic epidermal cells and  skin-homing T cells, JNJ-54271074 selectively inhibited streptococcus extract-induced IL-17A and IL-17F.

Betamethasone monotherapy had less effect. Expression of FoxP3 in both skin and PBMCs was down-regulated by calcipotriol/betamethasone, but not by betamethasone. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that calcipotriol/betamethasone reduced the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and Tregs in psoriatic lesions more than betamethasone. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that calcipotriol/betamethasone decreased the numbers of circulating CD8+ T cells, Tregs, skin-homing Th17 memory cells and Th22 memory cells, while betamethasone had little or no effect. Glucocorticoid receptors GRα and GRß were expressed in psoriatic skin.

There is growing evidence that the IL-23/Th17 axis plays a critical role in development of the disease. It was recently shown that in addition to CD4+ Th17 cells, various IL-17-producing cell subsets such as CD8+ Tc17 cells, dermal γδ T  cells, and innate lymphoid cells are also involved in the development of psoriatic inflammation in humans. OBJECTIVE: To investigate which subsets of IL-17-producing cells are involved in  psoriasis-like skin inflammation in a TPA (tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-induced K14.Stat3C mouse model. METHOD: Skin-infiltrating cells were isolated from inflamed lesions of TPA-treated K14.Stat3C transgenic mice, and analyzed for IL-17 producing cell subsets by flow cytometry. RESULTS: We observed significantly increased numbers of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and dermal γδ T cells in TPA-induced skin lesions of K14.Stat3C mice. Additionally, we found that another IL-17-producing T cell subset, αβ-TCR+ CD4CD8 double negative T cells (DN αβ T cells), was also increased in lesional skin. These IL-17-producing DN αβ T cells are NK1.1 negative, suggesting they are not natural killer T cells or mucosal associated invariant T cells. As well as other IL-17-producing cells, DN αβ T cells in the inflamed skin can also respond to IL-23 stimulation to produce IL-17. It is also  suggested that DN αβ T cells may express retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t and CC chemokine receptor 6. CONCLUSION: In TPA-induced lesional skin of K14.Stat3C mice, IL-17-producing CD4+ Th17 cells, CD8+ Tc17 cells, dermal γδ T cells and TCR- cells probably containing ILCs all participated in skin inflammation, which is similar to human clinical psoriatic features. Furthermore, we showed for the first time the possibility that an IL-17-producing DN αβ T cell subset is also involved in psoriatic inflammation."

The histamine H4 receptor (HRH4) is functionally expressed on Th17 cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) which play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. On pDCs a higher basal expression level of the HRH4 in psoriasis patients compared to healthy controls has been detected. The functional relationship between predisposing genetic variations in the HRH4 gene and psoriasis is yet not known. The aim of the study was to evaluate a possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HRH4 gene primarily in the promotor region and incidence, severity as well as special clinical features (nail involvement, arthritis, palmoplantar location) of psoriasis. For this approach genomic DNA from 206 patients with psoriasis and 213 healthy controls of Caucasian origin was extracted and three SNPs in the promotor region and one SNP located in an intron of the HRH4 gene were analysed by PCR and pyrophosphate DNA-sequencing. The genotype distributions and allele frequencies between the different groups were compared by chi-square test. The analysis of association between HRH4 polymorphisms and psoriasis was assessed by odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. The genotype distributions and allele frequencies of the four SNPs in the HRH4 gene did not show obvious differences between the whole group of psoriasis patients and healthy controls. However, there were differences by trend in subgroup analysis: The mutant genotypes (A/G) of rs17203314 and (G/A) of rs615283 were more frequent in patients with severe psoriasis PASI≥30 (34.8% and 34.8%) when compared to the control groups (23.5% and 27.2%), respectively. The mutant G/A genotype of rs615283 was significantly more frequent in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis PASI≥10 when compared to mild psoriasis PASI<10 (33.3% vs 21.7%, p=0.022). For rs524149 and rs17797945  the wildtype CC genotype was more frequent by trend in moderately-to-severely affected patients with PASI≥10 (85.2% and 63.0%) when compared to the group with  mild psoriasis PASI<10 (77.0% and 49.4%), respectively. Furthermore, a significant association of rs615283 with psoriasis palmoplantaris was detected. In conclusion our study suggests that genetic variations within the HRH4 gene might be associated with special clinical features of psoriasis. Further studies  are needed in larger study populations to confirm the reported associations and investigate the functional relevance of the identified SNPs."

Thermal stability shift assay was used to evaluate the effects of the compounds on protein stability. RESULTS: A total of 27 derivatives were designed and synthesized. Among them, the compound 22b was identified as the most potent RORc inverse agonist. Its IC50 values were 2.39 μmol/L in AlphaScreen assay, and 0.82 μmol/L in inhibition of the cell-based luciferase reporter activity. Furthermore, the compound 22b displayed a 120-fold selectivity for RORc over other nuclear receptors.

The presence of cutaneous psoriasis is important for correct and early diagnosis of PsA, because the onset of cutaneous lesions usually precedes the appearance of joint manifestation. Thus, dermatologists are able to  detect the condition at its inception. PsA has several unique characteristics such as enthesopathy, dactylitis, and abnormal bone remodeling. In particular, dactylitis occurs on the easily observed sites such as digits, and is thus a significant indicator of PsA. It is important to observe not only the fingers but also the toes, because dactylitis involves both digits of the hands and feet. Recently, new ideas regarding the involvement of the interleukin (IL)-23/Th17 axis have emerged, and the dramatic effects of targeting therapies have highlighted the physiological roles of key cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-17A, and IL-23 in psoriasis. As recent insights are shedding light on the pathogenesis of PsA, understanding of the pathogenesis of dactylitis and enthesitis are also progressing. In this article, current views on the optimal management of dactylitis are discussed."

Given  the remarkable success of its therapeutic inhibition in psoriasis, the pathogenic role of this cytokine is being explored in other immune-mediated diseases. Interestingly, IL-17 is linked to particular skin conditions where its activation coincides with disease flares. The leading hypothesis for its contribution to proinflammatory signalling cascades is driving inflammasome activation. However,  IL-17 stimulation also releases a range of noninflammasome-related cytokines from human skin. Furthermore, a role in cytotoxic responses and an important interplay with the microbiome is hypothesized. While treatment failure would be surprising  in neutrophilic dermatoses, the picture might be more complex in lymphocyte-mediated conditions. Nonetheless, increasing insights into the pathogenesis suggest that beneficial responses are also probable in the latter conditions. Study of this pathway in the skin reveals some intriguing aspects of  the IL-17-related immunological network."

To investigate the genetic susceptibility in T helper type 17 (Th17) cell signal transduction pathways for promoting psoriasis,  we performed candidate gene and linkage disequilibrium analysis. In 208 patients  and 266 normal controls, we analysed 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 12 genes (CAMP, IL17A, IL17F, IL17RA, IL22, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, STAT3, TLR7, TLR9 and  TYK2; abbreviations: CAMP, human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide; STAT-3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TYK2, tyrosine kinase 2). Patients with psoriasis showed a strong association for IL17F rs763780 [odds ratio (OR) = 3·27, P = 0·04], which results in a histidine-to-arginine substitution, and JAK2 rs2274471 (OR = 2·66, P = 0·02). In  addition, JAK2 rs7849191 showed a protective pattern, met the significance threshold (OR = 0·77, P = 0·05) and showed a tendency for an inverse association  with the frequency of early-onset psoriasis under age 40 years (P = 0·07). In haplotype analysis, JAK1 rs310241A/rs2780889T showed a protective effect (OR = 0·73, P = 0·03) in psoriasis. In conclusion, we report two new psoriasis-susceptibility loci, in IL17F and JAK2, as well as a newly identified late-onset associated protective JAK2 locus and a protective JAK1 haplotype in the Korean population."

Therapeutic implications of TNF-α inhibitors on differentiated skin cells have been largely described in psoriasis; however, their effects on MSCs derived from patients with psoriasis have been only partially described. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of TNF-α inhibitors on cytokine milieu expressed by MSCs isolated from the skin of patients with psoriasis. Resident MSCs from skin of patients with psoriasis and healthy subjects have been isolated, characterized and profiled by PCR and ELISA  for the expression of 22 cytokines involved in Th1 , Th2 and Th17 pathways, both  before and after 12 weeks therapy with TNF-α inhibitors. The administration of TNF-α inhibitors for 12-weeks acts on MSCs as follows: it reduces the expression  of several Th1 -Th17 cytokines whose levels are elevated at baseline (IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-23A, IFN-γ, TNF-α, CCL2, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL5, IL-17A, IL-17C, IL-17F, IL-21, G-CSF). Similarly, it enhances the expression of several Th2 cytokines which are underexpressed at baseline (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5), reducing the expression  of those overexpressed at baseline (TGF-β and IL-13). TNF-α inhibitors could contribute to reduce the pathological imbalance between the Th1 -Th17 vs Th2 axis in MSCs of patients with psoriasis."

However, the pathological roles of IL-17 cascades in generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and  psoriatic erythroderma (PsE) have not been well established. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody against human IL-17-receptor A (IL-17RA), in Japanese patients with GPP and PsE. METHODS: This was an open-label, multicentre, long-term phase III study in Japanese patients with rare and severe types of psoriasis. Patients received brodalumab 140 mg at day 1 and weeks 1 and 2, and then every 2 weeks until week 52. The primary endpoint was the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI). Safety evaluations included treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and changes in laboratory parameters. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients with GPP and 18 with PsE were enrolled. Ten patients with GPP and 16 with PsE completed the study. At week 52 (last observation carried forward), CGI remission or improvement was achieved in 11 patients with GPP and 18 with PsE. The most commonly reported AE was nasopharyngitis (33·3%). Five serious AEs occurred during the study. However, none was considered treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: Brodalumab significantly improved the symptoms of patients with GPP  and PsE throughout the 52 weeks, and demonstrated favourable safety profiles without any new safety signals. Inhibition of IL-17RA-mediated signalling by brodalumab is expected to be a promising new treatment option for patients with GPP and PsE."

Recently, it has been demonstrated that keratinocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential role of keratinocytes, we examined whether TLR9 ligand CpG induces IL-17A expression in keratinocytes. METHODS: We used HaCaT keratinocytes as a model system, and determined CpG-induced IL-17A using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. RESULTS: When HaCaT keratinocytes were treated with CpG, the expression of several cytokines including IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-α and CCL20 was markedly increased. Treatment with nuclear factor (NF)-κB inhibitor significantly blocked the CpG-induced IL-17A production, indicating that CpG induced IL-17A expression through the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, IL-17A secreted from keratinocytes stimulated the CD4+ T cells, resulting in strong induction of IL-22 production. CONCLUSION: Since IL-22 is an important mediator for psoriatic inflammation, our  data suggest that keratinocytes can participate in the pathogenesis of psoriasis  via the TLR9-dependent IL-17A production."

In this study, we provide evidence that  deficiency in Trim32 (a tripartite motif [TRIM] protein with innate antiviral activity) contributes to a T helper type 2 biased response and predisposes to features of AD in mice. On treatment with the toll-like receptor 7 agonist imquimod (IMQ), Trim32 knockout mice displayed compromised psoriasiform phenotypes and defective T helper type 17 response. Instead, IMQ treatment of Trim32 knockout mice induced AD-like phenotypes with enhanced skin infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells, elevation of T helper type 2 cytokines/chemokines  expression, and reduced expression of filaggrin protein expression. Furthermore,  although the induction of phosphorylated Stat3 and RelA was compromised after IMQ treatment in the knockout mice, phosphorylated Stat6 was elevated. CC chemokine ligand 20 induction by tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-17A was reduced in Trim32-deficient keratinocytes, whereas CC chemokine ligand 5 induction by tumor  necrosis factor-α and IL-4 was enhanced. In addition, Trim32 protein levels were  elevated in mice treated with IMQ. Unlike Trim32 overexpression in psoriasis, TRIM32 levels were low in patients with AD. Based on Trim32 induction by IMQ, the lower levels of TRIM32 in AD skin compared with healthy control and psoriatic skin suggest a defective TRIM32 pathway in AD pathogenesis."

Brodalumab, a  fully human Chinese hamster ovary cell-derived immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) anti-IL-17RA monoclonal antibody, is currently the most-developed treatment that  binds to the IL-17RA. The authors review and provide updates of efficacy and safety by several studies on brodalumab. Areas covered: A PubMed search was performed for relevant literature. Among the trials of brodalumab, the most common adverse events included nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and arthralgia. Suicidal ideation and completed suicides had been observed in the brodalumab programme, although evidence to date was quoted as not suggesting a causal association. Expert commentary: By blocking the IL-17 receptor A, brodalumab antagonizes signaling from IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17A/F and IL-25, and this probably contributes to the high efficacy observed in clinical trials. Considering the different therapeutic target and the potential biological implications that blocking IL-17RA instead of IL-17A might have, brodalumab may not necessarily belong to the same class that includes secukinumab and ixekizumab, but it may be classified in a distinct group."

Murine models of AD are essential for preclinical assessments of new treatments. Although many models have been used to simulate AD, their transcriptomic profiles are not fully understood, and a comparison of these models with the human AD transcriptomic fingerprint is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the transcriptomic profiles of 6 common murine models and determine how they relate to human AD skin. METHODS: Transcriptomic profiling was performed by using microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR on biopsy specimens from NC/Nga, flaky tail, Flg-mutated, ovalbumin-challenged, oxazolone-challenged, and IL-23-injected mice. Gene expression data of patients with AD, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis were obtained from previous patient cohorts. Criteria of a fold change of 2 or greater and a false discovery rate of 0.05 or less were used for gene arrays. RESULTS: IL-23-injected, NC/Nga, and oxazolone-challenged mice show the largest homology with our human meta-analysis-derived AD transcriptome (37%, 18%, 17%, respectively). Similar to human AD, robust TH1, TH2, and also TH17 activation are seen in IL-23-injected and NC/Nga mice, with similar but weaker inflammation in ovalbumin-challenged mice. Oxazolone-challenged mice show a TH1-centered reaction, and flaky tail mice demonstrate a strong TH17 polarization. Flg-mutated mice display filaggrin downregulation without significant inflammation. CONCLUSION: No single murine model fully captures all aspects of the AD profile;  instead, each model reflects different immune or barrier disease aspects. Overall, among the 6 murine models, IL-23-injected mice best simulate human AD; still, the translational focus of the investigation should determine which model  is most applicable."

Apparently, T-helper 17 lymphocytes and interleukin (IL)-17 constitute an important element linking those disorders. The role of IL-17 has been confirmed by numerous studies, although it remains not completely understood, and the study results are controversial. Based on the studies performed so far, it is assumed that IL-17 contributes to development of atherosclerosis by means of: stimulation of production of proinflammatory compounds; induction of apoptosis of endothelial cells and heart muscle cells; stimulation of von Willebrand factor production; and induction of the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (atherosclerotic plaque rupture). On the other hand, IL-17 may exert protective activity due to inhibition of proatherogenic interferon-γ and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and production of type I collagen by smooth muscle cells. The role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis  of obesity is as important as other proinflammatory cytokines. On the other hand, its deficiency increases diet-induced obesity and accelerates adipose tissue accumulation. Although the role of IL-17A in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders in humans remains controversial, introduction of anti-IL-17A treatments brings hope that development of metabolic disorders in patients with psoriasis may be inhibited."

Various closely interacting cell types, including innate immune cells, T cells, and keratinocytes, are known to contribute to inflammation. Innate immune cells most likely initiate the inflammatory process by secretion of IL-23. IL-23 mediates expansion of T helper 17 (Th17) cells, whose effector functions, including IL-17A, activate keratinocytes. Keratinocyte activation in turn results in cell proliferation and chemokine expression, the latter of which  fuels the inflammatory process through further immune cell recruitment. One question that remains largely unanswered is how genetic susceptibility contributes to this process and, specifically, which cell type causes disease due to psoriasis-specific genetic alterations. Here we describe a mouse model based on the human psoriasis susceptibility locus TNIP1, also referred to as ABIN1, whose gene product is a negative regulator of various inflammatory signaling pathways, including the Toll-like receptor pathway in innate immune cells. We find that Tnip1-deficient mice recapitulate major features of psoriasis on pathological, genomic, and therapeutic levels. Different genetic approaches, including tissue-specific gene deletion and the use of various inflammatory triggers, reveal that Tnip1 controls not only immune cells, but also keratinocyte biology. Loss of Tnip1 in keratinocytes leads to deregulation of IL-17-induced gene expression and exaggerated chemokine production in vitro and overt psoriasis-like inflammation in vivo. Together, the data establish Tnip1 as a critical regulator of IL-17 biology and reveal a causal role of keratinocytes in  the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

Paradigm-shifting discoveries about AD have been based on adult biomarkers, reflecting decades of disease activity, although 85% of cases begin by 5 years. Blood phenotyping shows only TH2 skewing in patients with early-onset pediatric AD, but alterations in early pediatric skin lesions are unknown, limiting advancement of targeted therapies. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the early pediatric AD skin phenotype and its differences from pediatric control subjects and adults with AD. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR, we assessed biopsy specimens from 19 children with AD younger than 5 years within 6 months of disease onset in comparison with adults with AD or psoriasis and pediatric and adult control subjects. RESULTS: In lesional skin children showed comparable or greater epidermal hyperplasia (thickness and keratin 16) and cellular infiltration (CD3+, CD11c+, and FcεRI+) than adults with AD. Similar to adults, strong activation of the TH2  (IL-13, IL-31, and CCL17) and TH22 (IL-22 and S100As) axes and some TH1 skewing (IFN-γ and CXCL10) were present. Children showed significantly higher induction of TH17-related cytokines and antimicrobials (IL-17A, IL-19, CCL20, LL37, and peptidase inhibitor 3/elafin), TH9/IL-9, IL-33, and innate markers (IL-8) than adults (P < .02). Despite the characteristic downregulation in adult patients with AD, filaggrin expression was similar in children with AD and healthy children. Nonlesional skin in pediatric patients with AD showed higher levels of  inflammation (particularly IL-17A and the related molecules IL-19 and LL37) and epidermal proliferation (keratin 16 and S100As) markers (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The skin phenotype of new-onset pediatric AD is substantially different from that of adult AD. Although excess TH2 activation characterizes both, TH9 and TH17 are highly activated at disease initiation. Increases in IL-19 levels might link TH2 and TH17 activation."

PsA and Ps are likely to be the same disease. PsA develops in nearly 70% of patients with Ps, and the hallmark of the disease is bone erosions and bone formation. Both innate  and adaptive immunity appear to contribute to pathogenesis of PsA and Ps. Trauma  may be a trigger factor for both PsA and Ps. The same T cell clones were reported to be present in both synovial tissues and skin lesions suggesting that a common  antigen drives T cell immune response in the joints and skin lesions of patients  with PsA. The IL-23/IL-17 axis plays a critical pathogenic role for both PsA and  Ps, and biologics neutralizing IL-17A or IL-23/IL-12 are effective therapies for  PsA and Ps. The differential expression of Th17 cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 at various sites could explain the different manifestations of the disease. IL-17 is highly expressed in peripheral joints and skin lesions and causes bone erosions.  IL-22 is highly expressed in skin lesions and entheses, not peripheral joints, and cause bone formation. Finally, mannan from bakers yeast caused PsA-like arthritis and Ps-like skin lesions that were blocked by IL-17 treatment. These data suggest that PsA and Ps are likely to be the same disease exhibiting different manifestations depending on the local cytokine production."

Recent studies have demonstrated that alterations in circulating Tfh cell subsets have significant effects on the progression of numerous autoimmune diseases. To address the role of circulating Tfh cells in psoriasis, we used flow cytometry to analyse frequencies of circulating Tfh cell subsets and levels of IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) expression on B cells in 32 patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 13 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. We observed dynamic changes in Tfh17 cell frequency and disease severity in 10 psoriasis patients during a 6-month treatment. Our results demonstrate that the frequency of Tfh17 cells was significantly increased in psoriasis patients and was positively correlated with psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score, a marker of disease severity (P<0.05). During the follow-up period, the frequencies of Tfh17 cells decreased, and reductions in PASI scores were observed. Moreover,  IL-21R expression on B cells was significantly increased in patients with psoriasis vulgaris (P<0.05). Interestingly, IL-21R levels on B cells were correlated with both PASI score and the frequency of Tfh17 cells (P<0.05). In conclusion, this study is the first investigation of the distribution of circulating Tfh subsets in psoriasis. These results deepen our understanding of the immune state of psoriasis patients. Our data also indicate that Tfh17 cells may not be good biomarkers for diagnosing psoriasis but may be potential biomarkers of disease severity in psoriasis."

Subsequent analyses revealed that the production of Th17 cytokines (IL-17A and IL-23) in the serum and skin of IMQ-induced mice was significantly inhibited by agonistic anti-4-1BB  Abs (10mg/kg), although Th1 cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) were not. Moreover, administration of agonistic anti-4-1BB Abs (10mg/kg) induced a relative increase  of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells in the spleen and draining lymph node (DLN). Taken together, our data provide evidence that agonistic anti-4-1BB Abs possesses immunosuppressive properties in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation, providing insight into the immunomodulatory effect of agonistic anti-4-1BB Abs for psoriasis immunotherapy."

The IL-17 family consists of 6 structurally related cytokines (IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E, IL-17F), of which IL-17A and IL-17F mediate similar biological effects. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate an association between the IL17A (-197G>A; rs2275913) and IL17F (rs763780: T>C; rs11465553: G>A; rs2397084:  T>C) polymorphisms with psoriasis susceptibility as well as response to topical and combined topical with narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) therapy in a Polish  population. METHODS: Association study involving 407 psoriasis patients and 205 healthy controls. Treatment efficacy was analyzed in 207 patients with mild psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; PASI 3-12) and moderate psoriasis (PASI 12-18), who were randomly subjected to topical or combined topical and NB-UVB treatment. The polymorphisms were evaluated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences between psoriasis patients and  controls were found in the frequency of the evaluated IL17A and IL17F genotypes and haplotypes. The IL17A or IL17F polymorphisms were not associated with treatment outcome measures: efficacy of treatment at the eighth week of the study and PASI change after topical or combined topical and NB-UVB therapy. However, IL17F rs2397084 variant allele C carriers required a significantly higher number  of NB-UVB irradiations in comparison to TT homozygotes (15.5 ± 11.4 vs. 11.1 ± 11.9, p = 0.047) to produce a positive clinical response. CONCLUSION: It can be stated that the IL17A and IL17F polymorphisms are not markers of susceptibility to psoriasis. However, the IL17F polymorphism may affect the response to NB-UVB therapy."

Recent report indicates that the prevalence of PsA among Japanese patients with psoriasis is 14.3%, which is similar or slightly less than that of PsA in Caucasian, 6-42%. Skin disorders precede arthritis in 60-80% of Japanese patients with PsA and oligoarthritis or polyarthritis is the dominant pattern of them. The genotypic backgrounds appear different among Japanese and Caucasians. Biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) targeting cytokines IL-12/IL-23, TNF and  IL-17 involved in the pathogenesis of PsA, have been emerging for the treatment.  Although background characteristics are various among studies, anti-IL-17 seemed  to be slightly better in Japanese than in global, whereas anti-IL-12/23 and anti-TNF tended to be better in global than in Japanese. Because PsA is a clinically heterogeneous disorder, we have tried to classify PsA by phenotypic differences of peripheral lymphocyte using 8-color flow cytometry and found that  PsA can be divided to four types, activated Th17-dominant, Th1-dominant, both of  them and neither of them. We currently try to treat patients with different bDMARDs based on the difference of lymphocyte phenotype, which may lead to precision medicine of PsA."

Pathogenesis-based therapy is largely lacking because the underlying molecular basis is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize molecularly cutaneous inflammation and its correlation with clinical and barrier characteristics. METHODS: We analyzed biopsy specimens from 21 genotyped patients with ichthyosis  (congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, n = 6; lamellar ichthyosis, n = 7; epidermolytic ichthyosis, n = 5; and Netherton syndrome, n = 3) using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR and compared them with specimens from healthy control subjects, patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), and patients with psoriasis. Clinical measures included the Ichthyosis Area Severity Index (IASI),  which integrates erythema (IASI-E) and scaling (IASI-S); transepidermal water loss; and pruritus. RESULTS: Ichthyosis samples showed increased epidermal hyperplasia (increased thickness and keratin 16 expression) and T-cell and dendritic cell infiltrates. Increases of general inflammatory (IL-2), innate (IL-1β), and some TH1/interferon (IFN-γ) markers in patients with ichthyosis were comparable with those in patients with psoriasis or AD. TNF-α levels in patients with ichthyosis were increased only in those with Netherton syndrome but were much lower than in patients with psoriasis and those with AD. Expression of TH2 cytokines (IL-13 and IL-31) was similar to that seen in control subjects. The striking induction of IL-17-related genes or markers synergistically induced by IL-17 and TNF-α (IL-17A/C, IL-19, CXCL1, PI3, CCL20, and IL36G; P < .05) in patients with ichthyosis was similar to that seen in patients with psoriasis. IASI and IASI-E scores strongly correlated with IL-17A (r = 0.74, P < .001) and IL-17/TNF-synergistic/additive gene expression. These markers also significantly  correlated with transepidermal water loss, suggesting a link between the barrier  defect and inflammation in patients with ichthyosis. CONCLUSION: Our data associate a shared TH17/IL-23 immune fingerprint with the major orphan forms of ichthyosis and raise the possibility of IL-17-targeting strategies."

However, the in vivo role of CD1a has remained unclear, principally because CD1a is lacking in mice. Through the use of mice with transgenic expression of CD1a, we found that the plant-derived lipid urushiol triggered CD1a-dependent skin inflammation driven by CD4(+) helper T cells that produced the cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 (TH17 cells). Human subjects with poison-ivy dermatitis had a similar cytokine signature following CD1a-mediated recognition of urushiol. Among various urushiol congeners, we identified diunsaturated pentadecylcatechol (C15:2) as the dominant antigen for CD1a-restricted T cells. We determined the crystal structure of the CD1a-urushiol (C15:2) complex, demonstrating the molecular basis of urushiol interaction with the antigen-binding cleft of CD1a. In a mouse model and in patients with psoriasis, CD1a amplified inflammatory responses that were mediated by TH17 cells that reacted to self lipid antigens. Treatment with blocking antibodies to CD1a alleviated skin inflammation. Thus, we propose CD1a as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory skin diseases."

Madecassoside (MAD) was the most important constituents isolated from Centella asiatica, which has long been used in dermatology, and it is supposed that MAD may have effects on psoriasis. In the present study, the BALB/c mice ear and back skin received IMQ for 6 consecutive days to induce psoriasis-like dermatitis. MAD ointment was applied 6h later after IMQ treatment, and the IL-23/IL-17 pathway was investigated. The HE staining, BrdU and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) were used to score the severity of keratinocyte proliferation and inflammation of the skin. Real-time PCR and Western Blot were used to detect the IL-23/IL-17 related cytokines. Flow Cytometry were applied to observe the numbers of Th17 cells. Daily application of IMQ for 6days on mouse ear skin and back skin induced psoriasis-like dermatitis.  Real-time PCR showed that mRNA level of IL-23, IL-22, IL-17A were significantly decreased by MAD ointment treatment in ear skin. HE staining and BrdU incorporation implied that MAD ointment reduced keratinocyte proliferation. Flow  Cytometry results showed MAD ointment decreased the numbers of Th17 cells.

Psoriasis is thought to be initiated by abnormal interactions between cutaneous keratinocytes and systemic immune cells. However, the role of IL-35 in psoriasis remains unclear. In this study, we assessed IL-35 in three well-known psoriasis models: a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), a keratin 14 (K14)-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)-transgenic (Tg) mouse model,  and an imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse model. First, we found that IL-35 suppressed the expression of IL-6, CXCL8, and S100A7, which are highly upregulated by a mixture of five proinflammatory cytokines in HaCaT. Second, a plasmid coding for the human IL-35 sequence coated with cationic liposomes showed potent immunosuppressive effects on K14-VEGF-A-Tg and imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse models. In the K14-VEGF-A-Tg model, our results showed that several types of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced, whereas IL-10 was remarkably induced by IL-35. Compared with pcDNA3.1, there was a small number of  CD4(+)IL-17(+) T cells and a large number of CD4(+)IL-10(+) and CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells in the IL-35 group. Most importantly, we found that IL-35 decreased the total number of macrophages and ratio of M1/M2 macrophages, which has not been reported previously. In addition, compared with dexamethasone, IL-35 showed long-term therapeutic efficacy. In summary, our results strongly indicate that IL-35 plays a potent immunosuppressive role in psoriasis. Thus, IL-35 has potential for development as a new therapeutic strategy for patients with chronic psoriasis and other cutaneous inflammatory diseases."

Allergic skin diseases have a high prevalence. Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases and similar for allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. Over a long period, allergic diseases have been regarded as immunoglobulin E-mediated T-helper-2 (Th2)-driven. But new cytokines and T cells have been discovered within the last years. In this systematic review, the focus is laid on interleukin-17 (IL-17) and the interleukin-20 (IL-20) family which appear to be fine-tuning the Th2-driven answer. RECENT FINDINGS: IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine, which is produced by T cells. Primarily, IL-17 is produced by activated CD4+ cells, called Th-17 cells.  IL-17 regulates keratinocyte expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines. IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases as psoriasis, arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. In allergic diseases, the involvement of the TH17/IL17-pathway has only been recently described. Regarding the IL-20 family, IL-22 is the most interesting and the most studied cytokine in terms of allergic inflammatory disorders. IL-22 is produced by T-helper 22 cells, a new subset of CD4+ cells. SUMMARY: IL-17 as well as IL-22 seem to play a role in the pathogenesis of allergic skin diseases."

OBJECTIVE: To identify differences between GPP and AGEP, here we immunohistochemically evaluated interleukin (IL)-36 and the IL-23/Th17 axis. METHODS: This retrospective comparative immunohistochemical study was completed using 11 biopsies of 11 cases of GPP and 11 biopsies of 11 cases of AGEP. Through staining with the anti-IL-36-alpha (IL-36α), anti-IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), anti-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), anti-IL-23, anti-IL-17, and anti-IL-8 antibodies, main expression location and intensity were visualized in the epidermis and dermis. RESULTS: In both diseases, diffuse IL-36α expression was observed in the epidermis. IL-36Ra expression was observed in the dermal perivascular area as well as in the epidermis. NF-κB expression was observed in the epidermis and perivascular dermal area. Diffuse IL-23 and IL-17 expression was seen in the whole epidermis and the perivascular dermal area. IL-8 was expressed in the subcorneal pustules and parakeratotic area. Contrary to other cytokines, IL-23 expression in the epidermis of patients with GPP was more intense than only that  in patients with AGEP. CONCLUSION: Common pathomechanisms might exist in the development of GPP and AGEP based on these immunohistochemical results, but further studies are needed."

RESULTS: Increased frequencies of CD4+ IL-17A+ T cells were seen in peripheral blood of patients with psoriasis vulgaris (P < 0.001). Although serum IL-17A and  IL-23 concentrations were higher in patients with psoriasis than in controls, the results did not reach statistical significance.

There is an increased population of T-helper cells in the  skin lesions as well as in the peripheral circulation in psoriasis. However, the  relative percentage of each T-cell phenotype in the disease pathogenesis is understudied. Our aim was to study the immune-phenotype of the different T-helper/T-reg cell subsets in patients with psoriasis, with respect to healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 189 cases of psoriasis and 189 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Disease severity was determined by psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scoring.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation, and T-cell immunophenotyping was done by flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: In psoriasis, we observed an imbalance in T-cell immunophenotype, characterised by an increase in Th1/Th17 cells and a relative decrease in Th2/T-reg cells, as compared to the healthy controls. We also found that the percentage of Th1/Th17 cells showed a linear trend, increasing with increasing disease severity (PASI). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest an immune-dysregulation in psoriasis associated with a predominance of Th1/Th17 phenotype, especially with increasing severity of the disease."

Evidence suggests that  the morbidity and mortality rates for sarcoidosis in the USA are rising, despite  widespread use of anti-inflammatory therapies. In this review, we survey new therapies that target specific inflammatory pathways in other diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohns disease, and psoriasis) that are similar to pathways relevant to sarcoidosis immunopathogenesis, and therefore, represent potentially new sarcoidosis therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis has been well elucidated over  the past few years. There is abundant evidence for T-cell activation in sarcoidosis leading to activation of both Th1 and Th17 inflammatory cascades. Therapies targeting T-cell activation, Th1 pathways (such as the interleukin-6 inhibitors), Th17 pathway mediators, and others have been Food and Drug Administration approved or under investigation to treat a variety of autoimmune inflammatory diseases, but have not been studied in sarcoidosis. Targeting the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and the ubiquitine proteasome system with new agents may also represent a novel therapeutic option for patients with sarcoidosis. SUMMARY: Rising morbidity and mortality rates for patients with sarcoidosis strongly support the need to develop more effective anti-inflammatory therapies to treat chronic disease."

The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (AZM) had been demonstrated to inhibit the TLR4 agonist-induced maturation and activation of murine bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of AZM on the induction of DC maturation and activation by imiquimod (IMQ), a synthetic TLR7 agonist, as well as its potential as a therapeutic agent for psoriasis. METHODS: The effects of AZM on IMQ-induced DC activation were investigated based  on the expression of cell surface markers and cytokine secretion. The lysosomal pH, post-translational processing of TLR7, and TLR7 signaling were also examined  in DCs. The therapeutic effects of AZM on psoriasis were evaluated in a murine model of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation. RESULTS: AZM significantly inhibited the expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD40 and CD80) and reduced TNF-α, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-23p19 in BMDCs and IFN-α production in plasmacytoid DCs. AZM treatment impaired lysosomal acidification, interrupted TLR7 maturation in the lysosome, and ultimately blocked the IMQ-induced NF-κB and IRF-7 nuclear translocation in DCs. AZM treatment decreased signs of IMQ-induced skin inflammation in BALB/c mice. In addition to decreasing keratinocyte hyper-proliferation and restoring their terminal differentiation, AZM treatment decreased the accumulation of DCs as well as CD4, CD8 T cells and IL-17 producing cells in psoriatic skin lesions. AZM treatment improved splenomegaly, decreased the populations of Th17 and γδ T cells, and reduced the expression of cytokines known to be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, such as IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22 and IL-23, in the skin and spleen. CONCLUSION: AZM impaired IMQ-induced DC activation by decreasing lysosomal acidification and disrupting TLR7 maturation and signaling. AZM significantly improved the IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation in mice. AZM may be a potential therapeutic candidate for psoriasis treatment."

To explore the role of microbiota, we induced skin inflammation in germ-free (GF), broad-spectrum antibiotic (ATB)-treated or conventional (CV) BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. We found that both mice reared in GF conditions for several generations and CV mice treated with ATB were more resistant to imiquimod-induced skin inflammation than CV mice. The ATB treatment dramatically  changed the diversity of gut bacteria, which remained stable after subsequent imiquimod application; ATB treatment resulted in a substantial increase in the order Lactobacillales and a significant decrease in Coriobacteriales and Clostridiales. Moreover, as compared to CV mice, imiquimod induced a lower degree of local and systemic Th17 activation in both GF and ATB-treated mice.

The T helper (Th)17 cell response is considered to play a major role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Th17 cells are implicated in the mechanism of pathogenesis of imiquimod (IMQ)‑induced skin inflammation. Using a mouse model, we demonstrated that GTW protected mice from developing psoriasis-like lesions induced by topical IMQ administration. This protection was associated with significantly decreased mRNA levels of Th17 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 in mouse skin samples as well as fewer IL-17-secreting splenic CD4+ lymphocytes in IMQ-exposed mice. There were no significant effects on the proportion of CD4+ interferon (IFN)-γ+ T cells, CD4+IL-4+ T cells and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells in  the spleen cells. Taken together with the unchanged mRNA levels of Th1 cytokine IFN-γ, Th2 cytokine IL-4 and Treg cytokine IL-10 in IMQ-exposed mouse skin following GTW administration, our findings suggest that the immunosuppressive effect of GTW in psoriasis is exerted mainly on Th17 cells, rather than on Th1, Th2 or Treg cells. Furthermore, we showed that GTW suppressed Th17 function through the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. These results have the potential to pave the way for the use of GTW as an agent for the treatment of psoriasis."

Th17 cells mediate pathological immune responses responsible for autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. Previous studies focused on RORγt target genes and their function in Th17 differentiation. In this study, we assessed posttranscriptional regulation of RORγt and identified a functional ubiquitination site, K446. Mutation of K446  to arginine to prevent ubiquitination greatly enhanced recruitment of steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1), a coactivator critical for RORγt activity. Correspondingly, the K446 to arginine mutation potentiated Th17 differentiation.  We also showed that ubiquitin-specific protease (USP)15 interacted with RORγt, removed ubiquitin from K446, and stimulated RORγt activity by enhancing coactivator SRC1 recruitment. Knockdown of USP15 or expression of inactive USP15  impaired Th17 differentiation, suggesting a positive role for USP15-mediated deubiquitination of RORγt in Th17 differentiation. Therefore, ubiquitination of K446 limits RORγt-mediated Th17 differentiation by inhibiting the recruitment of  coactivator SRC1. Our study will inform the development of treatments that target RORγt ubiquitination pathways to limit Th17-mediated autoimmunity."

The epidemiologic coexistence of these diseases is corroborated by findings at the level of disease, biogeography, and intrafamilial and intrapatient coincidence. The identification of shared susceptibility loci and DNA polymorphisms has confirmed this correlation at a genetic level. The pathogenesis of both diseases implicates the innate and adaptive segments of the immune system. Increased permeability of the epidermal barrier in skin and intestine underlies the augmented interaction of allergens and pathogens with inflammatory receptors of immune cells. The immune response between psoriasis and IBD is similar and comprises phagocytic, dendritic, and natural killer cell, along with a milieu of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides  that stimulate T-cells. The interplay between dendritic cells and Th17 cells appears to be the core dysregulated immune pathway in all these conditions. The distinct similarities in the pathogenesis are also reflected in the wide overlapping of their therapeutic approaches. Small-molecule pharmacologic immunomodulators have been applied, and more recently, biologic treatments that target proinflammatory interleukins have been introduced or are currently being evaluated.

Furthermore and similar to  the oncology field, progress in the understanding of single autoimmune condition  is becoming most specific with psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis being ideal paradigms with treatment options diverging after decades of common therapies, as  illustrated by IL17-targeting approaches. The ultimate result of these advances is towards personalized medicine with an ideal approach being tailored on a single patient, based on a finely tuned definition of the immunogenetics, epigenetics, microbiome, and biomarkers. Finally, experimental reports suggest that cancer-associated immune mechanisms or the role of T and B cell subpopulations should be better understood in autoimmune diseases. While we hailed the 2014 literature in the autoimmunity world as part of an annus mirabilis, we should not be mistaken in the strong stimulus of research in autoimmunity represented by the 2015 articles that will be summarized in this article."

Epub 2016 Jul 7.","IL-33 circulating serum levels are increased in patients with non-segmental generalized vitiligo.","IL-33 is a recently identified cytokine, encoded by the IL-33 gene, which is a member of the IL-1 family that drives the production of T-helper-2 (Th-2)-associated cytokines. Serum levels of IL-33 have been reported to be up-regulated in various T-helper (Th)-1/Th-17-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel. To investigate whether cytokine imbalance plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, we performed a case-control association study by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of IL-33 in our patients. IL-33 serum levels were measured by a quantitative enzyme immunoassay technique in patients with non-segmental generalized vitiligo and compared with those of healthy controls. IL-33 serum levels in patients with vitiligo were significantly increased than those in healthy controls. There was a positive correlation of IL-33 serum levels with extension of vitiligo and disease activity. This study suggests a possible systemic role of IL-33 in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Inhibiting IL-33 activity might be a novel therapeutic  strategy in the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory disease, like vitiligo."

To date, the physiopathology of psoriasis  is not still completely elucidated but many researches are ongoing which have led for example to the discovery of the Th17/Th22 pathway. The conventional therapeutic approaches (local or systemic route) appeal to various classes of drugs with complex mechanisms of action and non-negligible side effects. Although there is no therapy capable to cure psoriasis, the current goal is to relieve symptoms as longer as possible with a good benefit/risk ratio. That is one of the principal limits of conventional antipsoriatic drugs. New formulations based on nanoencapsulation are a promising opportunity to answer to this limit by offering an optimization of the conventional antipsoriatic drug use (higher activity, lower side effects and frequency of application, etc.). Herein, we tried to put in perspective the mechanistic insights (histological and immunological views) proposed into scientific literature these last years in order to have a better comprehension of psoriasis physiopathology resulting in skin lesions and PsA. The therapeutic armamentarium and the different strategies in the management of psoriasis are discussed in greater details. To finish, the field of encapsulation in nanoparticles is broached in order to put forward recent advances in innovative skin drug delivery systems (ISDDSs) of antipsoriatic active agents for a better efficacy, safety and compliance."

Therapeutic mechanisms include the proapoptotic and immunomodulating effects of UV, affecting many cells and involving a variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, downregulating the Th17/IL-23 response with simultaneous induction of regulatory immune cells. However, exposure to UV radiation in a subset of psoriasis patients leads to exacerbation of the disease. We herein shed light on the predisposing factors of photosensitive psoriasis, including genetics (such as HLA-Cw*0602 or CARD14), gender and coexisting photodermatoses such as polymorphic light eruption (PLE) in the context of potential molecular mechanisms behind therapeutic photoresponsiveness or photoaggravation. UV-induced damage/pathogen-associated molecular patterns, damage to self-coding RNA (signalling through Toll-like receptors), certain antimicrobial peptides and/or inflammasome activation may induce innate immunity, leading to psoriasis at the site of UV exposure when there is concomitant, predisposing resistance against UV-induced suppression of the adaptive immune response (like in PLE) that otherwise would act to reduce psoriasis."

CD69 associated with the aromatic-amino-acid-transporter complex LAT1-CD98 and regulated its surface expression and uptake of L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and the intracellular quantity of L-Trp-derived activators of AhR. In vivo administration of L-Trp, an inhibitor of AhR or IL-22 abrogated the differences between CD69-deficient mice and wild-type  mice in skin inflammation. We also observed LAT1-mediated regulation of AhR activation and IL-22 secretion in circulating Vγ9(+) γδ T cells of psoriatic patients. Thus, CD69 serves as a key mediator of the pathogenesis of psoriasis by controlling LAT1-CD98-mediated metabolic cues."

Moreover, KdPT upregulated Foxp3 in CD4+ T cells from mice and from peripheral blood of individuals with psoriasis and decreased the expression of type 1 inflammatory cytokines, indicating that the beneficial effect of KdPT was, at least in part, mediated by the induction of functional regulatory T cells that suppressed the activation of pathogenic CD4+ IFN-γ+ and CD4+ IL-17+ T cells. Thus, these data might suggest KdPT as a potential novel therapeutic alternative for the treatment of psoriasis."

Lung cancer accounts for 28% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide, and roughly 80% of patients with newly-diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with metastatic disease, with a poor prognosis of around 12 months. Therefore, there is a high unmet medical need for the development of new and potent systemic treatments in this deadly disease. The emergence of immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 or anti-PDL1 as candidate therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) indicates that targeting critical immuno-modulatory cytokines including those within the IL-17-Th1/Th17 axis may have proven benefit in the treatment of lung cancer. Areas covered: In this review we describe the current evidence for aberrant IL-17-Th1/Th17 settings in cancer, particularly with regard to targeting this axis in NSCLC. We further discuss the current agents under pharmaceutical development which could potentially target this axis, and discuss the current limitations and areas of concern regarding the use of these in lung cancer. Expert opinion: Current evidence suggests that moving forward agents targeting the IL-17-Th1/Th17 pathway may have novel new oncoimmunology indications in the treatment paradigm for NSCLC."

Preliminary report.","BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin disease characterised by proliferation of keratinocytes, primarily due to cytokines Th1 and Th17. This profile is involved in pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, a frequently found comorbidity in patients with psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: In this study we determine the correlation of levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-23, IL-12, and IL-22 in patients with psoriasis with and without metabolic syndrome and clinically healthy controls. METHODS: We included 55 patients with plaque psoriasis: 30 with metabolic syndrome (PPMS), 25 without metabolic syndrome (PP), 15 healthy subjects (HS) and 15 with metabolic syndrome (MS). Quantification of serum levels of IL-12, TNF-α,  IL-22, and IL-23 was done by ELISA. RESULTS: We observed that serum levels of IL-12 were more elevated in PP group, while the lowest levels of TNF-α were seen in HS group. IL-22 was found to be higher in PP than in PPMS (p<0.05). PP patients with PASI scores rating as severe showed higher levels of IL-12. TNF-α level analysis showed significant differences in HS group compared with the others; levels of this cytokine were lower in patients with PP and moderate PASI scores than in MS group (p<0.05). We  found no correlation between cytokine levels and psoriasis or between cytokines and PASI scores. In PP group, a positive correlation was observed between IL-23 and fasting glucose (r=0.432, p<0.05), as well as a negative correlation between  IL-23, IL-22, and IL-12 versus waist circumference (r=-0.504, r=-0.556 and r=-0.511, respectively; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Psoriasis is not just a skin disorder, but rather a condition with systemic implications, with intervention of pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to metabolic syndrome and other comorbidities, which in turn increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease."

Vitamin D3 analogues are widely used in the treatment of psoriasis, however, their actions on pDCs are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Vitamin D3 analogue calcipotriol (CAL) on pDCs, focusing on the cytokine production and chemotactic activity. METHODS: We compared in mice the effects of CAL, cyclosporine A (CyA), and triamcinolone acetonide (TA) on the cytokine production by pDCs (IFN-α), conventional DCs (TNF-α), and γd T cells (IL-17A). pDCs isolated from mouse spleen cells were stimulated with CpG-ODN in the presence or absence of each drug for 48h. Purified splenic conventional DCs (cDCs) and lymph node γδ T cells were  stimulated with CpG-ODN or with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody, respectively. IFN-α, TNF-α and IL-17A in the 48-h culture supernatants were quantified by ELISA. We also studied the ability of CAL to inhibit the chemotaxis of freshly isolated pDCs toward chemerin and VEGF-A, representative chemoattractants of pDCs, by a real-time monitoring method, EZ-Taxiscan. To assess the effect of CAL on pDC accumulation in vivo, we painted CAL ointment to the mouse skin inflamed by topical application of imiquimod cream (IMQ) for 4 consecutive days. In the skin  samples, we enumerated 440c+ pDCs by immunohistochemistry and evaluated the mRNA  expression of cytokines by real-time PCR. RESULTS: CAL significantly inhibited CpG-enhanced pDC IFN-α production at a comparable level to T cell IL-17A production, whereas its effect on cDC TNF-α production was minimal. Accordingly, CAL suppressed the CpG-augmented expression  of TLR9 and MyD88. On the contrary, CyA strongly suppressed the production of TNF-α and IL-17A, but not IFN-α. TA inhibited the production of all the cytokines tested. The effect of CAL on the chemotactic activity of pDCs was also evaluated, demonstrating a significant downmodulation by exposure to the reagent. CAL depressed chemerin receptor CMKLR1 expression in pDCs. The in vivo mouse study showed that simultaneous application of CAL to the imiquimod-applied skin reduce  both the recruitment of pDCs and the expression of IFN-α2 in the skin. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CAL uniquely downmodulates the cytokine production and chemotactic activity of pDCs. The CAL suppression of the in vivo pDC accumulation to the skin suggests that these actions are therapeutically relevant."

The aim of this work was to study the interactions of skin-derived fibroblasts with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with a focus on the Th17 pathway and to identify a mechanism which leads to a high interleukin (IL)-17 secretion. A co-culture system between PBMC and skin fibroblasts was developed. Healthy and patient PBMC were added to non-lesional or lesional skin fibroblasts at a 5:1 ratio for 48 h in the presence or not of activation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Monocytes were removed or not by adherence before the  co-culture. An anti-podoplanin antibody was also used during the co-culture. Cytokine production (IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-17) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and cell staining (CD3, CD4, IL-17 and podoplanin) by flow cytometry. Without T cell receptor (TCR) activation, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1β production increased in PBMC-fibroblast co-culture compared to PBMC alone. No additional effect was observed with TCR activation, with no difference in the Th17 cell percentage in activated-PBMC alone or co-cultured. Conversely, IL-17 production was increased highly only in co-cultures between control and patient activated-PBMC and skin fibroblasts. Removal of monocytes decreased cytokine production, notably that of IL-17. Addition of an anti-podoplanin antibody decreased IL-17 secretion by 60%. Interactions between resting PBMC and fibroblasts induce the IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1β production. PBMC activation and cell  interactions are critical for a high IL-17 secretion. Podoplanin contributes largely to this massive IL-17 secretion."

It is involved in the pathogenesis  of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its models; we recently demonstrated that exogenous IL-33 could inhibit collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in C57BL/6 mice. However, its pathophysiological role in RA is unclear. Indeed, mice deficient in  the IL-33 receptor ST2 show reduced susceptibility to arthritis, and the disease  is not modified in IL-33-deficient mice. We examined the immune response in wild-type (WT) and IL-33-deficient mice with CIA. To further understand the role  of endogenous IL-33 in inflammatory diseases, we studied its role in a skin psoriasis model. Mice on a C57BL/6 background were deficient in IL-33 but expressed lacZ under the IL-33 promoter. Therefore, IL-33 promotor activity could be analyzed by lacZ detection and IL-33 gene expression was analyzed by X-Gal staining in various mice compartments. Frequencies of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th1 and Th17 cells were evaluated by flow cytometry in WT and IL-33(-/-) mice. Bone resorption was studied by evaluating osteoclast activity on a synthetic mineral matrix. Psoriasis-like dermatitis was induced by application  of imiquimod to the skin of mice. RESULTS: Severity of CIA was similar in IL-33(-/-) and WT littermates. Joints of  IL-33(-/-) mice with CIA showed IL-33 promotor activity. In mice with CIA, frequencies of Tregs, Th1 and Th17 in the spleen or lymph nodes did not differ between the genotypes; osteoclast activity was higher but not significantly in IL-33(-/-) than WT mice. Psoriasis development did not differ between the genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its expression in the synovium of arthritic mice and normal  keratinocytes, IL-33 is not required for CIA development in arthritis or psoriasis. Its absence does not induce a T cell shift toward Th1, Th17 or Treg subpopulations. Altogether, these data and our previous ones, showing that exogenous IL-33 can almost completely inhibit CIA development, suggest that this  cytokine is not crucial for development of chronic inflammation. Studies of RA patients are needed to determine whether treatment targeting the IL-33/ST2 axis would be effective."

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of this topical applicant, focusing on skin-infiltrating TH17 cells. METHODS: In 10 patients with plaque psoriasis, calcipotriol (Cal), betamethasone  dipropionate (Bet), or the calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate 2-compound formulation (CB) was applied to 3 different psoriatic plaques with similar severity once a day for 14 days. One nonapplied lesion was used as a control. Four-millimeter biopsy specimens were taken from each site, cut into 2 pieces, and subjected to histologic examination and ex vivo expansion of skin-infiltrating T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and IL-2. RESULTS: Clinical, histologic, and IL-17A(+) cell-infiltrate improvement was found in the following order: CB > Cal > Bet > control or CB > Bet > Cal > control. Numbers of ex vivo expanded T cells were decreased by topical application of Bet and CB, and CB exhibited the most suppressive result.  Numbers and frequencies of TH17 cells were significantly reduced by CB and Cal, suggesting that Cal has a capacity to preferentially suppress TH17 cells. When the stocked T cells from control samples were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies in the presence of Bet, Cal, or both, Cal downmodulated IL-17 and IFN-γ production and tended to upregulate IL-4 and IL-6 without apoptosis, but Bet inhibited production of these cytokines with apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Cal and Bet have different effects on T cells to normalize psoriatic changes, with decreased TH17 cell expansion in the skin lesions."

Ustekinumab is an IL-12/IL-23p40 antagonist that suppresses Th1, Th17 and Th22 activation, commonly used for psoriasis patients. We sought to assess efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In this phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 33 patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned to either ustekinumab (n=16) or placebo (n=17), with subsequent crossover at 16 weeks, and last dose at 32 weeks. Background therapy with mild topical steroids was allowed to promote retention. Study endpoints included clinical (SCORAD50) and biopsy-based measures of tissue structure and inflammation, using protein and gene expression studies. The ustekinumab group achieved higher SCORAD50 responses at 12, 16 (the primary endpoint) and 20 weeks  compared to placebo, but the difference between groups was not significant. The AD molecular profile/transcriptome showed early robust gene modulation, with sustained further improvements until 32 weeks in the initial ustekinumab group. Distinct and more robust modulation of Th1, Th17 and Th22 but also Th2-related AD genes was seen after 4 weeks of ustekinumab treatment (i.e. MMP12, IL-22, IL-13,  IFN-γ, elafin/PI3, CXCL1 and CCL17; P<.05). Epidermal responses (K16, terminal differentiation) showed faster (4 weeks) and long-term regulation (32 weeks) from baseline in the ustekinumab group. No severe adverse events were observed. Ustekinumab had clear clinical and molecular effects, but clinical outcomes might have been obscured by a profound placebo effect, most likely due to background  topical glucocorticosteroids and possibly insufficient dosing for AD."

In contrast to biologic agents, these compounds block intracellular targets such as transcriptional factors or enzymes. AREAS COVERED: Tofacitinib is a small molecule that acts as a reversible, competitive inhibitor of ATP in the ATP binding site of JAK proteins, determining their inactivation, thus prevents the downstream activation of the STAT proteins, which are then unable to up-regulate the pro-inflammatory genes implicated in psoriasis. The authors present an overview of Phases I - III clinical trials of tofacitinib for psoriasis based on peer-reviewed literature. EXPERT OPINION: In clinical practice, it is important to assess the response of psoriasis to tofacitinib and identify possible clinical, genetic, and immune biomarkers to predict the response. Comorbidities associated with psoriasis, in particular metabolic syndrome and obesity, are also an important aspect of using  tofacitinib in clinical practice. There are some evidences that a drug such as tofacitinib could be used to improve not only psoriasis, but also some of its important comorbidities."

Until the end of the last millennium, systemic therapy had been restricted to four oral agents: methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, and fumaric acid esters. Today, there are additionally seven biologics and one new oral antipsoriatic drug, as well as the first available biosimilars. Six more biologics with novel target structures and at least four biosimilars are currently being developed (phase III). This progress has been based on new insights into the pathogenesis of psoriasis, in which tumor necrosis factor and especially Th17 immune responses with their associated cytokines interleukin 23 and 17 play a key role. The development of new-generation biologics as well as immunomodulatory small molecules can be attributed to these pathophysiological findings. Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, dimethyl fumarate, and Janus kinase inhibitors all interact with Th17 immune responses. Some of these drugs are in advanced clinical development and are also beneficial in psoriatic arthritis. Today, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis therefore rank among the most readily treatable inflammatory autoimmune disorders.

Group IID-secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IID) is abundantly expressed in dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues and resolves the Th1 immune response by controlling the steady-state levels of anti-inflammatory lipids such as docosahexaenoic acid and its metabolites. Here, we show that psoriasis and contact dermatitis were exacerbated in Pla2g2d-null mice, whereas they were ameliorated in Pla2g2d-overexpressing transgenic mice, relative to littermate wild-type mice. These phenotypes were associated with concomitant alterations in  the tissue levels of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites, which had  the capacity to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory and Th1/Th17-type cytokines in dendritic cells or lymph node cells. In the context of cancer, however, Pla2g2d deficiency resulted in marked attenuation of skin carcinogenesis, likely because of the augmented anti-tumor immunity. Altogether,  these results underscore a general role of sPLA2-IID as an immunosuppressive sPLA2 that allows the microenvironmental lipid balance toward an anti-inflammatory state, exerting beneficial or detrimental impact depending upon distinct pathophysiological contexts in inflammation and cancer."

The involvement of T helper 17 (Th17) cells in these disorders provides a novel opportunity to investigate the relationship between them. The present study aimed to determine whether the same or overlapping inflammatory pathways are involved in the two diseases, and the influence of different types of ACD on psoriasis. Compound mouse models of Th1 or Th2‑type contact hypersensitivity (CHS) combined with imiquimod (IMQ)‑induced psoriasis‑like inflammation were established, in order to mimic the characteristics of ACD and psoriasis. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry and cytokine detection in blood serum and tissues were used  to compare the differences between the mice treated with IMQ alone or IMQ combined with Th1 and Th2‑type CHS. As compared with the IMQ‑treated mice or IMQ-treated Th1‑type CHS mice, the mice with Th2‑type CHS treated with IMQ exhibited more serious psoriasis‑like inflammation with increased epidermal thickness and infiltrating cells in the derma. High mRNA expression levels of interleukin (IL)‑17, IL‑22, IL‑23, TNF‑α and RORγt were detected in back skin lesions. Additionally, high levels of IL‑17 and IL‑22 in blood serum were detected in IMQ‑treated mice combined with Th2‑type CHS. The mice treated with IMQ alone, and IMQ treatment combined with Th1‑type CHS had a comparable psoriasis‑like inflammatory response in the back skin. In conclusion, these data  demonstrate that Th2‑type CHS exacerbated the IMQ‑treated psoriatic inflammation  of mice via the IL‑23/IL‑17 axis. Th17 cells and associated pathways may link ACD and psoriasis. Therefore, patients with psoriasis should avoid contact with specific sensitizers, such as fragrance and rubber products, which may induce Th2 polarization."

Here, we identified both body fat gain in obesity and impaired glucose metabolism as two independent risk factors for increased serum levels of free fatty acids (FFAs). Since obesity is associated with increased and/or delayed resolution of inflammation observed in various chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, we investigated the impact of FFAs on human monocyte-derived and mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (DCs) functions relevant for the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation. FFAs such as palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA) did not affect the pro-inflammatory immune response of DCs. In contrast, PA and OA sensitize DCs resulting in augmented secretion of TH1/TH17-instructive cytokines  upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. Interestingly, obesity in mice worsened a TH1/TH17-driven psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Strong correlation of the amount of total FFA, PA, and OA in serum with the severity of skin inflammation points to a critical role of FFA in obesity-mediated exacerbation of skin inflammation. Our data suggest that increased levels of FFAs might be a predisposing factor promoting a TH1/TH17-mediated inflammation such as psoriasis  in response to an inflammatory danger signal."

This study describes the changes in serum levels of IL-17, 22 and 23 in  patients of psoriasis vulgaris treated with narrow band ultraviolet B (NBUVB). METHODS: The serum levels of IL-17, 22 and 23 were compared with a control group  (n = 30) before and after NBUVB. In addition, post-NBUVB levels were compared with healthy controls. Psoriasis Area Severity Score (PASI) and Body Surface Area scoring were used to evaluate severity of disease. RESULTS: When compared with the non-psoriasis control group, IL-17, 22 and 23 were higher in psoriasis patients (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). The serum levels of all three interleukins strongly correlated with severity of disease. Although IL-17, 22 and 23 decreased after NBUVB, decline in IL-17 was not significant after phototherapy as compared to controls (p = 0.634). IL-22 and 23 continued to remain elevated post-phototherapy when compared with control group (p < 0.05, p < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The serum levels of IL-17, 22 and 23 decrease after phototherapy in  psoriasis. Post-phototherapy only the IL-17 levels decrease to that of non-psoriasis controls. Our study supports the role of T helper 17 cell specific  cytokines in psoriasis and a possible mechanism of action of NBUVB via inhibition of these cytokines."

IL-17A is expressed by a subset of T-cells, called Th17 cells, at inflammatory sites. Most cell types can respond to the local production of IL-17A because of the near ubiquitous expression of IL-17A receptors, IL-17RA and IL-17RC. IL-17A stimulates the release of cytokines and chemokines designed to recruit and activate both neutrophils and memory T-cells to the site of injury or inflammation and maintain a proinflammatory state. IL-17A-producing pathogenic T-cells contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. This study describes the generation and characterization of ixekizumab, a humanized IgG4 variant IL-17A-neutralizing antibody. Ixekizumab binds human and cynomolgus monkey IL-17A with high affinity and binds rabbit IL-17A weakly but does not bind to rodent IL-17A or other IL-17 family members. Ixekizumab effectively inhibits the interaction between IL-17A and its receptor in binding assays and potently blocks IL-17A-induced GRO or KC secretion in cell-based assays. In an in vivo mouse pharmcodynamic model, ixekizumab blocks human IL-17A-induced mouse KC secretion. These data provide a comprehensive preclinical characterization of ixekizumab, for which the efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in human clinical trials in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis."

The etiology of GPP is only partially understood, and GPP lacks approved treatments. Loss-of-function mutations in the  interleukin 36 (IL-36) receptor antagonist (IL36RN), an inhibitor of innate immune activation in the skin, and therapeutic efficacy of IL-1 blockade in a subset of patients with GPP are viewed as evidence for an autoinflammatory pathogenesis. A pathogenic role of T cells has not been considered. OBJECTIVE: To test whether ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody blocking IL-12 and  IL-23, is an effective treatment modality for patients in whom GPP treatment with conventional psoriasis drugs or antagonists of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has not been sufficiently effective, is contraindicated, or has lost efficacy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We treated a series of 4 patients with GPP with ustekinumab, which was applied on an outpatient basis according to the dosing regimen approved for psoriasis vulgaris. In 3 patients it was combined with low doses of the retinoid acitretin. IL36RN mutations were determined in all 4 patients by means of targeted sequencing of genomic DNA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The response to therapy was assessed by clinical examination. RESULTS: The 4 patients were female. Sequencing of IL36RN identified a homozygous mutation in case 1 (Pro76Leu). The other 3 patients carried no rare IL36RN variants. Overall GPP duration ranged from 50 to 146 months. Ustekinumab treatment is currently ongoing in all 4 patients without loss of efficacy, currently reaching treatment durations of 17 (case 1) to 44 months (case 3). Ustekinumab treatment induced sustained remissions in all 4 GPP patients. This response was independent of IL36RN mutations and consolidated by combination with low doses of the retinoid acitretin. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Ustekinumab-induced remissions suggest that T cells play a crucial role in GPP pathogenesis based on the documented role that IL-12 and IL-23 play in autoimmune diseases through differentiating helper T cell 1 (TH1) and maintaining TH17 responses. Acitretin treatment may support ustekinumab efficacy, possibly by suppressing TH17 responses through the retinoid-related orphan receptors, RORγt and RORα. Combining IL-12/IL-23 blockade and acitretin may constitute an efficient treatment modality interfering with GPP pathomechanisms."

Increased inflammation including  T-helper 17 cell-mediated effects has been implicated in AAA pathogenesis. Psoriasis is considered to be a T-helper 17-driven chronic inflammatory disease and in view of potentially overlapping inflammatory mechanisms, we investigated the risk of AAA in patients with psoriasis in a nationwide cohort. APPROACH AND RESULTS: The study comprised all Danish residents aged ≥18 years followed up from January 1, 1997, until diagnosis of AAA, December 31, 2011, migration or death. Information on comorbidity, concomitant medication, and socioeconomic status was identified by individual-level linkage of administrative registers. Incidence rates for AAA were calculated and incidence rate ratios adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, medications, socioeconomic status, and smoking were estimated in Poisson regression models. A total of 5 495  203 subjects were eligible for analysis. During the study period, we identified 59 423 patients with mild psoriasis and 11 566 patients with severe psoriasis. The overall incidence rates of AAA were 3.72, 7.30, and 9.87 per 10 000 person-years for the reference population (23 696 cases), mild psoriasis (240 cases), and severe psoriasis (50 cases), respectively. The corresponding adjusted incidence rate ratios for AAA were increased in patients with psoriasis with incidence rate ratios of 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.39) and 1.67 (confidence interval, 1.21-2.32) for subjects with mild and severe disease, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide cohort, psoriasis was associated with a disease severity-dependent increased risk of AAA. The mechanisms and consequences of this novel finding require further investigation."

OBJECTIVE: We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical efficacy of tofacitinib in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: Twelve patients with plaque psoriasis were randomized (3:1) to receive 10 mg of tofacitinib or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Biopsy specimens were taken from nonlesional (baseline) and lesional (baseline, days 1 and 3, and weeks 1, 2, 4, and 12) skin. Biopsy specimens were examined for psoriatic epidermal features (thickness, Ki67(+) keratinocytes and keratin 16 [KRT16] mRNA expression, and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription [pSTAT](+) nuclei) and T-cell and dendritic cell (DC) subsets by using immunohistochemistry, and mRNA transcripts were quantified by using a microarray. RESULTS: In lesional skin keratinocyte pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 staining was increased at baseline but reduced after 1 day of tofacitinib (baseline, median of 1290 pSTAT1(+) cells/μm(2); day 1, median of 332 pSTAT1(+) cells/μm(2); and nonlesional, median of 155 pSTAT1(+) cells/μm(2)). Epidermal thickness and KRT16  mRNA expression were significantly and progressively reduced after days 1 and 3 of tofacitinib administration, respectively (eg, KRT16 decreased 2.74-fold, day 3 vs baseline, P = .016). Decreases in DC and T-cell numbers were observed after weeks 1 and 2, respectively. At week 4, significant decreases in IL-23/TH17 pathways were observed that persisted through week 12. Improvements in clinical and histologic features were strongly associated with changes in expression of psoriasis-related genes and reduction in IL-17 gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib has a multitiered response in patients with psoriasis: (1) rapid attenuation of keratinocyte Janus kinase/STAT signaling; (2) removal of keratinocyte-induced cytokine signaling, leading to reductions in pathologic DC and T-cell numbers to nonlesional levels; and (3) inhibition of the IL-23/TH17 pathway."

Although this particular phenotype of psoriasis is usually associated with streptococcal throat infections and mainly occurs in HLA-Cw6(+) patients, the specific immunologic response to this innate stimulus that causes these skin lesions is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate how key cellular elements of patients with GP respond to Streptococcus pyogenes and whether this initial immune response is favored by the genetic and environmental background of these patients. METHODS: Circulating memory T cells and autologous epidermal cells from samples from either patients with GP (n = 14) or healthy control subjects (n = 6) were cocultured ex vivo in the presence of an S pyogenes extract. Levels of the psoriasis-associated cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were  determined. The expression of several genes with increased (DEFB4, S100A7, LCN2,  IL36G, IL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) or decreased (FLG and LOR) transcripts in  psoriatic lesions was examined in keratinocytes treated with coculture supernatants. RESULTS: When skin-homing effector memory cutaneous lymphocyte antigen-positive T cells were used in cocultures, a TH17-dominant response was observed, as reflected by the higher amounts of IL-17A and IL-17F than IFN-γ. Moreover, a higher TH17 response was observed in cells isolated from patients with flares associated with a streptococcal tonsillitis and with the HLA-Cw6 allele (cohort 1). In addition, in normal keratinocytes the supernatants from these cocultures induced an increase in IL-17-associated genes, such as DEFB4, S100A7, LCN2, IL36G, and IL8 but a decrease in FLG and LOR, thereby confirming the role of activated TH17 cells. CONCLUSION: This study reveals a dominant TH17 response of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen-positive T cells activated by epidermal cells and S pyogenes in patients  with GP."

The critical role of the IL-23/TH17 axis in immune-mediated diseases has emerged from different studies.

The pathogenesis of psoriasis is complex and the exact mechanism remains elusive. However, psoriasis  is thought to result from a combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental influences. Recent studies have identified that epigenetic factors including dysregulated DNA methylation levels, abnormal histone modification and microRNAs  expressions are involved in the development of psoriasis. The interplay of immune cells and cytokines is another critical factor in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  These factors or pathways include Th1/Th2 homeostasis, the Th17/Treg balance and  the IL-23/Th17 axis. Th17 is believed particularly important in psoriasis due to  its pro-inflammatory effects and its involvement in an integrated inflammatory loop with dendritic cells and keratinocytes, contributing to an overproduction of antimicrobial peptides, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines that leads to amplification of the immune response. In addition, other pathways and signaling molecules have been found to be involved, including Th9, Th22, regulatory T cells, γδ T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and their related cytokines. Understanding the pathogenesis of psoriasis will allow us to develop increasingly efficient targeted treatment by blocking relevant inflammatory signaling pathways and molecules. There is no cure for psoriasis at the present time, and much of the treatment involves managing the symptoms. The biologics, while lacking the adverse effects associated with some of the traditional medications such as corticosteroids and methotrexate, have their own set of side effects, which may include reactivation of latent infections. Significant challenges remain in developing safe and efficacious novel targeted therapies that depend on a better  understanding of the immunological dysfunction in psoriasis."

These discoveries catalyzed a search for new  treatment targets resulting in many new therapies that are now available for patients with psoriatic disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Helper T cells that secrete interleukin-17 (TH17) along with CD8+ cells, innate lymphocyte cells, and gamma delta T cells are important in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA. Recently, agents that target interleukin-17, the interleukin-17 receptor, and interleukin-23 (antip19) have been approved or are in clinical trials. Apremilast, a new oral agent, was approved for the treatment of psoriasis and PsA. SUMMARY: Secukinumab, an interleukin-17A antibody, has been approved for treatment of psoriasis and PsA in the United States. It is effective with a good  safety profile. Ixekizumab, another anti-interleukin-17A antibody, is currently in clinical trials and brodalumab, an interleukin-17 receptor antagonist, was removed from clinical trials because of safety concerns despite demonstrated efficacy in psoriasis and PsA. Targeting interleukin-23 with antibodies to p19 is another approach with encouraging results in psoriasis. Apremilast, an oral agent, approved to treat psoriasis and PsA demonstrates moderate efficacy with an excellent safety record. The role of tofacitinib in psoriatic disease remains to  be determined pending a safety review in psoriasis and completion of PsA trials."

It is characterized, in its typical  form, by erythematous and squamous plaques with well-defined borders, associated  with increased proliferation of the keratinocytes, inflammation and greater number of dilated blood vessels in the upper dermis. A role of Th1 CD4 T cells was initially suspected. More recently, Th17 CD4 T cells have been shown to play  a major role in the disease. It has led to the development of Th17 inhibitors, such as anti-IL-23 (cytokine that induces Th17 CD4 T cell differentiation), anti-IL-17, anti-IL-17RA (IL-17 receptor) and anti-IL-22 (cytokines that are notably produced by Th17 CD4 T cells)."

As transcription factor, AhR controls the IL-22 production by several  cell types (i.e. Th17 cells). Here, we analyzed the role of Ahr in IL-22 production by immune cells in the inflamed skin, using an imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse model. Our results indicate that IL-22 is expressed in the ear of imiquimod-treated Ahr(-/-) mice but less than in wild-type mice. We then studied  the role of AhR on three cell populations known to produce IL-22 in the skin: γδ  T cells, Th17 cells, and ILC3, and a novel IL-22-producing cell type identified in this setting: CD4(-) CD8(-) TCRβ(+) T cells. We showed that AhR is required for IL-22 production by Th17, but not by the three other cell types, in the imiquimod-treated ears. Moreover, AhR has a role in the recruitment of γδ T cells, ILC3, and CD4(-) CD8(-) TCRβ(+) T cells into the inflamed skin or in their local proliferation. Taken together, AhR has a direct role in IL-22 production by Th17 cells in the mouse ear skin, but not by γδ T cells, CD4(-) CD8(-) TCRβ(+) T  cells and ILCs."

Epub 2016 Mar 18.","An Overview of the Pathogenesis of Immune-mediated Skin Injury.","The skin has a relatively limited range of responses to injury regardless of the  specific mechanism underlying the insult. When the skins barrier function is disrupted, it mounts an inflammatory and proliferative response in an effort to restore this essential function. The epidermal keratinocyte is central to the initiation of the skins response, triggering an immunologic cascade that leads to the stereotypic morphologic responses that we encounter as pathologists. Drug-induced immune-mediated cutaneous injuries or drug eruptions are relatively common, sometimes with overlapping mechanisms, and it is often possible to classify these based on the classical hypersensitivity-type reactions. A specific type of immune-mediated skin injury is psoriasis. The pathogenesis of psoriasis is multifactorial but involves the interaction of environmental factors with a genetic predisposition. The initial stimulus triggering the development of psoriatic lesions involves activation of epidermal  keratinocytes, with subsequent amplification driven by cross talk between the adaptive and innate immune systems. Several cytokines produced by Th17 T helper cells have recently been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of psoriasis,  namely, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-17, due to demonstrated clinical efficacy of cytokine blockade; and IL-22, based on its effects in both in vitro and in vivo models."

In previous studies, erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (ERDR1) was shown to have a negative correlation with proinflammatory cytokine IL-18. However, the role of  ERDR1 in the inflammatory skin disease psoriasis has not been evaluated. In this  study, to investigate the role of ERDR1 in psoriasis, recombinant ERDR1 was injected intraperitoneally into a psoriasis mouse model. Recombinant ERDR1 (rERDR1) significantly alleviated the symptoms of psoriasis-like skin inflammation and reduced the mRNA of various psoriasis-related markers, including keratin 14, S100A8, and Th17-related cytokines IL-17 and IL-22, suggesting that rERDR1 exerts therapeutic effects on psoriasis via the regulation of Th17 functions. Additionally, the expression of CCL20, a well-known Th17 attracting chemokine, was determined. CCL20 expression significantly decreased in the rERDR1-injected group compared with the vehicle (PBS)-injected group. CCR6 expression in the psoriatic lesional skin was also decreased by rERDR1 administration, implying the inhibition of CCR6-expressing Th17 cell chemotaxis via the downregulation of CCL20. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence that ERDR1 may be a potential therapeutic target for psoriasis."

The histamine H4 receptor (H4R) agonist 4-methylhistamine (4-MH) plays an important role in immunomodulation of inflammatory responses associated with allergic inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated the effects of H4R agonist  4-MH on the development of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice and explored the immunoregulatory mechanism involved. The total clinical severity scores were significantly ameliorated by treatment with 4-MH (20 mg/kg) and 4-MH (40 mg/kg). Histological analysis of the skin revealed that 4-MH (20 mg/kg) and 4-MH (40 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the psoriatic phenotypes, including epidermal hyperplasis, hyperkeratosis and lymphocytes infiltration. Treatment with 4-MH (20 mg/kg) and 4-MH (40 mg/kg) led to reductions in the levels of Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-α, and IL-27) in the serum  and dorsal skin, whereas Th17 cytokines levels (IL-17A and IL-23) did not change  in response to treatment with 4-MH (20 mg/kg) and 4-MH (40 mg/kg). Furthermore, the number of CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells was significantly increased by treatment with 4-MH (40 mg/kg). Taken together, these results imply  that H4R agonist 4-MH might be an effective immunomodulatory approach for treatment of patients with psoriasis and the effects may be related to inhibited  epidermal alteration, selectively reduced Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines, and recruited CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) Treg cells."

METHODS: Quantitative gene expression analysis of Th1, Th17, and Th9 cytokines was performed in intestinal biopsy samples obtained from patients with PsA, HLA-B27-positive patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), patients with Crohns disease (CD), and healthy controls. Expression and tissue distribution of interleukin-23 (IL-23), IL-17, IL-22, IL-9, and IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Flow cytometry was used to study the frequency of Th9 cells among peripheral blood, lamina propria,  and synovial fluid mononuclear cells. The functional relevance of IL-9R expression on epithelial cells was assessed in functional in vitro studies. Th9 cells in synovial tissue from patients with PsA were also studied. RESULTS: Subclinical gut inflammation in PsA patients was characterized by a clear Th17 and Th22, but not Th1, polarized immune response. Unlike AS and CD, a  strong and significant up-regulation of IL-9 was observed in PsA gut, especially  among infiltrating mononuclear cells, high endothelial venules, and Paneth cells. IL-9-positive mononuclear cells were demonstrated to be in large part Th9 cells.  IL-9 overexpression was accompanied by significant Paneth cell hyperplasia. Paneth cells strongly overexpressed IL-9R, and stimulation of epithelial cells, isolated from PsA patients, with IL-9 resulted in overexpression of α-defensin 5  and IL-23p19. Peripheral and synovial expansion of α4β7+ Th9 cells was also observed in patients with PsA. Increased expression of IL-9 and IL-9R was also found in synovial tissue. CONCLUSION: Strong IL-9/Th9 polarization seems to be the predominant immunologic  signature in patients in PsA."

However, the function of HO-1 in cutaneous inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, remains unknown. The abnormal activation of Stat3, a known transcription factor that induces inflammation and regulates cell differentiation, is directly involved in the pathogenesis and development of psoriasis. Hence, targeting Stat3 is potentially beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis. In this study, HO-1 activation significantly alleviated the disease-related pathogenesis abnormality. To determine the mechanism by which HO-1 exerts immune protection on Th17-related cytokines, IL6/IL22-induced Stat3 activation was significantly suppressed, accompanied by decreased cell proliferation and reversed abnormal cell proliferation. Importantly, HO-1-induced Stat3 suppression was mediated through the activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Overall, our study provides direct evidence indicating that HO-1 might be a useful therapeutic target for psoriasis. SHP-1-mediated suppression of Stat3 activation after HO-1 activation is a unique molecular mechanism for the regulation of Stat3 activation."

In addition to the classical biphasic model of differentiation of T-helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells, unexpected increases in the numbers of CD4(+)T-cell subsets, including Th17, Th9, T follicular-helper (Tfh) and T-regulatory (Treg) cells, have been recognized. In the present review, we focus on how these various T-helper cell subsets contribute to the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. In particular, we focus on multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and asthma as typical model diseases in which multiple T-helper cell subsets have recently been suggested to  play a role. We will also discuss various unique sub-populations of T-helper cells that have been identified. First, we will introduce the heterogeneous T-helper cell subsets, which are classified by their simultaneous expression of multiple key transcription factors. We will also introduce different kinds of memory-type Th2 cells, which are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic type-2 immune-related diseases. Finally, we will discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of the plasticity and heterogeneity of T-helper cell subsets. The latest progress in the study of T-helper cell subsets has forced us  to reconsider the etiology of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases beyond the model based on the Th1/Th2 balance. To this end, we propose another model--the pathogenic T-helper population disease-induction model--as a possible mechanism for the induction and/or persistence of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases."

Acarbose was found to decrease inflammatory parameters in diabetic patients in addition to its anti-diabetic effects. Here, we report that imiquimod (IMQ)-induced epidermal hyperplasia and psoriasis like-inflammation were significantly inhibited by acarbose treatment. Real-time PCR showed that mRNA levels of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β IL-17A, and IL-22 in skin were also decreased significantly by acarbose. In addition, we found that acarbose reduced infiltration of CD3(+) T cells and GR-1(+) neutrophils in lesional skin and also reduced the percentage of IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells (Th17) and IL-17- and IL-22-producing γδ T cells in the spleen. In contrast, acarbose increased the frequency of IL-10-producing CD4(+) regulator Tr1 T cells in the spleen and small intestine. These results indicate that oral administration of acarbose can attenuate the severity of imiquimod-induced psoriasis with local and systemic anti-inflammatory and immune  modulation effects, thus suggesting that acarbose is an effective therapeutic strategy for psoriasis regulation."

IL-17-targeting biologics have been successful in reducing the disease burden of psoriasis patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Unfortunately, the stratum corneum prevents penetration of large molecule weight  proteins, including monoclonal antibodies. Thus, for the majority of psoriasis patients ineligible for systemic treatments, a small molecule targeting RORγt, the master regulator of IL-17 family cytokines, may represent an alternative topical medicine with biologic-like efficacy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The preclinical studies described in this manuscript bridge the gap from bench to bedside to provide the scientific foundation for a compound entering clinical trials for patients with mild to moderate psoriasis. In addition to several ex vivo reporter assays, primary T cell cultures, and the imiquimod mouse model, we demonstrate efficacy in a newly developed human ex vivo skin assay, where Th17-skewed cytokine expression is induced from skin-resident immune cells. Importantly, the skin barrier remains intact allowing for the demonstration of topical drug delivery. With the development of this novel assay, we demonstrate potent compound activity in the target tissue: human skin. Finally, target engagement by this small molecule was confirmed in ex vivo lesional psoriatic skin. CONCLUSIONS: Our work describes a progressive series of assays to demonstrate the potential clinical value of a novel RORγ inverse agonist small molecule with high potency and selectivity, which will enter clinical trials in late 2015 for psoriasis patients."

However, it remains unknown whether the immune response of scalp psoriasis differs from understood pathomechanisms of psoriasis  in other skin areas. We sought to determine the cellular and molecular phenotype  of scalp psoriasis by performing a comparative analysis of scalp and skin using lesional and nonlesional samples from 20 Caucasian subjects with untreated moderate to severe psoriasis and significant scalp involvement and 10 control subjects without psoriasis. Our results suggest that even in the scalp, psoriasis is a disease of the inter-follicular skin. The immune mechanisms that mediate scalp psoriasis were found to be similar to those involved in skin psoriasis. However, the magnitude of dysregulation, number of differentially expressed genes, and enrichment of the psoriatic genomic fingerprint were more prominent in skin lesions. Furthermore, the scalp transcriptome showed increased modulation of several gene-sets, particularly those induced by interferon-gamma, compared with  that of skin psoriasis, which was mainly associated with activation of TNFα/L-17/IL-22-induced keratinocyte response genes. We also detected differences in expression of gene-sets involving negative regulation, epigenetic regulation,  epidermal differentiation, and dendritic cell or Th1/Th17/Th22-related T-cell processes."

The aim of this study was to determine the factors that induce KIR-3DL2 expression, and to characterize the relationship between HLA-B27 and the phenotype and function of KIR-3DL2-expressing CD4+ T cells in SpA. METHODS: In total, 34 B27+ patients with SpA, 28 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (20 B27- and 8 B27+), and 9 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were studied. KIR-3DL2 expression and other phenotypic characteristics of peripheral blood and synovial fluid CD4+ T cells were studied by flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting. T cell receptor clonality was determined by template-switch anchored reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. Cytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Cellular activation induced KIR-3DL2 expression on both naive and effector CD4+ T cells. KIR-3DL2 binding to B27+ cells promoted expression of KIR-3DL2, the Th17-specific transcription factor retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor γt, and the antiapoptotic factor B cell lymphoma 2. KIR-3DL2+CD4+ T cells in patients with ankylosing spondylitis were oligoclonal and enriched for markers of T cell activation and for the gut homing receptor CCR9. In the presence of B27+ antigen-presenting cells, KIR-3DL2+CD4+ T cells produced less interleukin-2 (IL-2) but more IL-17. This effect was blocked by HC10, an antibody that inhibits the binding of KIR-3DL2 to B27 heavy chains. CONCLUSION: KIR-3DL2 binding to HLA-B27 licenses Th17 cell differentiation in SpA. These findings raise the therapeutic potential of targeting HLA-B27-KIR-3DL2 interactions for the treatment of B27+ patients with SpA."

The incidence of PV is 2-3% in the general population and there is still no possibility to cure. Trigger factors have been identified to initiate and maintain inflammation in the skin, which is characterized by Th1-, Th17- and  Th22- cells. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) plays a role in the pathogenesis of PV. HMGB1 is a DNA-binding protein located in the nucleus, which acquires cytokine-like properties once released from the cell upon necrotic cell death or  actively secreted by immune cells in inflammation and cancer. METHODS: We recruited 90 psoriatic patients under and without therapy with mild,  intermediate and severe progression of disease, defined by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index. Serum levels of HMGB1 in patients with PV were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Our results show an increased level of HMGB1 in the sera of patients with PV in comparison to healthy donors. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that HMGB1 levels are significantly increased with disease progression and are downregulated after standard therapies for PV have been conducted. CONCLUSION: Our data provide insights into a possible role of HMGB1 for inflammation in PV."

Although significant mechanistic overlap can exist between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), to date there have been no reports investigating the IL-36 family in gastrointestinal inflammation. Here we  demonstrate that expression levels of IL-36α are specifically elevated in the colonic mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients. This elevated expression is mirrored in the inflamed colonic mucosa of mice, wherein IL-36 receptor deficiency confirmed this pathway as a mediator of mucosal inflammation. Il36r-/- mice exhibited reduced disease severity in an acute DSS-induced model of colitis  in association with decreased innate inflammatory cell infiltration to the colon  lamina propria. Consistent with these data, infection with the enteropathogenic bacteria Citrobacter rodentium, resulted in reduced innate inflammatory cell recruitment and increased bacterial colonization in the colons of il36r-/- mice.  Il36r-/- mice also exhibited altered T helper cell responses in this model, with  enhanced Th17 and reduced Th1 responses, demonstrating that IL-36R signaling also regulates intestinal mucosal T-cell responses. These data identify a novel role for IL-36 signaling in colonic inflammation and indicate that the IL-36R pathway  may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention in IBD."

The inflammation is driven by a complex interplay between immune and skin cells involving interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-23 and TNF-α as key drivers. The calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate two-compound fixed combination product is widely used for topical treatment of psoriasis. However, the mechanism behind its high efficacy has not been elucidated in detail. OBJECTIVE: Here, we investigated and compared the immune modulatory effects of betamethasone, calcipotriol and the combination in ex vivo cultures of psoriatic  skin and in vitro cultures of primary human cells that recapitulate key cellular  activities of psoriatic inflammation. METHOD: The immune modulatory effect of the treatments on psoriatic skin and on in vitro differentiated Th1/Th17 cells, Tc1/Tc17 cells, monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells and primary keratinocytes was assessed by a panel of inflammatory and phenotypic related transcription factors and cytokines. The expression was evaluated by both gene and protein analysis. RESULTS: Compared to vehicle control or mono-treatments, the effect of calcipotriol/betamethasone combination was significantly better in inhibiting the secretion of IL-17A and TNF-α in psoriatic skin. Additionally, the two components showed additive inhibitory effects on secretion of IL-23 and TNF-α by DCs, of IL-17A and TNF-α by both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and reduced inflammatory responses in Th17-stimulated keratinocytes. Furthermore, calcipotriol was found to enhance IL-10 secretion in psoriatic skin and in human T cells, to induce secretion of type 2 cytokines by T cells and, lastly, to significantly modulate the differentiation of DCs and T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrate a unique and supplementary immune modulatory effect of calcipotriol/betamethasone combination on TNF-α and IL-23/Th17 immune axis, supporting the superior clinical efficacy of the combination product compared to the respective mono-treatments in psoriasis patients."

Increased expression of Th17 cells and cytokines secreted by them provides evidence for its central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-17A,  signature cytokine of Th17 cells was found to be highly differentially expressed  in psoriatic lesional skin. However, cellular and molecular mechanism by which IL-17A exerts its function on keratinocyte is incompletely understood. To understand IL-17A mediated signal transduction pathways, gene expression profiling was done and differentially expressed genes were analysed by IPA software. Here, we demonstrate that during IL-17A signaling total cholesterol levels were elevated, which in turn resulted in the suppression of genes of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. We found that accumulation of cholesterol was essential for IL-17A signaling as reduced total cholesterol levels by methyl β cyclodextrin (MBCD), significantly decreased IL-17A induced secretion of CCL20, IL-8 and S100A7 from the keratinocytes. To our knowledge this study for the first time unveils that high level of intracellular cholesterol plays a crucial role in IL-17A signaling in keratinocytes and may explain the strong association between psoriasis and dyslipidemia."

The soluble and cellular mediators of these closely related diseases are being elucidated through genetic approaches such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as animal and molecular models. Novel therapeutics targeting these mediators (IL-12, IL-23, IL-17, IL-17 receptor, TNF) are effective in treating both the skin and joint manifestations of psoriasis, reaffirming the shared pathophysiology of PsV and PsA. However, the molecular and cellular interactions between skin and joint disease have not been well characterized. Clearly, PsV and PsA are highly variable in terms of their clinical manifestations, and this heterogeneity can partially be explained by differences  in HLA-associations (HLA-Cw*0602 versus HLA-B*27, for example). In addition, there are numerous other genetic susceptibility loci (LCE3, CARD14, NOS2, NFKBIA, PSMA6, ERAP1, TRAF3IP2, IL12RB2, IL23R, IL12B, TNIP1, TNFAIP3, TYK2) and geoepidemiologic factors that contribute to the wide variability seen in psoriasis. Herein, we review the complex interplay between the genetic, cellular, ethnic, and geographic mediators of psoriasis, focusing on the shared mechanisms  of PsV and PsA."

This  study aimed to assess the capacity of PF to inhibit imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis. Mice treated with IMQ were divided into four groups and administered 240mg/kg/day or 120mg/kg/day of PF, 1mg/kg/day of methotrexate (MTX), or normal saline intragastrically. Weight-matched mice treated with vaseline were used as controls. Morphology, structural features, keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory cell infiltration, levels of Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg cytokine mRNA, and phosphorylation of Th17 differentiation-related proteins were  assessed. Mouse spleen cells were incubated under Th17 polarizing conditions, then with PF (2, 20, and 200μg/ml) and cell viability, Th17 differentiation, and  Th17 cytokines and the orphan nuclear receptor (RORγt) mRNA levels were assessed. PF alleviated IMQ-induced keratinocyte proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced mRNA levels of Th17 cytokines at day 4 and phosphorylation of Th17 differentiation-related proteins. However, 2, 20, or 200μg/ml PF did not affect spleen cell viability, and 2 and 20μg/ml PF reduced IL-17 secretion under Th17 polarizing conditions. Finally, 2 and 20μg/ml PF inhibited mRNA expression of Th17 cytokines and phosphorylation of Stat3 in spleen cells under Th17 polarizing conditions. These results suggest that PF inhibits IMQ-induced psoriasis by regulating Th17 cell response and cytokine secretion via phosphorylation of Stat3."

Conversely, IL-17 signaling is critical for immunity to opportunistic mucosal infections caused by the commensal fungus Candida albicans, as mice and humans lacking the IL-17R experience chronic mucosal candidiasis. IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF bind the IL-17RA-IL-17RC heterodimeric complex and deliver qualitatively similar signals through the adaptor Act1. Here, we used a mouse model of acute oropharyngeal candidiasis to assess the impact of blocking IL-17 family cytokines compared with specific IL-17 cytokine gene knockout mice. Anti-IL-17A antibodies, which neutralize IL-17A and IL-17AF, caused elevated oral fungal loads, whereas anti-IL-17AF and anti-IL-17F antibodies did not. Notably, there was a cooperative effect of blocking IL-17A, IL-17AF, and IL-17F together. Termination of anti-IL-17A treatment was associated with rapid C. albicans clearance. IL-17F-deficient mice were fully resistant to oropharyngeal candidiasis, consistent with antibody blockade. However, IL-17A-deficient mice had lower fungal burdens than anti-IL-17A-treated mice. Act1-deficient mice were much more  susceptible to oropharyngeal candidiasis than anti-IL-17A antibody-treated mice,  yet anti-IL-17A and anti-IL-17RA treatment caused equivalent susceptibilities. Based on microarray analyses of the oral mucosa during infection, only a limited  number of genes were associated with oropharyngeal candidiasis susceptibility. In sum, we conclude that IL-17A is the main cytokine mediator of immunity in murine  oropharyngeal candidiasis, but a cooperative relationship among IL-17A, IL-17AF,  and IL-17F exists in vivo. Susceptibility displays the following hierarchy: IL-17RA- or Act1-deficiency > anti-IL-17A + anti-IL-17F antibodies > anti-IL-17A  or anti-IL-17RA antibodies > IL-17A deficiency."

The expression and role of IL-36 cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohns disease (CD) is currently debated. Here, we observed that during imiquimod-induced mouse skin inflammation and in human psoriasis, expression of IL-36α, γ and IL-36Ra, but not IL-36β and IL-38 mRNA, was induced and correlated  with IL-1β and T helper type 17 (Th17) cytokines (IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23, CCL20).

In the colon of mice with dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis and  in patients with CD, only IL-36α, γ and IL-38 were induced at relatively low levels and correlated with IL-1β and IL-17A. We suggest that only a minor subgroup of patients with RA (17-29%) or CD (25%) had an elevated IL-36 agonists/antagonists ratio, versus 93% of patients with psoriasis. By immunohistochemistry, IL-36 cytokines were produced by various cell types in skin, synovium and colonic mucosa such as keratinocytes, CD68⁺ macrophages, dendritic/Langerhans cells and CD79α⁺ plasma cells. In primary cultures of monocytes or inflammatory macrophages (M1), IL-36β and IL-36Ra were produced constitutively, but IL-36α, γ and IL-38 were produced after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. These distinct expression profiles may help to explain why only subgroups of RA and CD patients have a potentially elevated IL-36 agonists/antagonists ratio."

Th17-cells are pivotal players in those diseases. Recently, we demonstrated that  Th17-cells produce interleukin (IL)-29 and that IL-29 is highly present in psoriatic lesions. Whether IL-29, with its action on epithelial cells and melanocytes, contributes to psoriasis pathogenesis, was unknown so far. Analysis  of IL-29-treated human keratinocytes revealed induction of the chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11, and, to a much lesser extent, CXCL9. Unlike these CXCR3A ligands, known to attract Th1-, CD8(+), NK-, and Th1/Th17 transient cells, no influence was found on chemokines attracting other immune cell populations or on molecules modulating the CXCR3A/CXCR3A ligand interaction. CXCR3A ligand expression was also induced by IL-29 in melanocytes and in epidermis models and explanted skin.  Regarding other psoriasis-relevant cytokines, interferon-γ and, less potently, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β shared and strengthened IL-29s capacity. Murine IL-29 counterpart injected into mouse skin provoked local CXCL10 and CXCL11 expression, T-cell infiltration, and, in consequence, skin swelling. The elevated IL-29 expression in psoriatic lesions was associated with upregulation of CXCR3A ligands compared to non-lesional skin of these patients and to the skin of healthy donors and atopic dermatitis patients, which lack IL-29 production. Importantly, neutralization of IL-29 reduced CXCR3A ligand levels in explant cultures of psoriatic lesions. Finally, elevated blood CXCL11 levels were found in psoriasis that might be useful for monitoring lesional activity of the IL-29 axis. In summary, the Th17-cytokine IL-29 induces specific chemokines and, in consequence, provokes skin infiltration of potentially pathogenic T-cells.KEY MESSAGES: IL-29 selectively induces CXCR3A-binding chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) in skin cells.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with the anti-tumor-necrosis-factor antagonist, adalimumab, induces significant modulation of the Th1, Th17 and Th22  pathways, and correlates cellular activity with clinical response. METHODS: This study included 21 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who were treated with adalimumab, and 10 healthy control subjects. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at week 12. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the frequency of circulating Th1, Th17 and Th22 cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the expression of T-bet (Th1-related), retinoid-acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt, Th17-related) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR, Th22-related). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze the serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). RESULTS: At baseline, the frequencies of Th1, Th17 and Th22 cells were higher in  psoriasis patients compared to the healthy controls. The expression of transcription factors T-bet, RORγt and AHR, and the serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, IL-6 and TNF-α were higher in psoriasis patients compared to the healthy controls. After adalimumab therapy, there was a significant decline in the frequencies of Th1, Th17 and Th22 cells, and a concomitant decrease in the levels of their associated transcription factors and cytokines.

Until recently, biologic treatment for psoriasis was limited to tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and an interleukin (IL)-12/23 p40 subunit inhibitor. Newly developed biologics targeting the pro-inflammatory IL-17A cytokine have shown success in providing higher levels of clinical efficacy in patients with psoriasis. Secukinumab, a member of this novel class of IL-17 inhibitors, is the latest biologic to receive US FDA approval for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. AREAS COVERED: This comprehensive review will cover the pharmacology, efficacy, safety and future role of secukinumab and other IL-17 blockers in the treatment of plaque psoriasis. EXPERT OPINION: While biologics have revolutionized patient care for chronic plaque psoriasis, they are associated with loss of response over time. When treatment failure occurs with existing biologics, physicians are left with few alternative treatment options to offer patients. The introduction of secukinumab  has provided an additional therapeutic agent that offers improved skin clearance, better health related quality of life and a favorable side-effect profile."

Until recently, few treatment options were available for PsA and patients suffered immense physical and social burden. Traditional disease modifying agents show limited efficacy in the treatment of PsA. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs are effective for all the manifestations, yet recent  studies show that up to 50% of patients either do not tolerate these medications  or do not maintain a clinical response. The evolution in the treatment of PsA emerged from improved understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease with Th1 and Th17 cells taking center stage.

RECENT FINDINGS: High-resolution imaging revealed that new bone formation, observed in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is centered at enthesial sites in contrast  to hand osteoarthritis, and new bone formation is also present in psoriasis patients without arthritis. Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that the IL-23/IL-17 pathway is directly involved in altered bone phenotypes in PsA. Apart from Th17 and Th22 cells, CD8IL-17 T cells, γδT cells, and type 3 innate lymphoid cells also secrete IL-17 and IL-22. Further studies will be needed to clarify the role of these cells in bone remodeling in the context of psoriatic disease. Recent research also strengthened the earlier viewpoint that mechanical stress can serve as a trigger for joint inflammation and arthritis development. Recent findings suggest that inflammation beginning in the skin may become more generalized and involve musculoskeletal structures. Other reports suggest that gut microbiota might have a role in joint inflammatory responses and bone remodeling in psoriatic disease. Successful application of omics approaches and advance imaging studies also revealed many novel aspects of psoriatic diseases and joint-related pathologies which will likely help pinpoint causal genes, pathways, and novel biomarkers in the near future. SUMMARY: Imaging studies have provided new insights into new bone formation phenotypes in PsA. The IL-23/IL-17 pathway is of central importance in psoriatic  bone remodeling where, apart from CD4 T helper cells, other IL-17 and IL-22-secreting innate and adaptive cells may also be involved. Insights from study of the microbiome and from omics technologies will set the stage for new advances in our understanding of bone disorders in psoriatic diseases."

Our approach was to measure the IL-6 level in SF using a multiplex bead immunoassay. Reverse-phase protein array was used to assess Janus  kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2, extra-cellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and 2, protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), signal transducer and activator and transcription (STAT) 1, STAT3, and STAT5 phosphoproteins in total T cell lysates from SF of patients with PsA. Frequencies of CD4+IL-17A-F+IL-23+ CD4+ Th cells producing IL-17A and IL-17F (Th17) and CD4+CD25high intracellular forkhead box transcription factor+ (FOXP3+) phenotypes, and the percentage of Treg- and Teff- cells were quantified in SF and matched peripheral blood (PB) of patients with PsA and PB of healthy controls (HC) by flow cytometry. Our results were the following: In PsA SF samples, a coordinate increase of JAK1, ERK1/2, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 phosphoproteins was  found in total T cells in SF of PsA; where IL-6 levels were higher than in PB from HC. Expanded CD4+IL-17A-F+IL-23+ Th17, CD4+ CD25- Teff- and CD4+CD25(high) FoxP3+Treg subsets, showing similar levels of enhanced IL-6Rδ expression, were confined to PsA joints. In our studies, the transcriptional network profile identified by ex vivo signaling protein mapping in T lymphocytes in PsA joints revealed the complex interplay between IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23 signaling and differentiation of Th17 cells and CD4+Tregs in sustained joint inflammation in PsA."

Th17 cells are a subset of Th cells, characterized by the production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin  (IL)-17A (IL-17A) and IL-17F, which bind to a receptor complex comprised of IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits. Th17 cells combat extracellular and fungal infections, but have been implicated in autoimmune diseases. In many autoimmune conditions, the dysregulated immune response involves several parts of the immune system, including autoantibodies, B and T cells. Targeted biological therapies are appealing, as they may prevent unwanted side effects in patients. There is evolving evidence that Th17 cells are important in the kidney, mediating injury in response to vascular or chemical insults to the renal tubules, and in autoimmune diseases of the glomerulus, either through a specific attack on the glomerular basement membrane or as part of a generalized systemic inflammatory disease. Therapies targeting IL-17A, IL-12p40 and IL-17RA are being explored in clinical trials or are being utilized in clinical practice for the treatment of other IL-17 mediated diseases, such as psoriasis. This review explores the current evidence that IL-17A and Th17 cells may be pathogenic in immune kidney disease, including anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis and lupus nephritis, as well as in acute kidney injury. It will discuss the place that biological agents against IL-17A, IL-12p40 and IL-17RA may have in the treatment of these conditions."

Report of two cases and review of literature.","BACKGROUND: Inteleukin (IL)12 and IL23 are two main cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated disease. IL12 is produced by macrophages and B lymphocytes and mediates differentiation of Th1 lymphocytes, while IL23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine essential for the differentiation of Th17 cells. Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 protein subunit shared by IL12 and IL23, therefore it blocks the signal transmission of both cytokines. MAIN OBSERVATIONS: We present two cases and discuss the long-term efficacy of ustekinumab as a treatment of psoriasis in patients affected by autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögrens syndrome, who presented with severe  psoriasis after anti-TNF treatment. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, these are the first cases reported in  the literature describing the long-term good efficacy of ustekinumab not only on  paradoxical forms of psoriasis induced by anti-TNF-α drugs, but also on the articular involvement in a patient affected by RA and in a patient affected by Sjögren syndrome."

Given that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, we investigated whether A. cinnamomea could inhibit the development of Th17 cells, the main producer of IL-17, and exhibit therapeutic effects on an animal model of psoriasis. We found that A. cinnamomea extract (AC) inhibited the differentiation of Th17 cells as well as the production of IL-17A,  IL-21, and IL-22 from these cells. This effect was associated with the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation and RORγt expression. Notably, the oral administration of AC reduced psoriasis-like inflammation in imiquimod-mediated dermal damage, repressed the expression of IL-17A, IL-22, and TNF-α in skin lesions, and decreased the infiltration of CD4⁺ T cells, CD8⁺ T cells, and neutrophils into the dermis. Finally, serum levels of IL-17A were decreased in AC-treated mice with psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Taken together, these findings indicate that AC inhibits Th17 cell differentiation, suggesting a role for A. cinnamomea in the treatment of psoriasis and other Th17 cell-mediated inflammatory diseases."

Emerging evidences suggest the interleukin (IL)-12B and IL-23R genes encoding the common p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 are the key cytokines in T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 differentiation and function. Certain allelic variants of these genes significantly influence the risk of psoriasis. Hence we undertook to  study the association of IL-12B and IL-23R gene polymorphisms with disease susceptibility in South Indian Tamil patients with psoriasis. METHODS: 360 psoriatics and 360 healthy controls were included in this case control study. IL-12B gene (rs3212227) and IL-23R gene (rs2201841, rs10889677 and rs11805303) polymorphisms were typed by using TaqMan 5allele discrimination assay and cytokine levels were assayed by ELISA. RESULTS: We observed that the patients carrying the risk genotypes of IL-12B (rs3212227) and IL-23R (rs2201841) conferred an increased susceptibility to psoriasis. We did not find any significant association between IL-23R (rs10889677 and rs11805303) gene polymorphisms and psoriasis risk in South Indian Tamil population. We did not observe any significant difference in haplotypes between the psoriasis cases and controls. We observed a significant increase in the mean  IL-23 levels in psoriatics and the higher levels of IL-23 were found in the minor variant genotype CC when compared with that of heterozygous CT and major variant  TT genotypes of rs2201841. Individual genotypes of rs10889677 and rs11805303 and  IL-12 (rs3212227) were not significantly associated with their plasma levels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that IL-12B (rs3212227) and IL-23R (rs2201841) polymorphisms confer increased risk of psoriasis in our ethnic South Indian Tamils."

Direct comparisons between European  American (EA) and Asian patients with AD are unavailable, but earlier blood studies detected increased IL-17(+)-producing cell counts in Asian patients with  AD. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the Asian AD skin phenotype and compare it with the EA AD skin phenotype. METHODS: We performed genomic profiling (real-time PCR) and immunohistochemistry  on lesional and nonlesional biopsy specimens from 52 patients with AD (25 EAs and 27 Asians), 10 patients with psoriasis (all EAs), and 27 healthy subjects (12 EAs and 15 Asians). RESULTS: Although disease severity/SCORAD scores were similar between the AD groups (58.0 vs 56.7, P = .77), greater acanthosis, higher Ki67 counts, and frequent parakeratosis were characteristics of lesional epidermis from Asian patients with AD (P < .05). Most (24/27) Asian patients had high IgE levels. A principal component analysis using real-time PCR data clustered the Asian AD phenotype between the EA AD and psoriasis phenotypes. TH2 skewing characterized both Asian and EA patients with AD but not patients with psoriasis. Significantly higher TH17 and TH22 (IL17A, IL19, and S100A12 in lesional and IL-22 in nonlesional skin; P < .05) and lower TH1/interferon (CXCL9, CXCL10, MX1, and IFNG in nonlesional skin; P < .05) gene induction typified AD skin in Asian patients. CONCLUSION: The Asian AD phenotype presents (even in the presence of increased IgE levels) a blended phenotype between that of EA patients with AD and those with psoriasis, including increased hyperplasia, parakeratosis, higher TH17 activation, and a strong TH2 component. The relative pathogenic contributions of  the TH17 and TH2 axes in creating the Asian AD phenotype need to be tested in future clinical trials with appropriate targeted therapeutics."

However, the effects of Pelargonium sidoides and a special extract prepared from its roots (EPs 7630) on human immune cells are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that EPs 7630 induced a rapid and dose-dependent production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 by human blood immune cells. This EPs 7630-induced cytokine profile was more pro-inflammatory in comparison with the profile induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. The search for EPs 7630 target cells revealed that T-cells did not respond to EPs 7630 stimulation by production of TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-10. Furthermore, pretreatment of T-cells with EPs 7630 did not modulate their TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion during subsequent activation. In  contrast to lymphocytes, monocytes showed clear intracellular TNF-α staining after EPs 7630 treatment. Accordingly, EPs 7630 predominantly provoked activation of MAP kinases and inhibition of p38 strongly reduced the monocyte TNF-α production. The pretreatment of blood immune cells with EPs 7630 lowered their secretion of TNF-α and IL-10 and caused an IL-6 dominant response during second stimulation with viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. In summary, we demonstrate that EPs 7630 activates human monocytes, induces MAP kinase-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in these cells, and specifically modulates their production capacity of mediators known to lead to an increase of acute phase protein production in the liver, neutrophil generation in the bone marrow, and the generation of adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells."

A molecular profile of cytokine pathways in AA tissues is lacking. Although studies have focused on TH1/IFN-γ responses, several observations support a shared genetic background between AA and atopy. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the AA scalp transcriptome and associated biomarkers with comparisons with atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. METHODS: We performed microarray and RT-PCR profiling of 27 lesional and 17 nonlesional scalp samples from patients with AA for comparison with normal scalp  samples (n = 6). AA gene expression was also compared with samples from patients  with lesional or nonlesional AD and those with psoriasis. A fold change of greater than 1.5 and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05 were used for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). RESULTS: We established the AA transcriptomes (lesional vs nonlesional: 734 DEGs  [297 upregulated and 437 downregulated]; lesional vs normal: 4230 DEGs [1980 upregulated and 2250 downregulated]), including many upregulated immune and downregulated hair keratin genes. Equally impressive as upregulation in TH1/interferon markers (IFNG and CXCL10/CXCL9) were those noted in TH2 (IL13, CCL18, CCL26, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and periostin), TH9/IL-9, IL-23 (p40  and p19), and IL-16 mediators (all P < .05). There were no increases in TH17/TH22 markers. Hair keratin (KRT) expressions (ie, KRT86 and KRT85) were significantly  suppressed in lesional skin. Greater scalp involvement (>25%) was associated with greater immune and keratin dysregulation and larger abnormalities in nonlesional  scalp samples (ie, CXCL10 and KRT85). CONCLUSIONS: Our data associate the AA signature with TH2, TH1, IL-23, and IL-9/TH9 cytokine activation, suggesting consideration of anti-TH2, anti-TH1, and anti-IL-23 targeting strategies.

Monocytes, categorized into three populations based on the cell surface expression of CD14 and CD16, are activated in psoriasis guttate and are commonly triggered by streptococcal infections. Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a major cell-wall component of streptococcus, and an increasing number of PGN-containing cells have been detected in psoriasis. Since there are independent reports of both PGN and LL-37 influencing monocytes, we tried to evaluate the effect of human LL-37 on PGN-induced monocyte activity and differentiation and subsequently studied their correlation with the pathogenesis  of psoriasis guttate. The results revealed that monocytes from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals resulted in their polarization toward the CD14(high)CD16(+) subset, when cultured with PGN in the presence of the LL-37 peptide. This peptide further induced PGN-driven differentiated monocytes into immature dendritic cells (iDC), as evident by the increased expression of CD1a, CD86, and HLA-DR markers, resulting in the induction of T cell proliferation and  Th17 polarization. Furthermore, our data suggested that psoriasis guttata patients have significantly higher percentages of CD14(high)CD16(+) monocytes as  well as circulating levels of LL-37, soluble form of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM-1) levels, and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) levels, as compared to healthy controls. Psoriasis guttata patients also showed a positive correlation between the percentage of CD14(high)CD16(+) monocytes and the serum levels of sTREM-1 as well as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores. Therefore, we concluded that LL-37 in synergy with PGN directs monocyte polarization and differentiation into a proinflammatory phenotype, which might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

The bispecific molecule AZ17 was created by combining high affinity binding domains originating from monoclonal antibodies targeting human IL-6 and IL-23. To allow for high and efficient production, AZ17 was assembled by site-specific bioconjugation from two individual single chain fragment variables that were synthesized separately in Escherichia coli. To improve stability and extend pharmacokinetics, a flexible poly-ethylene glycol molecule was used as linker. In preclinical psoriasis models, AZ17 reduced IL-23-induced ear inflammation and improved psoriasis in a xenograft transplantation model where psoriasis skin is transplanted onto immune-deficient mice. The data presented here suggest AZ17 to  be a promising drug candidate in psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases associated with Th17 cell development."

CBP30 also inhibited IL-17A secretion by Th17 cells from healthy donors and patients with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic  arthritis. Transcriptional profiling of human T cells after CBP30 treatment showed a much more restricted effect on gene expression than that observed with the pan-BET (bromo and extraterminal domain protein family) bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. This selective targeting of the CBP/p300 bromodomain by CBP30 will potentially lead to fewer side effects than with the broadly acting epigenetic inhibitors currently in clinical trials."

Epub 2015 Aug 5.","IL-27-induced modulation of autoimmunity and its therapeutic potential.","Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a new member of the IL-12 family. It is produced by activated antigen-presenting cells and plays an important role in the regulation  of CD4+ T cell differentiation and immune response. IL-27 activates multiple signaling cascades, including the JAK-STAT and p38 MAPK pathways. Several studies have revealed that IL-27 promotes the differentiation of Th1 and Tr1, but inhibits Th2, Th17, and Treg cells. However, a few studies have shown an opposite effect on certain T cell subsets, such as Treg. IL-27 displays both pro- and anti- inflammatory activities in different autoimmune diseases. Here, we have discussed the role of IL-27 in rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, colitis, lupus, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, and uveitis. Most of this information is derived from experimental models of these autoimmune diseases. The mechanistic basis of the dual role of IL-27 in inflammation and autoimmunity is still not fully defined. In general, the pro-/anti-inflammatory activity of IL-27 is influenced by the underlying immune effector pathways, the phase of the disease,  the presence or absence of counter-regulatory cytokines/T cell subsets, and the tissue/cell type under study. Despite a spectrum of outcomes in various autoimmune diseases, mostly anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of IL-27 have been observed in this category of diseases. Accordingly, IL-27 represents a novel, promising target/agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases."

METHODS: In this study, by flow cytometry, real-time PCR, confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry analyses, TL1A and DR3 were investigated in the pulmonary cells and the peripheral blood of 43 patients affected by sarcoidosis in different phases of the disease (29 patients with active sarcoidosis, 14 with the inactive form) and in 8 control subjects. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated a significant higher expression, both at protein and mRNA levels, of TL1A and DR3 in pulmonary T cells and alveolar macrophages of patients with active sarcoidosis as compared to patients with the  inactive form of the disease and to controls. In patients with sarcoidosis TL1A was strongly more expressed in the lung than the blood, i.e., at the site of the  involved organ. Additionally, zymography assays showed that TL1A is able to increase the production of matrix metalloproteinase 9 by sarcoid alveolar macrophages characterized, in patients with the active form of the disease, by reduced mRNA levels of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that TL1A/DR3 interactions are part of the extended and complex immune-inflammatory network that characterizes sarcoidosis during its active phase and may contribute to the pathogenesis and to the progression of the disease."

Here we describe the many known genetic predispositions of psoriasis with respect to immune genes and their encoded pathways in psoriasis susceptibility. These genes  span an array of functions that involve antigen presentation (HLA-Cw6, ERAP1, ERAP2, MICA), the IL-23 axis (IL12Bp40, IL23Ap19, IL23R, JAK2, TYK2), T-cell development and T-cells polarization (RUNX1, RUNX3, STAT3, TAGAP, IL4, IL13), innate immunity (CARD14, c-REL, TRAF3IP2, DDX58, IFIH1), and negative regulators  of immune responses (TNIP1, TNFAIP3, NFKBIA, ZC3H12C, IL36RN, SOCS1). The contribution of some of these gene products to psoriatic disease has also been revealed in recent years through targeting of key immune components, such as the  Th17/IL-23 axis which has been highly successful in disease treatment. However, many of the genetic findings involve immune genes with less clear roles in psoriasis pathogenesis. This is particularly the case for those genes involved in innate immunity and negative regulation of immune specific pathways. It is possible that risk alleles of these genes decrease the threshold for the initial  activation of the innate immune response. This could then lead to the onslaught of the pathogenic adaptive immune response known to be active in psoriatic skin.  However, precisely how these various genes affect immunobiology need to be determined and some are speculated upon in this review. These novel genetic findings also open opportunities to explore novel therapeutic targets and potentially the development of personalized medicine, as well as discover new biology of human skin disease."

The Th17 pathway has been historically associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Among Th17 cytokines, pathogenic roles of IL-17A and IL-17F in asthma have been well described. Recently, the number of peripheral blood Th17 cells was found to correlate with disease severity in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). This study aimed to investigate serum IL-17F levels in children with AD and to correlate this with severity of the disease. Methods: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure IL-17F levels in the sera of 228 patients with AD and 62 control children. The SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) tool was used to determine the severity of disease. Results: The mean serum level of IL-17F in children with AD was significantly higher than that in the control group (p<0.05) Serum IL-17F levels  were also higher in patients with severe AD than in those with mild AD (p<0.001), and IL-17F levels and SCORAD scores were positively correlated (p<0.05). Conclusions: Serum IL-17F level might be a useful marker in children with AD."

IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-21 and interferon (INF)-γ were measured using a multiplex bead immunoassay in SF from PsA patients and peripheral blood (PB) from healthy controls (HC). Frequencies of CD4(+)CD25(-), CD4(+)CD25(high) FOXP3(+) and CD4(+)CD25(high) CD127(low) Treg, and either mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of FOXP3(+) on CD4(+) Treg or MFI of classic IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) α expression on CD4(+)CD25(-) helper/effector T cells (Th/eff) and Treg cells, were quantified in SF of PsA patients and in PB from HC by flow cytometry (FC). In PsA SF samples, IL-2, IL-21 and IFN-γ were not detectable, whereas IL-6 and IL-1β levels were higher than in SF of non-inflammatory osteoarthritis patients. Higher levels of IL-23R-, FOXP3- and RORγt proteins and  JAK1, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 were found in total T cells from SF of PsA patients  compared with PB from HC.

Here, we present a  multiple sclerosis (MS) patient treated with interferon-β who developed new-onset psoriasis. Both her MS as well as her psoriasis finally responded to treatment with fumarates. This case illustrates that interferons not only cause local but also systemic adverse events of the skin. These systemic side effects might indicate that the Th17/IL-17 axis plays a prominent role in the immunopathogenesis of this individual case and that the autoimmune process might  be deteriorated by further administration of interferons. In conclusion, we think that neurologists should be aware of systemic cutaneous side effects and have a closer look on interferon-associated skin lesions. Detection of psoriasiform lesions might indicate that interferons are probably not beneficial in the individual situation. We suggest that skin lesions may serve as biomarkers to allocate MS patients to adequate disease-modifying drugs."

Psoriasis and cardiovascular disease share similar pathogenic mechanisms such as vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome. 25-hydroxy vitamin D is an immune-regulatory hormone, with the ability to reduce cellular proliferation in psoriasis. Ischaemia-modified albumin (IMA) is a marker of oxidative stress. This study examined 25-hydroxy vitamin D, IMA and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with psoriasis, in comparison with healthy controls and their possible association with disease severity. A total of 43 cases of psoriasis and 43 controls were included in this  cross-sectional study, and severity grading was performed according to psoriasis  area severity index (PASI) scoring. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D, IMA and hs-CRP were evaluated in all study subjects. In psoriasis, 25-hydroxy vitamin D showed a significant decline, while hs-CRP and IMA levels were significantly elevated, as  compared with controls. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D showed a significant negative  correlation with PASI score. hs-CRP and IMA showed a significant positive correlation with PASI score. Significant negative correlation was observed between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and hs-CRP; 25-hydroxy vitamin D and IMA levels in psoriasis. The results indicate that psoriasis is associated with significantly lowered 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, along with increased systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, especially in severe disease. Thus, vitamin D supplementation might reduce systemic inflammation and oxidative stress and help  in delaying the pathogenesis of co-morbidities associated with psoriasis."

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of topical INCB018424 phosphate cream in patients with plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Topical INCB018424 phosphate 1·0% or 1·5% cream was applied once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) for 4 weeks to 2-20% body surface area in five sequential cohorts of five patients aged 18-65 years. Target lesions were scored  on a scale of 0-4 for erythema, scaling and thickness. Additionally, the overall  disease activity in each patient was measured using Physicians Global Assessment. INCB018424 concentrations were measured in plasma, and cytokine stimulated phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation (pSTAT3) levels in peripheral blood cells were evaluated. Pretreatment and post-treatment skin biopsies were compared with healthy skin, including evaluation of histopathology, immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression. RESULTS: Treatment with INCB018424 phosphate cream either 1·0% QD or 1·5% BID resulted in improvements in lesion scores. No significant inhibition of pSTAT3 in peripheral blood cells was observed following topical application, consistent with the generally low steady-state plasma concentrations of INCB018424 measured. Transcriptional markers of immune cell lineage/activation in lesional skin were reduced by topical INCB018424, with correlations observed between clinical improvement and decreases in markers of T helper 17 lymphocyte activation, dendritic-cell activation and epidermal hyperplasia. INCB018424 treatment reduced epidermal hyperplasia and dermal inflammation in most patient samples, with reductions in CD3, CD11c, Ki67 and keratin 16 observed by immunohistochemical analysis.

OBJECTIVES: In view of the role of Th17 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the present study was conducted to investigate the effects of DMF on Th1, Th2, and Th17 responses in patients. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from psoriasis  patients and healthy individuals and were cultured in the presence or absence of  phytohemagglutinin and DMF. The cell supernatants were removed to measure cytokine secretion, and the lymphocytes were used for real-time polymerase chain  reaction to establish gene expression. RESULTS: An increase in gene expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), as a marker for  Th1 activity, and interleukin-17 (IL-17), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-22 representing the Th17 subset in the  PBMCs of patients in comparison with those of control subjects was observed. Culture of PBMCs from psoriasis patients and controls in the presence of DMF decreased IFN-γ and increased IL-4 gene expression in both groups. Treatment with DMF could significantly decrease IL-17, GM-CSF, and IL-22 mRNA levels in the PBMCs of patients. Decreased release of IFN-γ and GM-CSF cytokine secretion after DMF treatment was also observed in PBMC cultures of patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data show the effectiveness of DMF in modulating Th17 cells in addition to Th1/Th2 cells and reflect one of the underlying mechanisms of action  of DMF in psoriasis. These findings may also support the possible benefits of using fumarate in the treatment of other autoimmune diseases in the pathogeneses  of which Th1 and Th17 cells play major roles."

The cells were first identified by their ability to produce interleukin 17A (IL-17A)  and, subsequently, associated with chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. Th17 cells have some gene profile similarity with stem cells and can remain dormant in mucosal tissues for long periods. Indeed, recent studies suggest that functionally distinct subsets of pro- and anti-inflammatory Th17 cells can interchange phenotype and functions. For development, Th17 cells require activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and RORγt while RUNX1, c-Maf, and Aiolos are involved in changes of phenotype/functions. Attempts to harness Th17 cells against pathogens and cancer using vaccination strategies are being explored. The cells gain protective abilities when induced to produce interferon  γ (IFNγ). In addition, treatment with antibodies to IL-17 is effective in treating patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and refectory rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, since RORγt is a nuclear receptor, it is likely to be a potential future drug target for modulating Th17 functions.

The diagnosis of PsA is mainly clinical and diagnostic biomarkers are not yet available. The aim of this work was to clarify some aspects of the disease pathogenesis and to identify specific gene signatures in paired peripheral blood cells (PBC) and synovial biopsies of patients with PsA. Moreover, we tried to identify biomarkers that can be used in clinical practice. METHODS: PBC and synovial biopsies of 10 patients with PsA were used to study gene expression using Affymetrix arrays. The expression values were validated by  Q-PCR, FACS analysis and by the detection of soluble mediators. RESULTS: Synovial biopsies of patients showed a modulation of approximately 200 genes when compared to the biopsies of healthy donors. Among the differentially expressed genes we observed the upregulation of Th17 related genes and of type I  interferon (IFN) inducible genes. FACS analysis confirmed the Th17 polarization.  Moreover, the synovial trascriptome shows gene clusters (bone remodeling, angiogenesis and inflammation) involved in the pathogenesis of PsA. Interestingly 90 genes are modulated in both compartments (PBC and synovium) suggesting that signature pathways in PBC mirror those of the inflamed synovium. Finally the osteoactivin gene was upregulared in both PBC and synovial biopsies and this finding was confirmed by the detection of high levels of osteoactivin in PsA sera but not in other inflammatory arthritides. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the first analysis of the trancriptome in paired synovial tissue and PBC of patients with PsA. This study strengthens the hypothesis that PsA is of autoimmune origin since the coactivity of IFN and Th17  pathways is typical of autoimmunity. Finally these findings have allowed the identification of a possible disease biomarker, osteoactivin, easily detectable in PsA serum."

A crucial outcome of glucocorticoid exposure is induction of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a protein with multiple functions that include inhibition of key immune cell signalling pathways. Here we report that GILZ maintains a threshold for activation of Th17 responses and IL-17-dependent pathology. GILZ expression was deficient in lesional skin of psoriasis patients and was negatively correlated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-23, IL-17A and IL-22, and with STAT3 expression. Deficiency of GILZ in mice resulted in excessive inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the imiquimod model of psoriasis, and dendritic cells lacking GILZ produced greater IL-1, IL-23 and IL-6 in response to imiquimod stimulation in vitro. These cytokines stimulate Th17 cell differentiation, and we found unchallenged GILZ-deficient mice to have spontaneous production of IL-17A and IL-22 in vivo. We also identified a T cell-intrinsic role for GILZ in limiting Th17 cell formation in vitro in response to Th17-promoting cytokines IL-1β and IL-23. Addition of IL-6 under these conditions suppressed GILZ, allowing T cell proliferation and expression of Th17  genes, whereas exogenous delivery of GILZ using a cell-permeable fusion protein restored regulation of Th17 cell proliferation. Thus, GILZ has a non-redundant function to constrain pathogenic Th17 responses, with clinical implications for psoriasis."

Nonetheless, Th17 cells appear crucial to both diseases, and IL23 is the cytokine involved in determining the fate of naive CD4+ cells to differentiate into a pathogenic phenotype. This basic experimental observation led to a clear understanding of the immune dysfunction causing psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but, more importantly, also led to new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, monoclonal antibodies directed to IL12/IL23 (ustekinumab) or IL17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab) are being investigated or have proven to be beneficial for patients with psoriatic disease, thus further supporting the view that Th17 cells play a pivotal role in disease onset and perpetuation. These most recent reports indeed represent significant developments that may allow overcoming the TNFα pathway as the major therapeutic target in chronic inflammation."

Epub 2015 May 18.","Interleukin-17 and innate immunity in infections and chronic inflammation.","Interleukin 17 (IL-17) includes several cytokines among which IL-17A is considered as one of the major pro-inflammatory cytokine being central to the innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-17 is produced by unconventional T cells, members of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), mast cells, as well as typical innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages located in the epithelial barriers and characterised by a rapid response to infectious agents by recruiting neutrophils as first line of defence and inducing the production of antimicrobial peptides. Th17 responses appear pivotal in chronic and acute infections by bacteria, parasites, and fungi, as well as in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis. The data discussed in this review cumulatively indicate that innate-derived IL-17 constitutes a major element in the altered immune response against self antigens or the perpetuation of inflammation, particularly at mucosal sites. New drugs targeting the IL17 pathway include brodalumab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab and their use in psoriatic disease is expected to dramatically impact our approach to this systemic condition."

Serum levels of IL-33 have been reported to be upregulated in various T helper (Th)1/Th17-mediated diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. IL-33 expression is increased in lesional skin in patients with psoriasis, but serum levels in patients with psoriasis have not yet been studied. AIM: To study serum IL-33 levels in patients with psoriasis, a Th1/Th17-mediated  skin disease, before and after anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α therapy. METHODS: Serum IL-33 levels were measured in patients with psoriasis vulgaris (PV), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or pustular psoriasis (PP), and compared with those of healthy controls. Associations between serum IL-33 levels and serum TNF-α, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor and C-reactive protein levels were also studied. In addition, the effect of IL-33 stimulation on IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and VEGF secretion by human keratinocyte was analysed. RESULTS: Serum IL-33 levels in patients with PV, PsA and PP were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Serum IL-33 levels correlated with serum TNF-α levels in patients with psoriasis, and decreased after anti-TNF-α therapy.  IL-33 stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 secretion by human keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that serum IL-33 levels generally reflect increased inflammation in patients with psoriasis."

Pharmacodynamic effects of apremilast on plasma biomarkers associated with inflammation were evaluated in a PALACE 1 substudy. Of 504 patients randomized in PALACE 1, 150 (placebo: n = 51; apremilast 20 mg BID: n =  51; apremilast 30 mg BID: n = 48) provided peripheral blood plasma samples for analysis in a multiplexed cytometric bead array assay measuring 47 proteins associated with systemic inflammatory immune responses. Association between biomarker levels and achievement of 20% improvement from baseline in modified American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response criteria was assessed by logistic regression. At Week 24, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-1β, MCP-1, and ferritin were significantly reduced from baseline with apremilast 20 mg BID or 30 mg BID versus placebo. ACR20 response correlated with change in TNF-α level with both apremilast doses. At Week 40, IL-17, IL-23, IL-6, and ferritin were significantly decreased and IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonists significantly increased with apremilast 30 mg BID versus placebo. In patients with active psoriatic arthritis, apremilast reduced circulating levels of Th1 and Th17 proinflammatory mediators and increased anti-inflammatory mediators."

Estrogen has been hypothesized to contribute to these changes by creating a shift from Th1 and Th17 to Th2 immunity. As this hypothesis would predict, psoriasis (a primarily Th17 mediated immune disease) tends to improve during pregnancy. However, the precise  mechanism by which estrogen induces immunological change in psoriasis remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the immunologic effects of estrogen as they relate to psoriasis during pregnancy. METHODS: We performed an English-language PubMed search of articles from September 2004 to September 2014 combining the key terms psoriasis, estrogen, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy. RESULTS: Estrogen appears to up-regulate Th2 cytokines and down-regulate Th1 and  Th17 cytokines. This shift was initially observed in murine systems, which showed decreased mixed lymphocyte reactions of splenocytes and increased antibody production during pregnancy. Antigen stimulated splenocytes produced fewer Th1 cytokines and more Th2 cytokines in pregnant mice. IL17 producing T cells were significantly decreased in healthy pregnancies compared to non-pregnant controls. LIMITATIONS: This review is limited by the paucity of studies evaluating immunological changes of psoriasis in pregnancy among human subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Increased estrogen production in pregnancy is associated with decreased Th1 and Th17 cytokine production. While estrogen may be responsible for some of these immune shifts resulting in disease improvement, there remains no definitive evidence to prove the hypothesis that estrogen is responsible for such improvement."

The chronic inflammatory state of psoriasis with exacerbations and remissions necessitate on-and-off treatment schedules. The safety profiles of drugs and tolerability issues for patients are important factors to be considered during treatment. Various biological agents targeting T-cells and the inflammatory cytokines are available for systemic treatment of psoriasis. However, major causes of concern while using these drugs are risk of susceptibility to infection and development of anti-drug antibodies, which will affect the pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy, and safety profile of the drug. Itolizumab, a humanized anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody, is a new molecule that acts by immunomodulating the CD6 molecule. CD6 is a co-stimulatory molecule required for optimal T-cell stimulation by the antigen-presenting cells. This step is crucial in T-cell proliferation to form Th1 and Th17 cells, which play a major role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This article deals with the properties of Itolizumab and its role in the treatment of psoriasis. Based on the available published data, Itolizumab seems to have a better adverse effects profile and at the same time comparatively less efficacy when compared to other biological agents available for treating psoriasis. Larger studies with longer duration are required to clearly depict the long-term side effects profile."

Psoriatic disease is an autoimmune disease which mainly involves skin and joints. Until recently, psoriasis and PsA were thought to be Th1 mediated disease, but after the discovery of IL-17 and IL-17 knockout animal studies as well as human experimental data indicate a crucial role of the Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA. Our research group have not only found abundance of CD4(+)IL-17(+) T cells, mainly the memory phenotype (CD4RO(+)CD45RA(-)CD11a(+)) in the synovial fluid, but also have shown the existence of a functional IL-17 receptor in synovial fibroblast of psoriatic arthritis patients. Similarly, both  animal and human studies indicate a regulatory role of the Th17 cells in AS; most critical observations are that Th17 cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22) can contribute to bone erosion, osteitis and new bone formation the hall mark skeletal features associated with the pathophysiology of AS. In this review article, we have discussed the contributing role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the pathogenesis of PsA and AS."

Indeed, the pathogenesis in psoriasis is still not fully understood and it is speculated that cytokines other than TNF-α are important in subsets of  patients. Also, for patients with severe disease that are treated with systemic anti-TNF-α blockade, novel candidates to be used as disease and response biomarkers are of high interest. Here, we demonstrate TL1A expression in biopsies from psoriatic lesions. Also, we investigated spontaneous and induced TL1A secretion from PBMCs and blood levels from a cohort of psoriasis patients. Here,  increased spontaneous secretion from PBMCs was observed as compared to healthy controls and a small subset of patients had highly elevated TL1A in the blood. Interestingly, activation of PBMCs with various cytokines showed a decreased sensitivity for TL1A activation in psoriasis patients compared to healthy controls.TL1A levels in blood and biopsies could not be correlated with disease activity with this patient cohort.

Although a global transcriptional regulatory network of Th17  cell differentiation has been mapped recently, the participation of epigenetic modifications in the differentiation process has yet to be elucidated. We demonstrated here that histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) demethylation, predominantly  mediated by the H3K27 demethylase Jmjd3, crucially regulated Th17 cell differentiation. Activation of naïve CD4(+) T cells immediately induced high expression of Jmjd3. Genetic depletion of Jmjd3 in CD4(+) T cells specifically impaired Th17 cell differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic expression  of Jmjd3 largely rescued the impaired differentiation of Th17 cells in vitro in Jmjd3-deficient CD4(+) T cells. Importantly, Jmjd3-deficient mice were resistant  to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Furthermore, inhibition of the H3K27 demethylase activity with the specific inhibitor GSK-J4 dramatically suppressed Th17 cell differentiation in vitro. At the molecular level, Jmjd3 directly bound to and reduced the level of H3K27 trimethylation (me3) at the genomic sites of Rorc, which encodes the master Th17 transcription factor Rorγt, and Th17 cytokine genes such as Il17, Il17f, and Il22. Therefore, our studies established a critical role of Jmjd3-mediated H3K27 demethylation in  Th17 cell differentiation and suggest that Jmjd3 can be a novel therapeutic target for suppressing autoimmune responses."

We found that expression levels of CCR6 on human effector/memory CD4(+) T cells reflect a  continuum of Th17 differentiation. By evaluating the transcriptome in cells with  increasing CCR6, we detected progressive upregulation of ZBTB16, which encodes the broad complex, tramtrack, bric-à-brac-zinc finger transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation for modified histones, p300, and PLZF, we identified enhancer-like sites at -9/-10 and -13/-14 kb from the upstream transcription start site of CCR6 that bind PLZF in CCR6(+) cells. For Th cells from adult blood, both in the CCR6(+) memory population and in naive cells activated ex vivo, knockdown of ZBTB16 downregulated CCR6 and other Th17-associated genes. ZBTB16 and RORC (which encodes the master regulator RORγt) cross-regulate each  other, and PLZF binds at the RORC promoter in CCR6(+) cells. In naive Th cells from cord blood, ZBTB16 expression was confined to CD161(+) cells, which are Th17 cell precursors. ZBTB16 was not expressed in mouse Th17 cells, and Th17 cells could be made from luxoid mice, which harbor an inactivating mutation in Zbtb16.  These studies demonstrate a role for PLZF as an activator of transcription important both for Th17 differentiation and the maintenance of the Th17 phenotype in human cells, expand the role of PLZF as a critical regulator in the human adaptive immune system, and identify a novel, essential element in a regulatory network that is of significant therapeutic interest."

We examined the clinical and immunological response patterns of 100 subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis receiving 3 different intravenous dosing regimens of the anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab (1 × 3 mg/kg or 1 × 10 mg/kg on Day 1, or 3 × 10 mg/kg on Days 1, 15 and 29) or placebo in a phase 2 trial. Baseline biopsies revealed typical features of active psoriasis, including epidermal accumulation of neutrophils and formation of microabscesses in >60% of  cases. Neutrophils were the numerically largest fraction of infiltrating cells containing IL-17 and may store the cytokine preformed, as IL-17A mRNA was not detectable in neutrophils isolated from active plaques. Significant clinical responses to secukinumab were observed 2 weeks after a single infusion, associated with extensive clearance of cutaneous neutrophils parallel to the normalization of keratinocyte abnormalities and reduction of IL-17-inducible neutrophil chemoattractants (e.g. CXCL1, CXCL8); effects on numbers of T cells and CD11c-positive dendritic cells were more delayed. Histological and immunological improvements were generally dose dependent and not observed in the  placebo group. In the lowest-dose group, a recurrence of neutrophils was seen in  some subjects at Week 12; these subjects relapsed faster than those without microabscesses. Our findings are indicative of a neutrophil-keratinocyte axis in  psoriasis that may involve neutrophil-derived IL-17 and is an early target of IL-17A-directed therapies such as secukinumab."

Targeting these mediators has been suggested as a potential therapeutic option in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we found CCL7, a chemokine ligand known to interact with multiple C-C chemokine receptors, to be markedly increased in lesional psoriasis as opposed to atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, non-lesional psoriatic  and normal control skin. Surprisingly, this increase in CCL7 mRNA expression exceeded that of all other chemokines investigated, and keratinocytes and dermal  blood endothelial cells were identified as its likely cellular sources. In an imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model, CCL7 had a profound impact on myeloid cell inflammation as well as on the upregulation of key pro-psoriatic cytokines such as CCL20, IL-12p40 and IL-17C, while its blockade led to an increase in the antipsoriatic cytokine IL-4. In humans receiving the TNF-α-blocker infliximab, CCL7 was downregulated in lesional psoriatic skin already within 16 hours after a single intravenous infusion. These data suggest that CCL7 acts as a driver of TNF-α-dependent Th1/Th17-mediated inflammation in lesional psoriatic skin."

Currently, the combined use of two other systemic drugs often has better therapeutic efficacy and is safer than low or high dose of a single drug. Glucosamine (Glu) also has immunomodulatory properties for autoimmune diseases. The aims of our study were to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Glu in combination with low-dose CsA on imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis in mice and to determine its immunomodulatory mechanism.

We aimed to identify the risk factors for adverse skin lesions in patients with IBD receiving anti-TNF agents and assess the effect of concomitant use of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine (AZA/6 MP). METHODS: A total of 500 patients (404 with Crohns disease, 96 with ulcerative colitis) who received anti-TNF agents between June 2002 and July 2013 were identified and retrospectively investigated. We compared 47 patients with IBD with skin lesions with 443 patients with IBD without skin lesions to identify risk factors by univariate and multivariate analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of adverse skin lesions in relation to  the concomitant use of AZA/6 MP. RESULTS: Eczematiform eruptions (n = 18, 38%) were the most common skin lesion type, followed by psoriasiform lesions (n = 13, 28%). A response to topical steroids was seen in 70% (33/47) of patients with skin lesions, and anti-TNF agents had to be discontinued in 9% (4/47). Concomitant use of AZA/6 MP decreased the risk of skin lesions in univariate (hazard ratio, 0.452; 95% CI, 0.251-0.814; P = 0.008) and multivariate (hazard ratio, 0.437; 95% CI, 0.242-0.790; P = 0.006) analysis. In addition, the cumulative incidence of adverse skin lesions was lower in patients on concomitant maintenance with AZA/6 MP (P = 0.009) than in those on anti-TNF monotherapy.

To explain the clinical differences of the diseases, it has been proposed that Th2/Th22-polarized immune status together with an attenuated Th17 axis may cause insufficient induction of antimicrobial peptides and more severe barrier dysfunction in AD. While skin barrier dysfunction is commonly seen in AD and psoriasis, a Th2-dominant cytokine milieu down-regulates immunity against infections, which are commonly seen in lesional skin of AD. In the era of biologics, increase in the understanding or new discoveries of molecules involved in the development of various diseases will instantly lead to a new therapeutic strategy. In this review, we give an overview of recent advances in AD and psoriasis, especially on genetic background, barrier function, and therapeutic targets."

Although psoriasis and AD show histopathologic differences during chronic disease, they are difficult to distinguish histologically during erythrodermic exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the immune phenotype of helper T cells can differentiate erythrodermic psoriasis and erythrodermic AD by studying skin biopsy specimens of patients with psoriasis and AD during erythrodermic and chronic disease phases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective study using biopsy samples of psoriasis, AD, and erythroderma belonging to the surgical pathology files of the James Homer Wright Pathology Laboratories, Massachusetts General Hospital, and collected from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2011.  Samples were obtained from patients with chronic psoriasis (n = 20), chronic AD (n = 20), erythroderma subsequently diagnosed as psoriasis (n = 7), and erythroderma subsequently diagnosed as AD (n = 5). We evaluated immunohistochemical stains for CD3 and dual stains for CD4 and T-bet, GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), or basonuclin 2 (BNC2), which are transcription factors reported to be specific and mutually exclusive for TH1, TH2, TH17, and TH22 cells, respectively. Two investigators independently counted CD3+ cells and dual-labeled CD4+/T-bet+,  CD4+/GATA3+, CD4+/STAT3+, and CD4+/BNC2+ cells in 5 consecutive high-power fields. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We evaluated the percentage of TH1, TH2, TH17, and TH22 cells in CD3+ T cells and the TH1:TH2 ratio in chronic psoriasis, chronic AD, erythrodermic psoriasis, and erythrodermic AD. RESULTS: We found a significant difference in the TH1:TH2 ratio between chronic psoriasis and chronic AD (0.26 and 0.09, respectively; P = .005). However, we detected no significant difference in the percentage of TH1 (6.5% and 4.8%), TH2  (55.2% and 64.6%), TH17 (14.7% and 30.4%), and TH22 (3.8% and 3.3%) cells of CD3+ T cells or in the TH1:TH2 ratio (0.16 and 0.07) within biopsy specimens from patients with erythrodermic psoriasis and AD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study confirms the TH1- and TH2-skewed phenotype  of chronic psoriasis and chronic AD, respectively. However, the immune phenotype, as determined by immunohistochemical analysis, cannot discriminate between these  inflammatory diseases in the erythrodermic phase. These findings advance our understanding of the pathophysiological characteristics of erythroderma, psoriasis, and AD and may influence therapeutic decisions."

We describe the rare occurrence of unstable psoriasis (with onset of pustular lesions) in a case of APS I without mucocutaneous candidiasis. A patient presenting with unstable psoriasis (with onset of pustular lesions) was detected  to have persistent hypocalcemia which led to the diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism. Subsequently he was found to have hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism, primary adrenal insufficiency (compensated), and coeliac disease, thus confirming the diagnosis of APS I. Psoriasis is very rarely reported in APS I, possibly due to the protective effect of antibodies to Th17 cytokines, which are responsible for  the occurrence of candidiasis in this syndrome. However, psoriasis could occur in APS I patients without mucocutaneous candidiasis, who lack these antibodies. In our patient, possible factors aggravating psoriasis include hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism as well as coeliac disease via anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. However, defining psoriasis as a possible minor component of APS I would require further studies of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene functions."

It was suggested that the interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17A cytokine axis played a critical role in the pathogenesis of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA)-induced K14-VEGF transgenic psoriasis-like mice model. Here, we report that topical use of a curcumin gel formulation inhibited TPA-induced Th1 inflammation in K14-VEGF transgenic mice ears but not Th17 inflammation as expected. Real-time PCR showed that mRNA levels of IL-23, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-6 and TNFα cytokines failed to increase after TPA-induction in K14-VEGF transgenic mice ear skin; but the mRNA level of IFNγ increased significantly at the same time. Furthermore, TPA-induction up-regulated the TCRγδ protein but failed to impact the CCR6 protein, which means that the proliferation of γδ T cells is incapable of IL-17A production. We find that curcumin is capable of relieving TPA-induced inflammation by directly down-regulating IFNγ production. In conclusion, curcumin inhibits TPA-induced Th1 inflammation in K14-VEGF transgenic mice which has not been previously described."

We investigated the role of OPN in OPN deficient mice (OPN-/-) by inducing psoriasis-like inflammation through skin application of imiquimod (IMQ). OPN-/- mice treated with IMQ showed delayed onset ear swelling and attracted less inflammatory cells  to the skin. IMQ-induced lymph node swelling was reduced in the absence of OPN, and IMQ-mediated expansion of B cells was inhibited. Further, reduction of CD4(+) T-cell numbers by IMQ in lymph nodes was suppressed in OPN-/- mice, with an increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio. A comparable pattern was found in spleen. Importantly, IMQ-induced IL-17 and IL-4 expression by CD4(+) lymph node T cells was reduced in OPN-/- mice. In conclusion, OPN may modulate psoriasis-like inflammation through altering lymphocyte distribution in skin and draining lymph  nodes and by inducing IL-17 expression of inflammatory T cells."

Despite the broadly documented antiinflammatory effect of IL-4, the underlying mode of action remains incompletely understood, as IL-4 also promotes IL-12 production by dendritic cells (DCs) and IFN-γ-producing T(H)1 cells in vivo. Studying the impact of IL-4 on the polarization of human and mouse DCs, we found that IL-4 exerts opposing effects on the production of either IL-12 or IL-23. While promoting IL-12-producing capacity of DCs, IL-4 completely abrogates IL-23. Bone  marrow chimeras proved that IL-4-mediated suppression of DTHRs relies on the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6)-dependent abrogation of IL-23 in antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, IL-4 therapy attenuated DTHRs by  STAT6- and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3)-dependent suppression of the  IL-23/T(H)17 responses despite simultaneous enhancement of IL-12/TH1 responses. As IL-4 therapy also improves psoriasis in humans and suppresses IL-23/T(H)17 responses without blocking IL-12/T(H)1, selective IL-4-mediated IL-23/T(H)17 silencing is promising as treatment against harmful inflammation, while sparing the IL-12-dependent T(H)1 responses."

This  gap is of clinical relevance because these manifestations are clinically relevant to patients. Herein, we discuss new exciting findings in animal models with enthesitis and dactylitis, summarize developments in clinical and imaging assessments and review recent clinical trial data on the efficacy of targeted therapies for enthesitis and dactylitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Several different animal models reveal that cytokines in the interleukin-23/Th17 pathway and mechanical stress are key events in the development of enthesitis and dactylitis. Elevated levels of interleukin-23, generated in the gut, joint or skin, trigger subsequent tissue inflammation. Both enthesitis and dactylitis involve heterogeneous tissues, associate with specific  Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex alleles, and enthesitis may be critical  for the development of PsA, although a causal pathway remains unproven. Diagnosis is based on clinical and imaging assessments; however, Power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) is more sensitive for diagnosis and longitudinal follow-up of enthesitis.  Agents targeting tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-12/23, interleukin-17, interleukin-17 receptor (interleukin-17R) and PDE4 are effective therapies for psoriatic enthesitis and dactylitis. SUMMARY: Novel preclinical models established, for the first time, the importance of the interleukin-23/Th17 pathway and mechanical stress in pathogenesis of dactylitis and enthesitis. Advances in imaging, particular (PDUS), may improve sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and longitudinal assessments. Many targeted therapies are effective for enthesitis and dactylitis."

These diseases include psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the broader category of spondyloarthritides including ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is postulated that in genetically predisposed individuals, external or internal stimuli such as microbial antigens, alterations in the intestinal microbiome, biomechanical stress and/or immunologic dysregulation may lead to an increased expression of cytokines such as IL23, which in turn stimulate the differentiation and activation of TH17 and other immune cells, which are a part of the innate immune system that trigger adaptive immune processes and chronic inflammatory diseases. Herein, we explore the effect of targeting this pathway therapeutically. RECENT FINDINGS: New drugs that are designed to inhibit steps in this pathway, the IL12/IL23 inhibitor, ustekinumab, the IL17A inhibitors secukinumab and ixekizumab, the IL17A receptor inhibitor, brodalumab, and the IL23 inhibitors guselkumab and tildrakizumab, have demonstrated significant effectiveness in treating these diseases, particularly psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. SUMMARY: This article reviews the relevant biology, efficacy and safety of new medications targeting the TH17 pathway, including inhibition of IL17 and IL23, particularly in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Especially for patients who have not gained benefit from, lost effectiveness to or could not use antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) medications for safety or tolerability reasons, having effective medicines with an alternative mechanism of action will improve our ability to diminish disease activity impact on patient lives."

These cells comprise approximately 3% of the pool of circulating T cells, have an effector memory phenotype, and are capable of producing several cytokines. Notably, the MCAM positive cells are enhanced for IL-17 production compared to MCAM negative effector memory T cells. These cells are committed to IL-17 production and do not require in vitro polarization with exogenous cytokines. MCAM positive T cells also demonstrate an increased ability to bind to endothelial monolayers. In numerous autoimmune diseases these cells are found at increased proportions in the peripheral circulation, and at the sites of active inflammation in patients with autoimmune disease, these cells appear in large numbers and are major contributors to IL-17 production. Studies to date have been performed with human  subjects and it is uncertain if appropriate mouse models exist for this cell type. These cells could represent early components of the adaptive immune response and serve as targets of therapy in these diseases, although much work remains to be performed in order to discern the exact nature and function of these cells."

It is well known that macrophages, neutrophils and T-helper 1 (Th1)/T-helper 17 (Th17) cells play important roles in skin lesions by provoking inflammation. Paeoniflorin (PF) is the major effective component extracted from the root of Paeonia lactiflora, which has been widely used in China to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis. Although PF shows a clinical therapeutic effect on psoriasis patients, how PF affects infiltrated immune cells in psoriasis skin lesions is still unknown. In this study, using a generated imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like mouse model, we found that PF ameliorates inflammation and skin lesions. Subsequent analyses showed that PF decreases the number of F4/80(+)CD68(+) macrophages and their related cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)) in the skin of IMQ-challenged mice. Moreover, PF suppresses the number of CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) neutrophils and the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2; a counterpart of human IL-8, which is responsible for the recruitment of neutrophils in mice). Finally, PF also down-regulates Th1- and Th17-related cytokine expression. Therefore, our new findings reveal that PF alleviates psoriatic skin lesions by inhibiting inflammation, which provides new  insights into the immunomodulatory effect of PF in psoriasis treatment."

AREAS COVERED: This review on new therapies in axial and peripheral SpA comprising psoriatic arthritis (PsA) shows, that, in addition to the established  anti-TNF agents infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab and the first biosimilar approved in the EU, there are at least two emerging biologics in the field of SpA: ustekinumab, a compound targeting IL12/IL-23 via the p40 subunit of both cytokines works for psoriasis and PsA and probably also for Crohns disease, and the anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab which has also been  shown to work in psoriasis, both compounds seem to also work in ankylosing spondylitis. In addition, the potential of two small molecules, apremilast a phoshodiesterase4 inhibitor and tofacitinib, a januskinase inhibitor is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Since, in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, the therapeutic array in SpA is currently limited to TNF-blockers, and since there is still an unmet need because some patients do not respond to anti-TNF therapy at all or they loose response, new agents with a different mechanism of action are eagerly awaited."

Because IL-2 may counteract autoimmunity in part by shifting CD4(+) T  helper cells away from the Type 1 T helper cell (TH1) and TH17 subtypes towards the TH2 subtype, the purpose of this study was to determine if blocking Gβγ signaling affected the balance of TH1, TH17, and TH2 cytokine mRNAs produced by CD4(+) T helper cells. METHODS: Gallein, a small molecule inhibitor of Gβγ, and siRNA-mediated silencing of the G-protein β1 subunit (Gβ1) were used to test the effect of blocking Gβγ on mRNA levels of cytokines in primary human TCR-stimulated CD4(+) T helper cells. RESULTS: Gallein and Gβ1 siRNA decreased interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-17A mRNA levels in TCR-stimulated CD4(+) T cells grown under TH1-promoting conditions. Inhibiting Gβγ also decreased mRNA levels of STAT4, which plays a positive role in TH1 differentiation and IL-17A production. Moreover, mRNA levels of the STAT4-regulated TH1-associated proteins, IL-18 receptor β chain (IL-18Rβ), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 (MAP3K8), lymphocyte activation  gene 3 (LAG-3), natural killer cell group 7 sequence (NKG7), and oncostatin M (OSM) were also decreased upon Gβγ inhibition. Gallein also increased IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 mRNA levels in TCR-stimulated memory CD4(+) T cells grown in TH2-promoting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibiting Gβγ to produce these shifts in cytokine mRNA production might be beneficial for patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohns disease (CD), psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Hashimotos thyroiditis (HT), in which both IFN-γ and IL-17A are elevated."

Cyanobacterium aponinum is a dominating member of the Blue Lagoons microbial ecosystem. The aim of the study was to determine whether exopolysaccharides (EPSs) secreted by C. aponinum (EPS-Ca) had immunomodulatory effects in vitro. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were matured in the absence or presence of EPS-Ca and the effects were determined by measuring the secretion of cytokines by ELISA and the expression of surface molecules by flow cytometry. DCs matured with EPS-Ca at 100 μg/ml secreted higher levels of IL-10 than untreated DCs. Subsequently, DCs matured in the presence or absence of EPS-Ca were co-cultured with allogeneic CD4(+) T cells and their effects on T cell activation analysed by measuring expression of intracellular and surface molecules and cytokine secretion. Supernatant from allogeneic T cells co-cultured with EPS-Ca-exposed DCs had raised levels of IL-10 compared with control. A reduced frequency of IL-17(+)RORγt(+) T cells was observed when co-cultured with  EPS-Ca-exposed DCs and a tendency towards increased frequency of FoxP3(+)IL-10(+) T cells, resulting in a lower IL-17(+)RORγt(+)/FoxP3(+)IL-10(+) ratio. The study  shows that EPSs secreted by C. aponinum stimulate DCs to produce vast amounts of  the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. These DCs induce differentiation of allogeneic CD4(+) T cells with an increased Treg but decreased Th17 phenotype. These data suggest that EPSs from C. aponinum may play a role in the beneficial clinical effect on psoriasis following bathing in the Blue Lagoon."

The pathogenesis of SpA encompasses a complex array of genetic, immunological and environmental factors. In this article, we will briefly review the genetics of PsA, and then focus on the genes that may be potentially linked either directly or indirectly to the immunopathology of the Th-17 pathway. The most consistent and dominant genetic effect of PsV and PsA is located on chromosome 6p21.3 within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which accounts for approximately one-third of the genetic contribution of PsV and PsA. To date, 36 genes have reached genome-wide significance, accounting for approximately 22% of  psoriasis (PsV) heritability. Prominent genes identified via GWAS include HLA-Cw6, IL12B, IL23R, IL23A, TNIP1, TNFAIP3, LCE3B-LCE3C, TRAF3IP2, NFkBIA, FBXL19, TYK2, IFIH1, REL, and ERAP1. Genes identified in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has largely echoed those in PsV and include HLA-B/C, HLA-B, IL-12B, IL-23R, TNIP1, TRAF3IP2, FBXL19, and REL. The lack of identified genetic susceptibility loci is largely attributed to the much smaller number of PsA patients and the greater clinical heterogeneity of PsA. Searching for different types of genetic variants such as small CNVs and/or insertions/deletions has also led to the identification of several genes with a function relative to PsV in particular including DEFB4, LCE3C_LCE3B, and IL-22 gene (exon 1). The candidate genes identified in PsV/PsA have highlighted pathways of critical importance to psoriatic disease including distinct signaling pathways comprised of barrier integrity, innate immune response and adaptive immune response, mediated primarily by Th-17 and Th-1 signalling. While GWAS studies have yielded great insights into the genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of PsV and PsA, replication in large cohorts, fine-mapping and resequencing efforts, together with functional studies of genetic variants identified, are warranted to better understand susceptibility to and progression of these diseases. That searching solely for common variants by GWAS will identify only a fraction of the entire genetic burden of disease, a concerted effort is underway to search for highly penetrant but rare disease alleles in families with PsV and PsA, using next-generation sequencing and through epigenetic investigations."

LL37-specific T cells produce IFN-γ, and CD4(+) T cells also produce Th17 cytokines. LL37-specific T cells can infiltrate lesional skin and may be tracked in patients blood by tetramers staining.

Psoriasis is characterized by the keratinocyte proliferation, which is induced by cytokines Th1 and Th17. Patients with plaque psoriasis present a chronic inflammatory response with high levels of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23.  Various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified in the IL12B gene, such as SNP 3 UTR 1188 A/C (SNP rs3212227), which has been associated with susceptibility to developing plaque psoriasis and with the production of IL-12 and IL-23 in individuals of different ethnic groups. In this study, we determined whether there is an association of SNP rs3212227 with the susceptibility of developing plaque psoriasis and with serum levels of IL-12 and IL-23 in Mestizo population in western Mexico. We included 112 patients with psoriasis and 112 clinical healthy individuals in the study. The frequencies of genotypes A/A, A/C, and C/C in patients with plaque psoriasis were 41, 53, and 6%, respectively, while in the control group, these were 37, 53, and 10%, respectively, without finding statistically significant differences between both groups (p>0.05). Although IL-12 and IL-23 serum levels were higher in patients than in controls, we found no significant differences. The group of patients with genotype CC presented the highest levels of IL-23 (p<0.05). These data suggest that the SNP rs3212227 phenotype is not associated with the risk of developing plaque psoriasis or with IL-12 and IL-23 levels in Mestizo population in western Mexico."

Epub 2014 Nov 28.","T cell responses in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.","According to the current view the histological features of psoriasis arise as a consequence of the interplay between T cells, dendritic cells and keratinocytes giving rise to a self-perpetuating loop that amplifies and sustains inflammation  in lesional skin. In particular, myeloid dendritic cell secretion of IL-23 and IL-12 activates IL-17-producing T cells, Th22 and Th1 cells, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF and IL-22. These cytokines mediate effects on keratinocytes thus establishing the inflammatory loop. Unlike psoriasis the immunopathogenic features of psoriatic arthritis are poorly characterized and there is a gap in the knowledge of the pathogenic link between inflammatory T cell responses arising in the skin and the development of  joint inflammation. Here we review the knowledge accumulated over the years from  the early evidence of autoreactive CD8 T cells that was studied mainly in the years 1990s and 2000s to the recent findings of the role of Th17, Tc17 cells and  γδ T cells in psoriatic disease pathogenesis. The review will also focus on common and distinguishing features of T cell responses in psoriatic plaques and in synovial fluid of patients with psoriatic arthritis. The integration of this information could help to distinguish the role played by T cells in the initiation phase of the disease from the role of T cells as downstream effectors  sustaining inflammation in psoriatic plaques and potentially leading to disease manifestation in distant joints."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are differentially expressed in psoriatic skin; however, only few cell- and region-specific miRNAs have been identified in  psoriatic lesions. We used laser capture microdissection (LCM) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to study the specific miRNA expression profiles  in the epidermis (Epi) and dermal inflammatory infiltrates (RD) of psoriatic skin (N = 6). We identified 24 deregulated miRNAs in the Epi and 37 deregulated miRNAs in the RD of psoriatic plaque compared with normal psoriatic skin (FCH > 2, FDR < 0.05). Interestingly, 9 of the 37 miRNAs in RD, including miR-193b and miR-223, were recently described as deregulated in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with psoriasis. Using flow cytometry and  qRT-PCR, we found that miR-193b and miR-223 were expressed in Th17 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that LCM combined with NGS provides a robust approach  to explore the global miRNA expression in the epidermal and dermal compartments of psoriatic skin. Furthermore, our results indicate that the altered local miRNA changes seen in the RD are reflected in the circulating immune cells, suggesting  that miRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

In last few years, several studies have strongly established the regulatory role of Th17 cells and its signature cytokine IL-17 in autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple  sclerosis. Psoriasis and PsA are immune mediated hyperproliferative diseases, affecting skin and joint respectively. Before the discovery of Th17 cells, psoriasis and psoriatic diseases were thought to be chiefly Th1 mediated diseases; later on IL-17 knockout animal studies as well as human experimental data indicate the crucial role of Th17 cells and its signature cytokine IL-17 in  the pathogenesis of these diseases. In vitro human studies have shown the abundance of Th17 cells in the psoriatic plaques.

The antimalarial drug and autophagy/lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CHQ) is considered as potential trigger of drug-induced or drug-aggravated psoriasis, in which Th17 cells sustain a persistent inflammation. In this study, we investigated the effect of CHQ on human monocyte-derived Langerhans-like cells (MoLC) and dendritic cells (MoDC) in response to IL-1β. The presence of CHQ reduced IL-12p70 release in both subsets,  but surprisingly increased IL-6 production in MoDC and IL-23 in MoLC. Importantly, CHQ-treated MoLC promoted IL-17A secretion by CD4(+) T cells and elevated RORC mRNA levels, whereas IFN-γ release was reduced. The dysregulation of IL-12 family cytokines in MoLC and MoDC occurred at the transcriptional level. Similar effects were obtained with other late autophagy inhibitors, whereas PI3K  inhibitor 3-methyladenine failed to increase IL-23 secretion. The modulated cytokine release was dependent on IL-1 cytokine activation and abrogated by a specific IL-1R antagonist. CHQ elevated expression of TNFR-associated factor 6, a common intermediate in IL-1R and TLR-dependent signaling. Accordingly, treatment  with Pam3CSK4 and CHQ enhanced IL-23 release in MoLC and MoDC. CHQ inhibited autophagic flux, confirmed by increased LC3-II and p62 expression, and activated  ERK, p38, and JNK MAPK, but only inhibition of p38 abrogated IL-23 release by MoLC. Thus, our findings indicate that CHQ modulates cytokine release in a p38-dependent manner, suggesting an essential role of Langerhans cells and dendritic cells in CHQ-provoked psoriasis, possibly by promoting Th17 immunity."

The Th17 immune pathway is increased in psoriatic patients, both in peripheral circulation and in skin lesions, and positively correlates with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) agents, in addition to potent inhibition of TNF-α activity, are able to decrease  IL-17 levels and Th17 cells in the skin and plasma of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. We found a decrease in the median Th17 cell count in peripheral blood after 4 months therapy with anti-TNF-α compared with baseline values, but the difference did not reach statistical significance, probably due to the small cohort size. Our data suggest that anti-TNF-α treatment for psoriasis is able to achieve a substantial Th17 cell count reduction in the peripheral blood of patients and that this decrease is significantly associated with an adequate response to biologic therapy, as previous studies in rheumatoid  arthritis have shown."

Interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 neutralization is an effective therapy for these lesions. As Th17 cytokines, such as IL-17A, and IL-1 family members, such as IL-36, play a significant role in plaque psoriasis, we analyzed the involvement of IL-17C and IL-36γ in anti-TNF-induced skin lesions of patients with Crohns disease. METHODS: IL-36γ and IL-17C levels in biopsies of anti-TNF-induced psoriasiform skin lesions of patients with Crohns disease were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis and correlated to additional immunohistochemical data. IL-36γ and IL-17C messenger RNA, protein, and induced gene expression in human primary keratinocytes were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: IL-36γ and IL-17C are increased in anti-TNF-induced psoriasiform skin lesions of patients with Crohns disease, compared with healthy controls. Epidermal IL-36γ and IL-17C levels strongly correlate with each other (r = 0.748, P = 0.003). In contrast to IL-12 and IL-23, IL-36γ increases the expression of proinflammatory signals and effector molecules of innate immunity in keratinocytes. However, IL-17C affects keratinocyte defensin gene expression only in combination with TNF-α. IL-36γ induces TNF-α expression in keratinocytes and sustains a self-amplifying proinflammatory loop with IL-17C by inducing its own expression and that of IL-17C. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a unique role of the previously unknown self-amplifying, proinflammatory IL-36γ/IL-17C loop in the pathogenesis of anti-TNF-induced psoriasiform skin lesions. These findings suggest a beneficial effect of IL-36γ/IL-17C inhibition during anti-TNF-induced psoriasiform lesions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease."

Like psoriasis, sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder  with Th1/Th17-driven inflammation. Therefore, we investigated the risk of sarcoidosis in patients with psoriasis compared to the background population in a nationwide cohort. METHODS: The study included the entire Danish population aged ≥10 years followed  from 1st January 1997 until diagnosis of sarcoidosis, death or 31st December 2011. Patients with a history of psoriasis and/or sarcoidosis at baseline were excluded. Information on comorbidity and concomitant medication was identified by individual-level linkage of administrative registers. Incidence rates of sarcoidosis were calculated and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity, medications and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: A total of 6,043,518 subjects were eligible for analysis. In the study period 70,125 patients with new-onset psoriasis, including 11,834 patients with severe psoriasis, were identified. The overall incidence rates of sarcoidosis were 1.18, 2.22, and 4.06 per 10,000 person-years for the reference population (9,717 cases), mild psoriasis (78 cases) and severe psoriasis (22 cases), respectively. Compared to the reference population, the age- and gender-adjusted  HRs for sarcoidosis were increased in patients with psoriasis with HR 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.87) and HR 2.51 (CI 1.64-3.85) for those with mild and severe disease, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this nationwide cohort, psoriasis was associated with a disease severity-dependent increased risk of sarcoidosis."

To investigate the circulating CD4(+) T-lymphocyte subpopulations in psoriasis patients before and after NB-UVB, thus providing new insights into the mechanism of NB-UVB in the treatment of psoriasis. We performed NB-UVB treatments for psoriasis patients (n = 30) and used flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and ELISA for the detection of circulating CD4(+) T-lymphocyte subpopulations. The results were compared with healthy controls (n = 20) as well. We found increased circulating T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell levels as well as decreased circulating regulatory T cells (Treg) levels compared to healthy controls. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of circulating Th17 cells and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. Furthermore, the percentage of circulating Th17  cells was negatively correlated with the Treg cells which led to an imbalance of  Th17/Treg. NB-UVB therapy significantly reduced circulating Th1and Th17 cell levels while increasing Treg cell levels. These findings indicate that the overexpression of Th1 and Th17 cells together with the imbalance of Th17/Treg cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The mechanism  of NB-UVB in the treatment of psoriasis may be through the inhibition of Th1 and  Th17 cell immune response as well as the promotion of Treg cell immune response,  thus ameliorating the disorder of circulating CD4(+) T-lymphocyte subsets."

Here, we crossed F759 mice with K5.Stat3C transgenic mice, in which keratinocytes express constitutive active Stat3 (Stat3C), leading to generation of psoriasis-like skin change. F759 mice harboring the K5.Stat3C transgene not only had aggravated skin lesions but also spontaneously developed arthritis with high penetrance in adjacent paws as early as 3 weeks of age. The joint lesions included swelling of the peripheral paws and nail deformities contiguous with the skin lesions, closely resembling PsA.

METHODS: Sixty patients with psoriasis vulgaris were divided into the BHS and BSS groups according to the syndrome differentiation of Chinese medicine (CM). Ten healthy subjects were considered as the control group. Cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-23 and IL-6 in serum were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and STAT6 in the psoriatic lesions were determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot, and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. RESULTS: Production of IL-17, IL-23 and IL-6 in the BHS group and BSS group were  significantly increased compared with those in the control group (P<0.05). Levels of IL-17 and IL-23 in the BHS group were higher than those in the BSS group (P<0.05).

Psoriatic keratinocytes are a major source of IL-1β; however, the mechanisms triggering IL-1β processing remain unknown. Recently, an acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) has been identified as a danger signal that triggers inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion. In this study, we detected increased SAA mRNA and protein expression in psoriatic epidermis. In cultured keratinocytes, SAA up-regulated the expression of pro-IL-1β and secretion of mature IL-1β. On the transcriptional level, blocking Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2), TLR-4 or nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) attenuated SAA-induced expression of IL-1β mRNA. SAA up-regulated caspase-1 and NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) expression in keratinocytes. Inhibiting caspase-1 activity and silencing  NLRP3 decreased IL-1β secretion, confirming NLRP3 as the SAA-responsive inflammasome on the post-transcriptional level. The mechanism of SAA-triggered NLRP3 activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion was found to involve the generation of reactive oxygen species. Finally, the expression of SAA by keratinocytes was up-regulated by IL-17A. Taken together, our results indicate that keratinocyte-derived SAA triggers a key inflammatory mediator, IL-1β, via NLRP3 inflammasome activation, providing new potential targets for the treatment  of this chronic skin disease."

It was observed that vitamin D had a beneficial influence on diseases connected with excessive activation of Th1 lymphocytes, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, non-specific enteritis, diabetes type 1 or psoriasis. The role of vitamin D in allergic diseases, in which increased activation of Th2-dependent reactions are of great importance, is controversial. However, due to a wide range of vitamin D activity, this view seems to be simplified.

For substantiation of findings, 3-dimensional epidermis models, isolated and in vitro generated Th-subpopulations, were applied. Parameters were analyzed via qPCR and IHC. RESULTS: CTCL lesions compared with psoriatic lesions presented an impaired upregulation of antibacterial proteins (ABPs), with levels even below those in atopic dermatitis. This was associated with a relative deficiency of the ABP-inducing cytokine IL-17 and a strong presence of the ABP-downregulating cytokine IL-13. The simultaneous presence of the Th17-cell cytokine IL-26 indicated that IL-17 deficiency in CTCL lesions results from functional deviation of Th17 cells. Accordingly, IL-17 but not IL-26 production by Th17 cells in vitro was inhibited by IL-4Rα ligand. Levels of other ABP inducers were comparable between CTCL and psoriasis lesions. The same was true about IL-22/TNF-α targets,  including the keratinocyte hyper-regeneration marker K16 and the matrix-degrading enzyme MMP1. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the cutaneous bacterial infections in CTCL are caused by impaired ABP induction as consequence of Th2-mediated biased Th17-cell function."

Aberrations of this balance may result in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. IL-22 is produced by Th17, Th22 and Th1 cells. Putative targets for IL-22 are cells in the skin, kidney, digestive and respiratory systems. The highest expression of IL-22  receptor is found in the skin. IL-22 plays an important role in the pathogenesis  of T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, we found that miR-197 is down regulated in psoriatic lesions. In the present work we show that miR-197 over expression inhibits keratinocytes proliferation induced by IL-22 and keratinocytes migration. In addition, we found that IL-22 activates miR-197 expression through the binding of phosphorylated STAT3 to sequences in the putative promoter of miR-197. Finally we found that IL-22 receptor subunit IL22RA1 is a direct target of miR-197. Hence, we identified a novel feedback loop controlling IL-22 signaling, in which IL-22 induces miR-197, which in turn, negatively regulates IL-22 receptor and attenuates the biological outcome of such signaling. Regulation of this pathway may be important in inflammatory skin disorders such a psoriasis and in wound healing."

It is assumed that the plaque phenotype of psoriasis is associated with T helper (Th) 1 immune response activation, while the guttate phenotype is associated with the Th17 immune response. Previous investigations of differences in the serum levels of cytokines relative to the clinical psoriatic phenotype have yielded conflicting results. This study compared the levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and LL-37 relative to the morphological phenotype in patients with psoriasis. Seventy-four  age-matched patients with psoriasis (32 with guttate psoriasis and 42 with plaque psoriasis) and 12 healthy controls were included. A multiplex cytokine assay and  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to measure levels of Th1- and Th17-derived cytokines and LL-37, respectively. Circulating levels of interferon- (IFN)-γ, interleukin- (IL)-1RA, IL-2, and IL-23, and LL-37 were significantly higher in patients with psoriasis than in healthy controls. However, the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-7, IL-22, and IL-23) and LL-37 did not differ significantly between the guttate and plaque phenotypes of psoriasis. There was a positive correlation between serum inflammatory cytokine levels and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score. The findings of this study suggest that the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines reflect the disease activity rather than determine the morphological phenotype."

CD4T cell population consists of helper T (Th) cell-subsets and immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells. Th1 cells produce IFN-γ and protect against intracellular pathogens.

Th17 cells secrete IL-17, recruit granulocytes  to fight against extracellular microorganisms, and play a role in psoriasis and AD. Th22 cells produce IL-22 that activates epithelial cells and mediates acanthosis in psoriasis and AD. On the other hand, Foxp3+ Treg cells attenuate immune responses partly via TGF-β or IL-10. Tissue resident memory T (Trm) cells  in the skin-most of which are epidermal CD8T cells-constitute the first line of the defense against repeated infections.

Aim of the study was to extensively evaluate the relative expression of 43 genes encoding for Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines in MSCs isolated from skin of psoriasis patients. MSCs resident into psoriatic skin were isolated, characterized and profiled by PCR array for the relative expression of genes encoding for cytokines involved in Th1, Th2 and Th17 pathways. MSCs isolated from the skin of healthy subjects were  used as control. The MSCs isolated from skin of psoriasis patients showed a greater relative expression of the most part of the analyzed genes encoding for Th1 and Th17 cytokines: INF-γ, CCR5, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL6, IL8, TNF-α, IL23A, CCL2, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL5, IL17C, IL17F, IL17RA, IL21, TLR2 than healthy subjects. On the contrary, the relative expression of genes encoding for Th2 cytokines: CCL1,  CCL22, CXCL12, IL2, IL3, IL4, IL13B, IL 22, IL 27, TGF-β1, was similar between the MSCs isolated from psoriasis and healthy subjects. In conclusion, the MSCs isolated from psoriasis show an imbalance between the Th1-Th17 and Th2 pathways,  which reflects the well-known abnormal balance observed in differentiated skin cells. This evidence could strengthen the hypothesis of an early involvement of resident MSCs in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

Immune cells infiltrate the skin and release proinflammatory cytokines that play important roles in psoriasis. The Th17 network, including IL-23 and IL-22, has recently emerged as a critical component in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-22 and IL-23 signaling is dependent on the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases, making JAK inhibition an appealing strategy for the treatment of psoriasis. In this study, we report the activity of SAR-20347, a small molecule inhibitor with specificity for JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) over other JAK family members. In cellular assays, SAR-20347 dose dependently (1 nM-10 μM) inhibited JAK1- and/or TYK2-dependent signaling from the IL-12/IL-23, IL-22, and IFN-α receptors. In vivo, TYK2 mutant  mice or treatment of wild-type mice with SAR-20347 significantly reduced IL-12-induced IFN-γ production and IL-22-dependent serum amyloid A to similar extents, indicating that, in these models, SAR-20347 is probably acting through inhibition of TYK2. In an imiquimod-induced psoriasis model, the administration of SAR-20347 led to a striking decrease in disease pathology, including reduced activation of keratinocytes and proinflammatory cytokine levels compared with both TYK2 mutant mice and wild-type controls. Taken together, these data indicate that targeting both JAK1- and TYK2-mediated cytokine signaling is more effective  than TYK2 inhibition alone in reducing psoriasis pathogenesis."

The present review will focus on the immunomodulatory properties of AS101, and specifically, its effects in mitigating autoimmune diseases. AS101 has several activities that act on the immune system,  including: 1) its ability to reduce IL-17 levels and to inhibit the function of Th17 cells; 2) its specific unique redox-modulating activities enabling the inhibition of specific leukocyte integrins such as α4β1 and α4β7, that are pivotal for diapedesis of macrophages and CD4(+) T inflammatory/auto-reactive cells into the autoimmune tissues; and 3) its ability to enhance the activity of  regulatory T cells (Treg).

However, the signalling mechanisms by which TGF-β1 mediates the development of psoriasis-like lesions remain unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that TGF-β1 mediates the development of psoriasis-like lesions via a Smad3-dependent mechanism. This was tested in a mouse model of K5.TGF-β(WT) transgenic mice by blocking TGF-β signalling with a specific Smad3 inhibitor. Topical treatment with a Smad3 inhibitor markedly blocked TGF-β/Smad3 signalling and progressive psoriasis-like lesions in K5.TGF-β(WT) transgenic mice, as evidenced by decreased skin severity scores, double skin fold thickness (DSFT) scores, infiltration of CD3(+) T cells and F4/80(+) macrophages and the degree of fibrosis in the dermis. This was associated with a marked reduction in TGF-β1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-23  and IL-17A both locally in skin plaque lesions and systemically in the plasma, resulting in inhibition of both the T helper (Th) 17 cell transcription factor RORγt and accumulation of CD4(+) IL-17A(+) cells within the skin plaque lesions.

Its efficacy raised questions regarding its possible mechanisms of action. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of combining Varilrix(®) and cyclosporine to cyclosporine alone in the treatment of severe psoriasis. Furthermore, to study the expression of T helper (Th)17 and T regulatory (Tregs)  cells before and after therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included 24 psoriatic patients, randomly divided into 2 groups (A and B). All patients received cyclosporine at a daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day. In addition, group A received 4 doses of Varilrix(®) once/3 weeks, and group B received 4 doses of subcutaneous saline. Skin biopsies were obtained from all patients before and after therapy and from all controls for estimation of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22 and Forkhead boxP3 (FoxP3) using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Group A patients showed a significantly higher % of clinical improvement (P = 0.011), which occurred earlier than group B. At baseline, levels of IL-17 and IL-22 were significantly higher while the level of FoxP3 was significantly lower in patients (P<0.001) compared to controls. After therapy, both groups showed significant reductions in both IL-17 and IL-22 levels, and significant elevation in FoxP3 (P<0.001). This change was significantly more evident in group A patients.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from patients and controls, and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) from patients. Cytokine production [elicited by phorbol myristate acetate  (PMA)/ionomycin] and surface phenotypes were evaluated by flow cytometry. CD146(+) CD4(+) and interleukin (IL)-17(+) CD4(+) T cell frequencies were increased in PBMC of PsA patients, compared with HD, and in SFMC compared with PBMC. CD146(+) CD4(+) T cells were enriched for secretion of IL-17 [alone or with IL-22 or interferon (IFN)-γ] and for some putative Th17-associated surface markers (CD161 and CCR6), but not others (CD26 and IL-23 receptor). CD4(+) T cells producing IL-22 or IFN-γ without IL-17 were also present in the CD146(+) subset, although their enrichment was less marked. Moreover, a majority of cells  secreting these cytokines lacked CD146. Thus, CD146 is not a sensitive or specific marker of Th17 cells, but rather correlates with heterogeneous cytokine  secretion by subsets of CD4(+) helper T cells."

All patients developed a clinically and histologically typical dermatitis upon nickel challenge even in close proximity to pre-existing psoriasis plaques. However, the ACD reaction was delayed as compared to non-psoriatic patients, with a maximum intensity after 7 days. Whole  genome expression analysis revealed alterations in numerous pathways related to metabolism and proliferation in non-involved skin of psoriasis patients as compared to non-psoriatic individuals, indicating that even in clinically non-involved skin of psoriasis patients molecular events opposing contact dermatitis may occur. Immunohistochemical comparison of ACD reactions as well as  in vitro secretion analysis of lesional T cells showed a higher Th17 and neutrophilic migration as well as epidermal proliferation in psoriasis, while ACD reactions were dominated by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and a Th2 signature. Based on  these findings, we hypothesized an ACD reaction directly on top of a pre-existing psoriasis plaque might influence the clinical course of psoriasis. We observed a  strong clinical inflammation with a mixed psoriasis and eczema phenotype in histology. Surprisingly, the initial psoriasis plaque was unaltered after self-limitation of the ACD reaction. We conclude that sensitized psoriasis patients develop a typical, but delayed ACD reaction which might be relevant for  patch test evaluation in clinical practice.

In the light of very successful anticytokine therapies for psoriasis, the focus has been directed towards the adaptive immune system. Expression studies, genetic studies and treatments specifically targeting players of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway, point at an important role for IL-17 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-17 stimulates the keratinocytes to produce psoriasis-associated molecules, eventually leading to chronic skin inflammation. The current opinion is that IL-17 is mainly produced by T cells, so-called T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, in psoriasis. However, evidence is accumulating that cells of the innate immune system, like neutrophils, mast cells, γδ T cells and innate lymphoid cells are the main source of IL-17 in psoriasis, rather than T cells. The paradigm in this field of research is shifting. With this viewpoint article, we will address this novel concept by critically summarizing the current literature on this subject. In psoriatic arthritis and atherosclerosis, important conditions related to psoriasis, it was  also found that the majority of IL-17 is associated with cells of the innate immune system. This new concept changes our view of IL-17. Blocking IL-17 with targeted treatments might be more far-reaching than previously thought; not only  IL-17 production by T cells but also by innate immune cells is blocked. Furthermore, therapies specifically targeting IL-17 may not only improve psoriasis, but also comorbidity that is associated with the IL-17 pathway, hereby preventing serious complications on the long term."

Nevertheless, they are very rare at inflammatory sites in comparison with other T cell subsets. Recently, this rarity has been explained by the finding that Th17 cells rapidly shift into the Th1 phenotype in the presence of IL-12 and/or TNF-α as well as by  the fact that they possess self-regulatory mechanisms limiting their own expansion. Th17 lymphocytes that have shifted towards a Th1 phenotype seem to be  particularly aggressive and more pathogenic than the Th17 unshifted cells. As a consequence, the Th17-derived Th1 cells, named non-classic Th1 cells, can become  a possible target for the therapy of some inflammatory disorders. In particular,  convincing evidence has recently been accumulated indicating that this subset can play a role in Crohns disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. More importantly, it has been shown that TNF-α inhibitors, which are used for the treatment of such diseases, appear to be able to inhibit the transition of Th17 lymphocytes to the non-classic Th1 phenotype, and thus they possibly help to dampen inflammation and arrest disease progression. Based on this context, the definition of the soluble factors involved in the shifting from Th17 towards non-classic Th1 subset as well as the comprehension of their respective pathogenic role in human inflammatory disorders would be of great help for developing novel therapeutic strategies."

ACT1 is an essential adaptor molecule in the IL-17  signaling pathway. A missense single nucleotide polymorphism (rs33980500; SNP-D10N) that resulted in the substitution of an asparagine for an aspartic acid at position 10 of ACT1 (ACT1-D10N) is associated with psoriasis susceptibility. Due to alternative splicing in humans, SNP-D10N encodes two mutated ACT1 proteins, ACT1-D10N and ACT1-D19N. Although both ACT1 isoforms are Hsp90 client proteins, the nine additional amino acids in ACT1-D19N provide an additional Hsp90 binding site that is absent in ACT1-D10N. Therefore, whereas ACT1-D10N is a dead protein that is unable to transduce IL-17 signals for gene expression, ACT1-D19N is fully responsive to IL-17. Intriguingly, the two ACT1 isoforms are differentially expressed in ACT1(D10N/D10N) fibroblasts and T cells. Fibroblasts  express both isoforms equally, enabling ACT1-D19N to compensate for the loss of ACT1-D10N function. ACT1(D10N/D10N) T cells, however, express predominantly ACT1-D10N. Lacking this compensatory mechanism, ACT1(D10N/D10N) T cells behave like ACT1-deficient T cells, exhibiting a dysregulated and hyperactive Th17 phenotype with overproduction of IL-22 and IL-17.

Genes in eczema related to epidermal barrier, reduced innate immunity, increased IL-6, and a TH2 signature. Within eczema subtypes, a mutually exclusive regulation of epidermal differentiation genes was observed. Furthermore, only contact eczema was driven by inflammasome activation, apoptosis, and cellular adhesion.

It frequently occurs in association with systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, myeloproliferative disorders and rheumatoid arthritis. Palmoplantar pustulosis is also an inflammatory dermatosis  characterized by recurrent sterile pustules localized on the palms and soles. These two dermatoses are histologically characterized by neutrophilic infiltration into the lesional skin. Co-occurrence of pyoderma gangrenosum and palmoplantar pustulosis in a single patient is extremely rare. We report a case of pyoderma gangrenosum occurred in a patient with palmoplantar pustulosis, with  a review of the previously reported cases. A 68-year-old Japanese woman with a 10-year history of palmoplantar pustulosis developed a skin ulcer on the left lower leg. The ulcer was diagnosed as pyoderma gangrenosum based on the clinical  and histological findings, and rapidly improved in response to oral prednisolone. In addition to our case, five cases with palmoplantar pustulosis who developed pyoderma gangrenosum have been reported. These cases were thought to have some characteristics in common, such as marked female predominance, no association with inflammatory bowel disease and myeloproliferative disorders, and good response to less aggressive therapy. The co-occurrence of pyoderma gangrenosum and palmoplantar pustulosis in our case may have an etiological link, rather than being a coincidental complication."

Interleukin (IL)-6 is a  pleiotropic cytokine that induces Th17 polarization via signaling through the membrane-bound transducer glycoprotein 130 (GP130). Previously, we demonstrated that n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) reduce CD4(+) T-cell activation and differentiation into pathogenic Th17 cells by 25-30%. Here we report that n-3 PUFAs alter the response of CD4(+) T cells to IL-6 in a lipid raft membrane-dependent manner. Naive splenic CD4(+) T cells from fat-1 transgenic mice exhibited 30% lower surface expression of the IL-6 receptor. This membrane-bound receptor is known to be shed during cellular activation, but the release of soluble IL-6 receptor after treatment with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 was  not changed in the CD4(+) T cells from fat-1 mice, suggesting that the decrease in surface expression was not due to ectodomain release. We observed a significant 20% decrease in the association of GP130 with lipid rafts in activated fat-1 CD4(+) T cells and a 35% reduction in GP130 homodimerization, an  obligate requirement for downstream signaling. The phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a downstream target of IL-6-dependent signaling, was also decreased by 30% in response to exogenous IL-6 in fat-1 CD4(+) T cells. Our results suggest that n-3 PUFAs suppress Th17 cell differentiation in part by reducing membrane raft-dependent responsiveness to IL-6, an essential polarizing cytokine."

SKLB4771, a potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor that we designed and synthesised, was used to treat cutaneous inflammation and psoriasis-like symptoms of disease in mice and almost completely cured the psoriasis-like disease without obvious toxicity. Mechanistic studies indicated that SKLB4771 treatment significantly decreased the number and activation of pDCs and mDCs in vitro and in vivo, and subsequent T-cell cascade reactions mediated by Th1/Th17 pathways.

However, only patients with AD suffer from bacterial superinfections with this pathogen, which implicates immunological differences in AD vs psoriasis in combating these bacteria. S. aureus recognition is partially mediated by intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptors (NLRs), which link α-toxin to caspase-1 activation through the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and to IL-1β secretion. OBJECTIVE: To investigate (i) NLRP3 expression in the context of different T-helper cytokine milieus and (ii) its function in response to sublytic α-toxin stimulation in patients with AD and psoriasis compared with healthy controls. METHODS: NLRP3 expression and function were investigated in lesional AD and psoriasis skin as well as in primary keratinocytes (HPKs) and monocytes upon stimulation with Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th22 cytokines or staphylococcal α-toxin, respectively, at the mRNA and protein (ELISA, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence) level. RESULTS: NLRP3 and caspase-1 expressions were reduced in lesional AD skin compared to psoriatic and healthy skin. IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 downregulated NLRP3  and ASC, whereas interferon-γ upregulated NLRP3 in HPKs. In monocytes, caspase-1  expression was reduced by Th2 cytokines and enhanced by a Th1 milieu. Caspase-1-dependent IL-1β secretion was impaired in monocytes from patients with  AD compared to patients with psoriasis and healthy controls by α-toxin stimulation following priming with lipoteichoic acid. CONCLUSION: Impaired NLRP3 expression and function may partially explain how skin colonization and infection with S. aureus can contribute to chronic skin inflammation in AD."

Understanding the autoimmune inflammatory pathways has led to the development of biological agents that target specific components of effector immune mechanisms. Despite the availability of many effective drugs, a large proportion of patients with moderate to severe IMID do not receive adequate treatment, and many therapies show decreased efficacy over time. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies. One subset of T helper cells, Th17, and the cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) play a central role in the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. IL-17 is involved in the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, haematopoietic growth factors, antimicrobial peptides, chemokines, and molecules involved in tissue remodelling; the inflammatory cascades triggered by Th17 cells and IL-17 itself, when unregulated, can result in widespread inflammation-related damage. Evidence of increased Th17 activity and high levels of IL-17 has been found in psoriasis, as  well as other inflammatory conditions, thereby signalling the potential utility of IL-17 as a therapeutic target. Clinical trials investigating IL-17 inhibitors, such as secukinumab, in patients with psoriatic disease have reported no significant safety concerns so far. It is hoped that these agents will improve the long-term prognosis of patients with these debilitating disorders."

However, there are no detailed investigations on immune competent cells infiltration. OBJECTIVE: Preferential infiltration of interleukin-17-producing T helper (Th17)  cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells into the labial salivary gland is reported to play a role in maintaining mucoepithelitis in patients with Sjögrens syndrome. In this study, we evaluated Th17 and Treg cell infiltration into the lesional skin of AESS. METHODS: We analyzed the numbers and infiltration patterns of Th17 and FoxP3 (+)  Treg cells in seven cases of AESS using immunohistochemistry. Seven patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis vulgaris (PV), which are representatives of Th17 cell-involved skin disorders, were enrolled as disease controls. RESULTS: Periappendageal and epidermal changes, such as follicular plugging and liquefaction, were evident in the annular erythema of SLE, not AESS, tissue samples. In AESS tissue samples, dense perivascular and periappendageal infiltration of lymph cells was observed in the middle-to-deep dermis, as previously described, in contrast to the superficial infiltration pattern observed in both AD and PV samples. While the total number of infiltrated lymphocytes was similar between AESS and SLE tissue samples, Th17 cells were found to be preferentially infiltrated in the middle-to-deep dermis in AESS samples. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that an increased number and distribution of infiltration of Th17 cells is a preferential feature of AESS, rather than a characteristic feature of annular erythema of SLE."

Conversely, activation of p38 with UV or osmotic shock mitigated TCR-mediated activation by phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of NFATc1. Notably, UVB treatment of human psoriatic lesions reduced skin-infiltrating p38 pY323(+) T cell IRF4 and IL-17 production.

However, the mechanisms of action by which FAEs improve psoriasis remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To identify pathways and mechanisms affected by FAE treatment and to  compare these with pathways affected by treatment with the antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF)-α biologic etanercept. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, 50 patients with plaque psoriasis were treated with FAEs for 20 weeks. Nine patients were randomly selected for gene expression profiling of plaque biopsies from week 0 and week 12. The groups consisted of FAE responders [> Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-75 improvement] and nonresponders (< PASI-50 improvement). Changes in gene expression profiles were analysed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and the  outcome was compared with gene expression affected by etanercept. RESULTS: Response to FAE treatment was associated with a ≥ 2-fold change (P < 0.05) in the expression of 458 genes. In FAE responders the role of interleukin-17A in the psoriasis pathway was most significantly activated. Glutathione and Nrf2 pathway molecules were specifically induced by FAE treatment and not by etanercept treatment, representing an FAE-specific effect in psoriatic skin. In addition, FAE treatment specifically induced the transcription factors PTTG1, NR3C1, GATA3 and NFκBIZ in responding patients. CONCLUSIONS: FAE treatment induces glutathione and Nrf2 pathway genes in lesional skin of patients with psoriasis. In responders, FAEs specifically regulate the transcription factors PTTG1, NR3C1, GATA3 and NFκBIZ, which are important in normal cutaneous development, and the T-helper (Th)2 and Th17 pathways, respectively."

Recent advances in the understanding of immunopathogenesis of  psoriasis led to an alteration in the treatment paradigm to the use of highly efficacious biologics. However, their high cost impedes the extensive use of these agents. Thus, inexpensive and safe medications are still considered valuable. In this study, we introduce the therapeutic efficacy of a newly formulated methotrexate (MTX), a chemical conjugate of MTX with cell permeable peptide, for the treatment of psoriasis. Topically applied skin-penetrating (SP)-MTX reduced the psoriasiform skin phenomenon, epidermal thickness and infiltrating immune cells into the dermis. IL-17A-producing dermal γδ T cells in  the cellular infiltrate that contribute IL-23/IL-17 axis were well abrogated by SP-MTX.

IL-17 and Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders, including psoriasis. IL-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is produced by Th17 cells along with other effector cytokines, such as IL-17F an IL-22, but it is also expressed by other cells of the innate immune system, including mast cells, neutrophils or dendritic cells, that are found in psoriatic lesions. For this reason IL-17 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target. Agents that inhibit IL-17 are in development and preliminary clinical results are promising, confirming the importance of IL-17 in psoriasis pathophysiology. Their selective intervention in the immune system makes them an attractive therapeutic approach to autoimmune diseases, particularly psoriasis, being possible that in the near future these novel therapies could be a valid alternative for currently available biologic agents."

This innate-like ability  of RORγt(+) nTh17 cells to respond to TLR4-induced cytokines was not shared by iTh17 cells. The other distinct properties of RORγt(+) nTh17 cells are their high expression of PLZF and their absence from lamina propria; iTh17 cells are found therein. RORγt(+) nTh17 cells are present in the thymus of germ-free RORγt-gfp and IL-6(-/-) RORΓ: t-gfp mice, indicating that these cells do not require symbiotic microbiota or IL-6 for their generation.

Recent evidence suggests that T-helper (Th)2 cells and their cytokine products orchestrate the pathology of asthma. In addition, Th17 cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of antigen-induced airway inflammation. The Th17 related cytokine interleukin (IL)-23 plays important roles in many immunological diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Several reports describe the role of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma in both human and mice. IL-23 leads to neutrophil infiltration in the airway of asthmatic mice, which is characteristic of severe asthma resulting  from Th17 development and subsequently IL-17 secretion. IL-23 can also promote eosinophil infiltration in the airway, which is a hallmark of allergic asthma. These studies suggest that IL-23 could be a promoting factor in the development of allergic asthma and likewise would be a target for asthma therapy. In support  of this view, trials of anti-IL-23 therapy have been attempted in human and mouse asthma models with encouraging outcomes. This review presents the role of IL-23 in asthma according to recent clinical trials and animal model studies. The proposed mechanisms of IL-23-induced airway inflammation and the agents currently being tested that target IL-23 related pathways are discussed."

Wild-type (WT) and fat-1 mice, which were treated daily with imiquimod (IMQ) cream or control cream on the shaved right ear and dorsal skin, were fed the same diet. The severity of inflammation of the ear and dorsal skin was scored according to the clinical Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and epidermal  hyperplasia was measured by H&E staining. The expression of inflammatory factors  in the epidermis was analyzed by immunohistochemical analysis. Flow cytometry and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to measure the differences in the  content of inflammatory factors in the blood serum and to determine which of CD4+ T cells were present in the spleen between IMQ-induced fat-1 mice and WT mice. Fat-1 IMQ-induced mice exhibited significantly lower levels of inflammatory cell-like T helper 17 cells (Th17 cells) and higher levels of regulatory T cells  (Treg cells) in the spleen as compared with the WT IMQ-induced mice. n-3 fatty acids stimulated Th17 cells to produce lower levels of inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22, IL-23 and stimulated Treg cells to produce  higher anti-inflammatory factors, such as Foxp3.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The examined group consisted of 11 patients with psoriasis  treated at the Department and Clinic of Dermatology in Olsztyn. Patients body mass and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated prior to the first administration of the ustekinumab dose and at week 28 of treatment (the day of the fourth dose). RESULTS: Body mass increase was determined in 7 patients (64%), on average by 2.27 kg (p < 0.05), and the BMI increased by 3.35% (p < 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Observing a correlation between ustekinumab application and body mass increase, similar to the treatment with anti-TNF-α preparations, an attempt  was undertaken at explaining that correlation by analysing the role of IL-12 and  IL-23 in psoriasis pathogenesis. IL-12 and IL-23, by influencing the naïve lymphocytes T and stimulating their diversification towards Th1 and Th17, also, indirectly, cause an increase in TNF-α and other cytokines production (IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-10, IL-22). Ustekinumab will then have a significant influence on decreasing the production of cytokines, which are important for metabolism and body mass."

OBJECTIVES: We sought to test a novel IL-23-specific therapeutic agent for the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study the safety, tolerability, and clinical response of guselkumab, an anti-IL-23-specific mAb, were evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. A total of 24 patients were randomized to receive a single dose of placebo or 10, 30, 100, or 300 mg of guselkumab. Clinical response was assessed by using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Additionally, histologic analysis and gene expression in skin biopsy specimens from guselkumab-treated patients were compared with those from placebo-treated patients. RESULTS: At week 12, 50% (10 mg), 60% (30 and 100 mg), and 100% (300 mg) of guselkumab-treated patients, respectively, achieved a 75% improvement in PASI scores from baseline compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. Improvements in PASI scores were generally maintained through week 24 in all guselkumab-treated patients. The proportion of patients experiencing an adverse event was comparable between the combined guselkumab (13/20 [65.0%]) and placebo  (2/4 [50.0%]) groups through week 24. Analysis of lesional and nonlesional skin biopsy specimens demonstrated decreases in epidermal thickness and T-cell and dendritic cell expression in guselkumab-treated patients compared with values seen in placebo-treated patients. At week 12, significant reductions in psoriasis gene expression and serum IL-17A levels were observed in guselkumab-treated patients. CONCLUSION: IL-23 inhibition with a single dose of guselkumab results in clinical responses in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, suggesting that neutralization of IL-23 alone is a promising therapy for psoriasis."

During the next 20 years, the role of the immune system and T-helper (Th) cells in psoriasis pathogenesis was recognized. The presence of the interleukin (IL)-12 cytokine in psoriatic lesions led to the postulate that psoriasis is mediated by  Th1 cells. Recent evidence has revealed a role for Th17 cells, and other immune cells, as proximal regulators of psoriatic skin inflammation. IL-17A, the principal effector cytokine of Th17 cells, stimulates keratinocytes to produce chemokines, cytokines, and other proinflammatory mediators thereby enabling IL-17A to bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems to sustain chronic inflammation. This model underlies the rationale for inhibiting IL-17A signaling  as a potential therapeutic approach to disrupt the psoriatic inflammatory loop. Several monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the IL-17 pathway are in clinical development. These agents exhibit promising clinical efficacy and tolerability profiles including immunohistochemical improvement in psoriatic plaques. Results  from clinical trials with IL-17 pathway inhibitors are refining our understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis and may provide a new therapeutic approach for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis."

Psoriasis vulgaris is an inflammatory skin disease mediated by Th1  and Th17 cytokines with relevant contributions of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17. Despite the pivotal role IL-17 plays in psoriasis, and in contrast to the other key mediators involved in the psoriasis cytokine cascade that are capable of inducing broad effects on keratinocytes, IL-17 was demonstrated to regulate the expression of a limited number of genes in monolayer keratinocytes cultured in vitro. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Given the clinical efficacy of anti-IL-17 agents  is associated with an impressive reduction in a large set of inflammatory genes,  we sought a full-thickness skin model that more closely resemble in vivo epidermal architecture. Using a reconstructed human epidermis (RHE), IL-17 was able to upregulate 419 gene probes and downregulate 216 gene probes. As possible  explanation for the increased gene induction in the RHE model is that C/CAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) -β, the transcription factor regulating  IL-17-responsive genes, is expressed preferentially in differentiated keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genes identified in IL-17-treated RHE are likely relevant to the IL-17 effects in psoriasis, since ixekizumab (anti-IL-17A agent)  strongly suppressed the RHE genes in psoriasis patients treated in vivo with this IL-17 antagonist."

Although its exact pathogenesis is  unknown, psoriatic arthritis is thought to share common mechanisms with psoriatic skin symptoms. Innate and adaptive immune responses are abnormally activated in psoriasis and may acquire the ability to attack peripheral joints and other sites following an environmental trigger (e.g. mechanical stress, trauma, infection) in genetically susceptible patients. The increased cardiovascular risk inherent in psoriasis appears further enhanced in psoriatic arthritis, likely reflecting the  overall burden of systemic inflammation contributing to atherogenic processes. Basic research and clinical trials have suggested that tumour necrosis factor is  important in psoriatic arthritis pathophysiology, and accumulating evidence suggests that Th17 cells and interleukin-17A may also be important. Basic research and clinical trials inform our understanding of psoriatic arthritis pathophysiology and, in turn, help dermatologists to make better treatment decisions."

This work was aimed to generate a collection of recombinant binders of human interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R), which is a key element of proinflammatory IL-23-mediated signaling. A library of  variants derived from the three-helix bundle scaffold of the albumin-binding domain (ABD) of streptococcal protein G and ribosome display were used to select  for high-affinity binders of recombinant extracellular IL-23R. A collection of 34 IL-23R-binding proteins (called REX binders), corresponding to 18 different sequence variants, was used to identify a group of ligands that inhibited binding of the recombinant p19 subunit of IL-23, or the biologically active human IL-23 cytokine, to the recombinant IL-23R or soluble IL-23R-IgG chimera. The strongest  competitors for IL-23R binding in ELISA were confirmed to recognize human IL-23R-IgG in surface plasmon resonance experiments, estimating the binding affinity in the sub- to nanomolar range. We further demonstrated that several REX variants bind to human leukemic cell lines K-562, THP-1 and Jurkat, and this binding correlated with IL-23R cell-surface expression. The REX125, REX009 and REX128 variants competed with the p19 protein for binding to THP-1 cells. Moreover, the presence of REX125, REX009 and REX115 variants significantly inhibited the IL-23-driven expansion of IL-17-producing primary human CD4(+) T-cells. Thus, we conclude that unique IL-23R antagonists derived from the ABD scaffold were generated that might be useful in designing novel anti-inflammatory biologicals."

RORγt is required for the differentiation of Th17 cells and expression of IL-17. In this article, we describe a novel, potent, and selective RORγt inverse agonist (TMP778), and its inactive diastereomer (TMP776). This chemistry, for the first time to our knowledge, provides a unique and powerful set of tools to probe RORγt-dependent functions. TMP778, but not TMP776, blocked human Th17 and Tc17 cell differentiation and also acutely modulated IL-17A production and inflammatory Th17-signature gene expression (Il17a, Il17f, Il22, Il26, Ccr6, and Il23) in mature human Th17 effector/memory T cells. In addition, TMP778, but not TMP776, inhibited IL-17A production in both human and mouse γδ T cells. IL-23-induced IL-17A production was also blocked by TMP778 treatment. In vivo targeting of RORγt in mice via TMP778 administration reduced imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like  cutaneous inflammation. Further, TMP778 selectively regulated Th17-signature gene expression in mononuclear cells isolated from both the blood and affected skin of psoriasis patients. In summary, to our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that RORγt inverse agonists: 1) inhibit Tc17 cell differentiation, as well as IL-17 production by γδ T cells and CD8(+) Tc17 cells; 2) block imiquimod-induced  cutaneous inflammation; 3) inhibit Th17 signature gene expression by cells isolated from psoriatic patient samples; and 4) block IL-23-induced IL-17A expression. Thus, RORγt is a tractable drug target for the treatment of cutaneous inflammatory disorders, which may afford additional therapeutic benefit over existing modalities that target only IL-17A."

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), infiltrating in psoriatic lesions, are known to exacerbate the Th17-mediated pathogenesis of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To address the initiative role of VEGF-A in the development of psoriasis and the pDC accumulation. METHODS: Numerical changes and VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2 expressions were investigated in skin-infiltrating T cells and pDCs of K14-VEGF-A transgenic  (Tg) and wild type (WT) mice. The chemotactic properties of VEGF-A for purified splenic pDCs were also evaluated by real-time chemotaxis assay. RESULTS: By flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, we observed that the number  of dermal IL-17A(+) γδ T cells, but not CD4(+) T cells, was increased in VEGF-A Tg mice, suggesting that the main source of IL-17A was γδ T cells. Moreover, we identified pDCs as 440c(+) cells by immunohistochemistry and as PDCA-1(+)B220(+)  cells by flow cytometry, and found that pDCs infiltrated at a higher frequency in VEGF-A Tg than WT mice. pDCs, but not γδ T cells, isolated from the skin expressed VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Freshly isolated splenic pDCs expressed both receptors after 48-h cultivation. pDCs did not produce cytokines in response to VEGF-A, however, they had a strong velocity of chemotaxis toward VEGF-A at a comparable level to chemerin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that VEGF-A functions as not only a downstream enhancer but also an upstream initiator by chemoattracting pDCs in psoriatic lesions."

Epub  2014 Jan 23.","Efficacy and safety of secukinumab in chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis therapy.","Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting about 1-3% of the general population. Moderate-to-severe psoriasis is commonly associated with various comorbidities, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and cardio-metabolic disorders such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. There  is increasing recognition that systemic inflammation accompanies severe skin disease. Abnormal innate and adaptive immune responses in the skin are involved in pathogenesis. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-17A is produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and T cytotoxic 17 cells. IL-17 plays a key role in host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. IL-17A acts on keratinocytes to increase expression of chemokines involved in recruiting myeloid dendritic cells, Th17 cells, and neutrophils to the lesion site. IL-17A also induces the production of antimicrobial peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines that, in turn, may amplify and sustain immune responses in the skin. Blocking IL-17A improved psoriasis-like pathology in experimental models, and reduction in IL-17 signaling is part of the mechanism of action of tumor necrosis factor-α blockers. Three agents neutralizing IL-17 (i.e., secukinumab and ixekizumab) or antagonizing its receptor (i.e., brodalumab) are currently being tested for efficacy and safety in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and PsA. Secukinumab is  a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes IL-17A whose efficacy in the therapy of chronic plaque psoriasis has been demonstrated in different phase II clinical trial. No new safety signals have emerged so far."

We isolated T cells from human blood and tissues and found that most memory TH9 cells were skin-tropic or skin-resident. Human TH9 cells coexpressed tumor necrosis factor-α and granzyme B and lacked coproduction of TH1/TH2/TH17 cytokines, and many were specific for Candida albicans. Interleukin-9 (IL-9) production was transient and preceded the up-regulation of other inflammatory cytokines. Blocking studies demonstrated that IL-9 was required for maximal production of interferon-γ, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-17  by skin-tropic T cells. IL-9-producing T cells were increased in the skin lesions of psoriasis, suggesting that these cells may contribute to human inflammatory skin disease. Our results indicate that human TH9 cells are a discrete T cell subset, many are tropic for the skin, and although they may function normally to  protect against extracellular pathogens, aberrant activation of these cells may contribute to inflammatory diseases of the skin."

To explore the effective role in psoriasis, we genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to IL23/Th17 pathway in 14,929 Han Chinese samples. A Bonferroni-corrected significant single-variant association was identified between rs1512970 within IL21 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.07, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.13, P = 4.94 × 10(-03)).

However, we found that their combined effect substantially contributed to the risk of psoriasis in our sample (P = 3.91 × 10(-07)) and the highest score group conferred the largest risk effect size (OR = 1.22, 95 % CI = 1.11-1.34, P = 1.85 × 10(-05)). Our results implicate the ethnic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of psoriasis and suggest common variants with weak effect in IL23/Th17 pathway, which do not show significance in conventional single-variant association study, may contribute to  the risk of psoriasis. This study sheds light on the important role of IL23/Th17  pathway in the susceptibility of psoriasis."

So far the order of changes in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is unclear. The responses to cutaneous leukotriene B4 (LTB4) application have been studied in the past as an in vivo model for inflammation. The aim of the present study is to find out the order of changes of key steps in inflammation, which all have been shown to be involved in mature psoriatic lesions. OBJECTIVE: To study the dynamics of the consecutive stages of inflammation in challenged skin as a reflection of a psoriasis-like inflammatory response. METHODS: We examined the dynamics of epidermal growth control and the key representatives of the innate and acquired immune system during the first 72 h after challenging the skin by LTB4 application. RESULTS: Interleukin 17-positive (IL-17+) cells dominate the acute phase of inflammation, whereas T-Bet+ cells seem to increase gradually during the entire observation period. This indicates a more important role for IL-17 in the unstable phase of inflammation and a more prominent role for T-Bet+ cells within  the chronic phase. CONCLUSION: The present model is highly reproducible and is useful in studying the dynamics of a psoriasis-like inflammation with respect to key components of immunity. It could provide a useful tool to study the immediate biological effects of new therapies like anti-IL-17 drugs on IL-17 production and effects on cutaneous inflammation and epidermal proliferation in vivo."

In a mouse model of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation, T-helper (Th)17 cells and  interleukin (IL)-17/IL-22-producing γδ-T cells have been shown to play a pivotal  role. However, the mechanisms of induction of the Th17 pathway and development of psoriasis-like skin inflammation by IMQ treatment remain unclear. In this study,  we investigated pathogenic mechanisms of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice. We first confirmed that, together with an increase in IL-17 and IL-22 production, application of IMQ to mouse skin induced the expression of  cytokines required for activation of the Th17 pathway, and pro-inflammatory mediators involved in the pathology of psoriasis. Analysis of Tlr7(-/-) mice demonstrated that most of the in vivo effects of IMQ were mediated via TLR7. In an in vitro study using plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs), IMQ induced production of interferon (IFN)-α, IL-23, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α.  Furthermore, when we analyzed in vitro-generated bone marrow-derived DCs with features similar to TNF-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-producing DCs, IL-23, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS/NO production was weakly induced by IMQ alone and further enhanced after co-stimulation with IMQ and IFN-α. These in vitro effects of IMQ were also mediated via TLR7 and the synergistic effect of IMQ, and IFN-α was suggested to be caused by upregulation of TLR7 expression by IFN-α. These results demonstrate part of the mechanism by which the Th17 pathway  and psoriasis-like skin inflammation are induced by IMQ and IFN-α in a mouse model."

Recent evidence suggests that abnormal activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7, 8 and 9 contributes to the initiation and maintenance of psoriasis. We have evaluated the effects of TLR antagonists on the gene expression profile in an IL-23-induced skin inflammation model in mice. Psoriasis-like skin lesions were induced in C57BL/6 mice by intradermal injection of IL-23 in the dorsum. Two TLR antagonists were compared: IMO-3100, an antagonist of TLRs 7 and 9, and IMO-8400, an antagonist of TLRs 7, 8 and 9, both  of which previously have been shown to reduce epidermal hyperplasia in this model. Skin gene expression profiles of IL-23-induced inflammation were compared  with or without TLR antagonist treatment. IL-23 injection resulted in alteration  of 5100 gene probes (fold change ≥ 2, FDR < 0.05) including IL-17 pathways that are up-regulated in psoriasis vulgaris. Targeting TLRs 7, 8 and 9 with IMO-8400 resulted in modulation of more than 2300 mRNAs while targeting TLRs 7 and 9 with  IMO-3100 resulted in modulation of more than 1900 mRNAs. Both agents strongly decreased IL-17A expression (>12-fold reduction), normalized IL-17 induced genes  such as beta-defensin and CXCL1, and normalized aberrant expression of keratin 16 (indicating epidermal hyperplasia). These results suggest that IL-23-driven inflammation in mouse skin may be dependent on signaling mediated by TLRs 7, 8, and 9 and that these receptors represent novel therapeutic targets in psoriasis vulgaris and other diseases with similar pathophysiology."

The reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) technique was employed to identify STAT3, STAT1, JAK1, JAK2, PKCδ and ERK1/2 phosphoprotein levels on total T cell lysates in SF samples of PsA patients. Frequencies of T CD4(+)IL-17A-F(+) and T CD4(+)IL-23R(+) Th17 cells were quantified in SF and matched PB of PsA patients by flow cytometry and compared with PB of healthy controls (HC). Increased levels of JAK1, STAT3, STAT1 and PKCδ phosphoproteins were found in SF T cells of PsA patients, compared with  PB of HC. The expansion of T CD4(+)IL-17A-F(+) cells, as well as of T CD4(+) cells expressing IL-23Rp19 (T CD4(+) IL-23R(+)), considered as the pathogenic phenotype of effector Th17 cells, was found to be confined to the joints of PsA patients, as the frequencies of both populations were significantly higher in SF  than in matched PB, or in PB of HC. In conclusion, T lymphocyte signal transduction pathway mapping revealed an enhanced activation of JAK1/STAT3/STAT1  and PKCδ phosphoproteins that may drive the local inflammatory process, characterized by the in vivo expansion of T CD4(+)IL-17A-F(+) and T CD4(+)IL-23R(+) Th17 Teff cells in SF of clinically active joints of PsA patients."

These treatments are similar in that they both decrease cutaneous immune system hyperactivity yet do so via different mechanisms. Our patient, a 63 year old Asian male had a rapid response to treatment with the high dose excimer  laser, having previously failed treatment with 28 weeks of ustekinumab therapy. A pre-treatment biopsy of a psoriatic plaque was found to contain relatively low levels of IFN-γ (Th1) and IL-17 (Th17) secreting T cells. Following treatment with the excimer laser, the patient had a quick improvement in PASI that was reflected by a 3-fold reduction in the number of live T cells found in the post-treatment biopsy. Although ustekinumab and the excimer laser both result in  decreased levels of these cytokines, the excimer laser directly causes apoptosis  of T cells and induces DNA damage in antigen presenting cells. Thus, the broader  effects of phototherapy on immune cells compared to the targeted inhibition of IL-12 and IL-23 by ustekinumab likely account for the superior response observed."

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the in vivo effects of PRL on the expression of Th17 cytokines/chemokines in imiquimod-induced psoriasiform skin inflammation in mice. METHODS: BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with PRL or phosphate-buffered saline, and imiquimod cream or Vaseline was applied to the shaved back skin for six consecutive days. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal PRL increased the mRNA levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22,  IL-23p19, IL-12p40, CCL20 and STAT3 in imiquimod-treated skin.

The first two Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, have been approved for the treatment of  RA and primary myelofibrosis, respectively. Efficacy and safety data suggest that some of these oral Jak inhibitors as well as their topical formulations may soon  enter the daily clinical practice for treating patients with psoriasis, lupus erythematosus or other inflammatory skin diseases. While biologics typically target one single cytokine, these new immunomodulators can inhibit signals from multiple cytokines intra-cellularly and therefore could be useful when other therapies are ineffective. Thus, Jak inhibitors may replace some traditional immunosuppressive agents and help patients not responding to previous therapies."

Pharmacological intervention to inhibit T cell-derived proinflammatory mediators  is an effective therapy in the treatment of psoriasis. Here, we present a model to study the interaction between keratinocytes and T cells in a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment, based on human skin equivalents populated with CD4+ T cells. T cell migration into the dermis initiated keratinocyte activation within  2 days, with hallmarks of a psoriasiform inflammation after 4 days. Expression of epidermal psoriasis marker genes was upregulated, and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were highly expressed. Disturbed epidermal differentiation was shown by downregulated filaggrin expression and involucrin expression in the spinous layer. These effects were mediated via soluble factors produced by the T  cells. The psoriasiform inflammation was also observed using T helper type 1 (Th1)- and Th17-polarized CD4+ T cells. We validated our model by treatment with  anti-inflammatory drugs that reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines  and chemokines and suppressed the psoriasiform inflammation. We propose that our  T cell-driven inflammatory skin equivalent model has potential to study the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases and may serve as a preclinical screening tool for anti-inflammatory drugs."

The majority of patients present with predominantly stable plaques. At the onset of new lesions, plaque-type psoriasis frequently demonstrates pin-sized and highly inflammatory papules sometimes with an inflammatory border. The histopathology of initial psoriasis differs from stable  plaque-type psoriasis. Early lesions demonstrate innate immune cells with neutrophils, degranulating mast cells and macrophages. These are followed by interleukin (IL)-1-dependent T helper (Th)17 cells, finally resulting in the Th1-dominated immunopathology of stable plaque-type psoriasis, where mononuclear  cells predominate with interspersed neutrophilic (Munro) microabscesses. These features suggest a bimodal immune pathway where alternate activation of either innate (autoinflammatory) or adaptive (autoimmune) immunity predominates. Neutrophilic infiltrations appear during early psoriasis with Munro abscesses. They are time limited and occur periodically, clinically best seen in linear nail pitting. These features strongly suggest a critical role for an IL-1-Th17-dominated autoinflammation in the initiation of psoriasis, followed by  a Th1-dominated late-phase reaction. The concept of bimodal immune activation helps to explain results from therapeutic interventions that are variable and previously only partly understood."

To study the influence of treatment on the expression of circulating immune cells contributing to the pathogenesis of psoriasis, six patients with psoriasis were treated with bathing in geothermal seawater two times daily combined with NB-UVB  five times/week for 2 weeks and six patients were treated with NB-UVB therapy three times/week for 8 weeks. Disease severity (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, PASI), chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, T cells and Toll-like receptors in the blood and skin samples were evaluated on enrolment (W0) and at 1 (W1), 3 (W3) and 8 (W8) weeks. Compared with healthy controls, psoriasis patients with active disease had significantly higher proportion of peripheral CLA+ T cells expressing CCR10 and CD103 and T cells with both Th1/Tc1 (CD4+/CD8+ IFN-γ+ or TNF-α+ cells) and Th17/Tc17 (CD4+CD45R0+IL-23R+, CD4+/CD8+ IL-17A+ or IL-22+ cells) phenotypes. Both treatments gave a significant clinical effect; however, bathing in geothermal seawater combined with NB-UVB therapy was more effective than NB-UVB therapy alone. This clinical improvement was reflected by a reduction in circulating CLA+ peripheral blood T cells and by a decreased Th1/Th17 and Tc1/Tc17 inflammatory response. These findings suggest that the inflammatory response in psoriasis is predominantly driven by both CD4+ and CD8+ skin-homing tissue retaining T cells of the Th17/Tc17 lineages."

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), an important systemic inflammatory disorder, has similar pathogenesis to psoriasis. Many of PsA patients do not respond to tumor necrosis  factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy, highlighting the need for additional treatment modalities with distinct mechanisms of action. Also, many patients stop responding to these agents after a certain period of use. A significant number of patients have a recurrent course or a persistent disease process. To meet these challenges a new agent working on different inflammatory aspect of PsA is needed. UST has been demonstrated to be effective, safe on short-term use and convenient  in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and PsA. Long-term safety is still a concern. Until recently, the exact role of UST in the management of PsA had not been very clear.

Although both patient groups show strongly impaired skin barrier function, only AD patients frequently suffer from cutaneous viral infections. The mechanisms underlying the distinct susceptibilities to these pathogenetic and often life-threatening infections are unknown. We show that antiviral proteins (AVPs) such as MX1, BST2, ISG15, and OAS2 were strongly elevated in psoriatic compared to AD lesions and healthy skin. Of 30 individually quantified cytokines  in psoriatic lesions, interleukin-29 (IL-29) was the only mediator whose expression correlated with the AVP levels. IL-29 was absent in AD lesions, and neutralization of IL-29 in psoriatic skin reduced AVP expression. Accordingly, IL-29 raised AVP levels in isolated keratinocytes, epidermis models, and human skin explants, but did not influence antibacterial protein production. AVP induction correlated with increased antiviral defense of IL-29-treated keratinocytes. Furthermore, IL-29 elevated the expression of signaling elements,  resulting in increased sensitivity of keratinocytes toward its own action. We identified T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells as IL-29 producers and demonstrated their ability to increase the antiviral competence of keratinocytes in an IL-29-dependent manner. Transforming growth factor-β and the activity of RORγt/RORα were most critical for the development of IL-29-producing T(H)17 cells. IL-29 secretion by these cells was dependent on NFAT and c-Jun N-terminal  kinase and was inhibited by IL-4. These data suggest that T(H)17 cell-derived IL-29, which is absent in AD, mediates the robust antiviral state on psoriatic skin, and demonstrate a new function of T(H)17 cells."

Adalimumab is a biological agent that inhibits TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine with a pivotal  role in the mechanisms of the disease. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the in vivo effects of adalimumab therapy on Th17 pathway. METHODS: Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to analyse levels of expression of Th17 polarizing cytokines (IL-23A, TGF-β, IL-1β, IL-6), Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-22) as well as TNF-α, Th1 polarizing cytokine (IFN-α) and Th17 downstream effector mediators, such as chemokines (IL-8, CCL-20) in skin and peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after 16 weeks of adalimumab therapy. Similarly, gene expression of Th17 induced mediators by keratinocytes (antimicrobial peptides: HBD-2, S100A7) was investigated at skin level. In addition, cutaneous and plasma IL-17 was examined  by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay respectively. Efficacy of the treatment was assessed by several clinical index scores as well as epidermal thickness reduction. RESULTS: Adalimumab therapy led to improvement in skin disease scores in all patients. Moreover, adalimumab treatment down-modulated Th17 pathway at skin level. Plasma IL-17 levels and IL-17-positive cells in psoriatic lesional skin were decreased by adalimumab treatment.

Because dermal blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic nerves, the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and the co-transmitter adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP) may regulate expression of EC inflammatory factors. We focused on IL-6 regulation because it has many inflammatory and immune functions, including participation in Th17 cell  differentiation. Strikingly, NE and ATP synergistically induced release of IL-6 by a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1). Adrenergic antagonist and agonist studies indicated that the effect of NE on induced IL-6 release is primarily mediated by β2-adrenergic receptors (ARs). By real-time PCR  IL-6 mRNA was also synergistically induced in HMEC-1 cells. This synergistic effect of NE and ATP was reproduced in primary human dermal endothelial cells (pHDMECs) and is also primarily mediated by β2-ARs. Under conditions of stress, activation of the symphathetic nervous system may lead to release of ATP and NE by sympathetic nerves surrounding dermal blood vessels with induction of IL-6 production by ECs. IL-6 may then participate in immune and inflammatory processes including generation of Th17 cells. Production of IL-6 in this manner might explain stress-induced exacerbation of psoriasis, and perhaps, other skin disorders involving Th17-type immunity."

Today, there is sufficient experimental evidence to classify psoriasis and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) amongst other inflammatory skin disorders as IL-17 associated diseases. In several human studies, T-cell-clones could be isolated from eczema biopsies, and high IL-17 levels were observed after challenge with allergen. In the last years, the phenotype of these IL-17 releasing T cells was in the focus of discussion. It has been suggested that Th17 could be identified by expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)C (humans) or RORγt (mice) and IL-17, accompanied by the absence of IFN-γ and IL-22. In cells from skin biopsies, contact allergens elevate IL-17A, IL-23, and RORC within the subset of Th cells.  The indications for a participation of Th17 in the development of ACD are supported by data from IL-17 deficient mice with reduced contact hypersensitivity (CHS) reactions that could be restored after transplantation of wild type CD4(+)  T cells. In addition to Th17 cells, subpopulations of CD8(+) T cells and regulatory T cells are further sources of IL-17 that play important roles in ACD  as well. Finally, the results from Th17 cell research allow today identification  of different skin diseases by a specific profile of signature cytokines from Th cells that can be used as a future diagnostic tool."

Patients with recalcitrant plaque psoriasis received apremilast 20 mg BID for 12 weeks. Responders (≥75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI-75]) continued treatment and non-responders (< PASI-75)  were titrated to apremilast 30 mg BID through week 24. Efficacy assessments included change in static Physicians Global Assessment, PASI, and body surface area, and proportion of patients achieving PASI-50, PASI-75, and PASI-90. Other assessments included adverse events, lesional skin biopsies to assess changes in  epidermal thickness, and immunohistochemistry to assess changes in peripheral blood subsets. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were enrolled. At week 12, 67% of patients had a  ≥1-point improvement in static Physicians Global Assessment, meeting treatment effect criterion. Mean percent decreases (improvements) from baseline were -59% for PASI score and -53% for body surface area. Most adverse events were mild. Median reduction in epidermal thickness was 34% at week 12 (P=0.083); five patients showed absence of keratin 16. Significant reductions in CD11c, CD3, and  CD56 indicate that apremilast reduced myeloid dendritic cell, T-cell, and NK-cell or NK-T-cell infiltration into the epidermis and dermis. Reduced inflammatory leukocytes, with a pattern of broad, partial inhibition, suggested reduced IL-23/Th17 and Th22 response pathways.

T cells from Dsg3H1 mice were polarized into Th17 cells in vitro and then adoptively transferred into Rag2⁻/⁻ mice. Dsg3H1-Th17 cells induced severe psoriasis-like skin inflammation within 2 wk after transfer in the tissues in which desmoglein 3 is expressed. Such pathology was not observed when  wild-type Th17 cells or Th1-skewed Dsg3H1 T cells were transferred, and it was strongly suppressed by anti-IL-12/23 and anti-IL-17 Abs. Although IFN-γ⁺/IL-17⁺ T cells accumulated in the skin lesions of mice that received Dsg3H1-Th17 cells, IFN-γ-deficient Dsg3H1-Th17 cells were fully pathogenic. These results demonstrate that cutaneous psoriasis-like immunopathology can be developed by epidermis-specific recognition of Th17 cells, which is strictly dependent on IL-17 but not IFN-γ."

Thus, several interleukins (ILs) have been identified and characterized in the past few years.  Here, we detail the structural and functional characteristics of IL-34 to IL-38 with special attention to their involvement in inflammatory joint disease. IL-34  chiefly increases osteoclast activation and proliferation and therefore, it plays a direct role in bone destruction as seen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) express IL-35, which therefore exerts anti-inflammatory effects by restoring Treg suppressive capabilities and by inhibiting the Th17 pathway. IL-37 has anti-inflammatory effects mediated by a negative feedback loop that decreases the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  IL-36 belongs to the IL-1 family and has three different forms. Although this cytokine has been chiefly studied in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, it also exerts pro-inflammatory effects in RA. The specific IL-36 antagonist, IL-36Ra binds to the IL-36 receptor, thereby, preventing signal transduction. Finally, IL-38 is a recently identified cytokine whose effect may resemble that of IL-36Ra as it binds to the IL-36 receptor and inhibits its effects, particularly the Th17-response. Although the exact roles for these cytokines awaits elucidation, the current improvements in our knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate chronic inflammatory conditions, such as RA may lead to the identification of new treatment targets."

Challenge of ABIN-1(fl) CD11c-Cre mice with topical TLR7 ligand leads to greater numbers of Th17 and TCRγδ T cells and exacerbated development of psoriaform lesions. These phenotypes are reversed by DC-specific deletion of the TLR adaptor MyD88. These studies link ABIN-1 with IL-23 and IL-17, and they provide cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ABIN-1 regulates susceptibility to psoriasis."

The role of the type 1 helper T (T(H)1) cell in sarcoidal granuloma formation has been well documented, and the T(H)17 pathway in sarcoidosis is just now being investigated. T(H)17 cells are also known to involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and the coexistence of sarcoidosis and psoriasis is mechanistically plausible based on potential shared underlying immunologic pathways. OBSERVATIONS: We report a case series of 7 patients with sarcoidosis and psoriasis vulgaris. All patients had psoriasis ranging from limited disease to involvement of 30% of their body surface area and had evidence of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Three of these patients also had cutaneous sarcoidosis, and 1 of these patients had evidence of both psoriasis and sarcoidosis in the same cutaneous specimen. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We report a case series of concomitant sarcoidosis and psoriasis, suggesting that common pathogenesis involving the T(H)1 and T(H)17 pathways may be responsible for this disease association. Although additional data are needed to clarify this association, this observation may lead to important understanding of the pathophysiologic and therapeutic management in these disorders."

The aim of this  retrospective case-control study was to analyse serum total IgE levels in generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a rare and severe variant of psoriasis. The levels of IgE in patients with GPP and patients with psoriasis vulgaris (PV) were compared with those of healthy controls. IgE levels were also compared with the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an indicator of systemic inflammation. The percentage of patients with GPP who had increased IgE levels was significantly higher than that of patients with PV and of healthy controls. The mean levels of  IgE were also higher in the GPP group. The IgE levels in patients with GPP had a  significant positive correlation with CRP levels. We hypothesize that serum IgE level is a general indicator for increased inflammation in GPP and PV."

Further comparison of the DLE transcriptome with that of psoriasis, a useful reference given our extensive knowledge of molecular pathways in this disease, provided a framework to identify potential therapeutic targets. Although a growing body of data support a role for IL-17 and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells in systemic lupus, we show a relative enrichment of IFN-γ-associated genes without that for IL-17-associated genes in DLE. Extraction of T cells from the skin of DLE patients identified a predominance of IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells and an absence of IL-17-producing Th17 cells, complementing the results from whole-skin transcriptomic analyses. These data therefore support investigations into treatments for DLE that target Th1 cells or the IFN-γ signaling pathway."

Studies have shown that it is expressed aberrantly in the suprabasal keratinocytes of psoriatic lesions, compared to in normal epidermis. K17 is also closely associated with the immune system and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In this review, we present our experimental findings concerning the role of K17 in psoriasis, and compare them to results published in the literature. Our results show that cytokines related to Th17 and  IL-22-producing (where Th17 is T helper cells, type 17 and IL is interleukin) CD4(+) T cells, including IL-17A and IL-22, upregulate the expression of K17 in keratinocytes. In addition, K17 stimulates autoreactive T cells and promotes the  production of psoriasis-associated cytokines. Our findings lend support to the hypothesis that a K17/T-cell/cytokine autoimmune loop is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We therefore review the current understanding of the K17 immunoregulation, including its expression and direct/indirect effects on immune responses. Pertinent strategies for the treatment of psoriasis are also discussed."

Current SpA treatments only provide partial symptomatic and functional relief in a subgroup of patients. Consequently, there is a need to better understand the pathophysiology of SpA to  develop more specific and effective treatments for these conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Genetic and mechanistic evidence links SpA with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis, and the symptoms of these diseases partially overlap. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and dendritic cells control the adaptive immune response, and failures in their functions are likely to contribute to the  establishment of chronic inflammation. The contributions of Tregs and dendritic cells to IBD and SpA have been assessed in both animal models of disease and patients. SUMMARY: Although defects in Tregs are important in psoriasis and in animal models of IBD, there is little evidence that they are important in SpA. However,  data from animal models indicate that dendritic cells drive pathogenic T-cell responses, partly through the production of interleukin-23 (IL-23). Dendritic cells from SpA patients may also contribute to disease by producing IL-23, therefore supporting the differentiation of the Th17 cells that contribute to inflammation. The driving forces in SpA pathophysiology are now becoming clear; these data may lead to the development of novel therapies to target SpA and related inflammatory disorders."

Here, we generated Sptlc2 (serine palmitoyltransferase long-chain base subunit 2)-targeted mice (SPT-cKO mice), thereby knocking out serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the critical enzyme for ceramide biosynthesis, in keratinocytes. SPT-cKO mice showed decreased ceramide levels in the epidermis, which impaired water-holding capacity and barrier function. From 2 weeks of age, they developed skin lesions with histological aberrations including hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, loss of the granular layer, and inflammatory cell infiltrates. Epidermal Langerhans cells showed persistent activation and enhanced migration to lymph nodes. Skin lesions showed upregulation of psoriasis-associated genes, such as IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, S100A8, S100A9, and β-defensins. In the skin lesions and draining lymph nodes, there were increased numbers of γδ T cells that produced IL-17 (γδ-17 cells), most of which also produced IL-22, as do Th17 cells. Furthermore, IL-23-producing CD11c(+) cells were observed in the lesions. In vivo treatment of SPT-cKO mice with an anti-IL-12/23p40 antibody ameliorated the skin lesions and reduced the numbers of γδ-17 cells. Therefore, we conclude that a ceramide deficiency in the  epidermis leads to psoriasis-like lesions in mice, probably mediated by IL-23-dependent IL-22-producing γδ-17 cells."

At present, the contribution of B  cells to the pathogenesis of psoriasis is unclear. In mice, topical application of imiquimod induces inflamed skin lesions and serves as an experimental animal model for human psoriasis. In this study, we showed that imiquimod-induced skin inflammation was more severe in CD19(-/-) than WT mice. These inflammatory responses were negatively regulated by a unique IL-10-producing CD1d(hi)CD5(+) regulatory B cell subset (B10 cells) that was absent in CD19(-/-) mice and represented only 1-2% of splenic B220(+) cells in WT mice. Splenic B10 cells entered the circulation and migrated to draining LNs during imiquimod-induced skin inflammation, thereby suppressing IFN-γ and IL-17 production. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of these B10 cells from WT mice reduced inflammation in CD19(-/-) mice. The present findings provide direct evidence that B10 cells regulate imiquimod-induced skin inflammation and offer insights into regulatory B cell-based therapies for the treatment of psoriasis."

Here we isolated, enumerated, functionally tested and clonotyped the CD4(+) Th cell population ex vivo from lesional biopsies and paired peripheral blood samples from psoriasis patients. Th17 cells were over-represented dramatically in lesions from all patients, representing 49-93% of CD4(+) Th cells compared with 3-18% in blood. Most lesional Th17 cells produced interleukin (IL)-17A ex vivo without further stimulation and expressed the CD45RO(+) phenotype characteristic of activated or memory cells. There was no increase in natural [CD25(hi) forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3(+))] regulatory T cells in lesions versus peripheral blood, but there was enrichment of induced IL-10(+) regulatory T cell numbers in biopsies from some patients. The lesional Th17 cells exhibited a bias in T cell receptor Vβ chain usage, suggestive of specific expansion by antigen. The therapeutic challenge is to overcome the dominance of overwhelming numbers of such antigen-specific Th17 cells in psoriatic lesions."

CCL20 correlated with disease severity. UVB therapy reduced skin symptoms, but did not affect the chemokine levels in plasma.

Interaction of activated T cells with monocytes/macrophages occurs via the Th17/IL-23 axis and is crucial for maintaining the chronic inflammation. Recent epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that psoriasis patients have an increased risk of developing and dying of cardiovascular disease. Similar pathology between psoriasis and cardiovascular disease, including involvement of key immunologic cell populations together with release of common inflammatory mediators such as IL-17A suggest a mechanistic link between the two diseases.

To gain insight into the function of Th17 cells, we performed transcriptional profiling in hopes of elucidating products not previously recognized as being functionally relevant in these T cells.

A CTS inhibitor, NC-2300, not only suppresses bone erosion by inhibition of cathepsin K (CTSK), but also ameliorates paw swelling at inflamed joints in adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. It has been demonstrated that the amelioration of joint inflammation by NC-2300 is mediated by the downregulation of cytokine expression in dendritic cells, which are essential for Th17 activation. In this work, we studied the role for CTSs in the pathogenesis of psoriasis-like lesion in K5.Stat3C mice, a mouse model of psoriasis, in which Th17 contributes to lesion development similar to psoriasis. Psoriatic lesions expressed increased levels of Ctsk and Ctss mRNA compared with uninvolved skin and normal control skin. Similarly, the epidermis and dermis in K5.Stat3C mice demonstrated increased CTSK activities, which were sensitive to NC-2300. Topical  treatment with NC-2300 significantly ameliorated 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced psoriasis-like lesions in K5.Stat3C  mice, and downregulated the expression of IL-12, IL-23, and Th17 cytokines. In vitro experiments revealed that TLR7 activation of bone marrow-derived myeloid dendritic cells led to increase in IL-23 at mRNA and protein levels, which were downregulated by NC-2300. These results suggest that CTSK plays a role in development of psoriatic lesions through TLR7-dependent Th17 polarization."

The human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, besides having microbicidal functions, plays multiple roles as a host defense peptide in the immune system. Here, we examined the effect of LL-37 on proinflammatory responses induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and cytokines in primary human keratinocytes. LL-37 inhibited dsRNA-induced production of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), CCL5/RANTES, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL8/IL-8, which was attributable to interaction  between LL-37 and dsRNA, although LL-37 upregulated CXCL8 expression at an earlier time point (8 h). LL-37 inhibited the increase of CXCL10 and CCL5 induced by TNF-α- and/or IFN-γ but enhanced that of CXCL8. LL-37 and Th17 cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22) synergistically upregulated the expression of CXCL8 and IL-6. LL-37 showed the effects above at a high concentration (25 μg/ml, 5.6 μM). We also examined effects of a peptide with a scrambled LL-37 sequence, which has been frequently used as a negative control, and those of another peptide with the reversed LL-37 sequence, activities of which have not been well investigated. Interestingly, the reversed LL-37 had effects similar to LL-37 but the scrambled  LL-37 did not.

Alarmins, such as ATP, likely play a pivotal role in the induction and maintenance of cutaneous immune responses by stimulating DC  maturation, chemotaxis, and secretion of IL-1β and IL-6, Th17-biasing cytokines.  In this study, using a well-established human skin model, we have demonstrated that signaling purinergic receptors, predominantly the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), via an ATP analog initiate innate proinflammatory inflammation, DC17 differentiation, and the subsequent induction of Th17-biased immunity. Moreover, our results suggest a potential role for P2X7R signaling in the initiation of psoriasis pathogenesis, a Th17-dependent autoimmune disease. In support of this, we observed the increased presence of P2X7R in nonlesional and lesional psoriatic skin compared with normal healthy tissues. Interestingly, there was also a P2X7R  variant that was highly expressed in lesional psoriatic skin compared with nonlesional psoriatic and normal healthy skin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that  psoriatic responses could be initiated via P2X7R signaling in nonlesional skin following treatment with a P2X7R agonist. Mechanistic studies revealed a P2X7R-dependent mir-21 angiogenesis pathway that leads to the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-6 and that may be involved in the development of psoriatic lesions.

DESIGN: Patients with IBD were prospectively screened for anti-TNF-induced psoriasiform skin lesions. Patients were genotyped for IL23R and IL12B variants.  Skin lesions were examined for infiltrating Th1 and Th17 cells. Patients with severe lesions were treated with the anti-interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 p40 antibody  ustekinumab. RESULTS: Among 434 anti-TNF-treated patients with IBD, 21 (4.8%) developed psoriasiform skin lesions. Multiple logistic regression revealed smoking (p=0.007; OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.55 to 13.60) and an increased body mass index (p=0.029; OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.24) as main predictors for these lesions. Nine patients with Crohns disease and with severe psoriasiform lesions and/or anti-TNF antibody-induced alopecia were successfully treated with the anti-p40-IL-12/IL-23 antibody ustekinumab (response rate 100%). Skin lesions were histologically characterised by infiltrates of IL-17A/IL-22-secreting T helper 17 (Th17) cells and interferon (IFN)-γ-secreting Th1 cells and IFN-α-expressing cells. IL-17A expression was significantly stronger in patients requiring ustekinumab than in patients responding to topical therapy (p=0.001). IL23R genotyping suggests disease-modifying effects of rs11209026 (p.Arg381Gln) and rs7530511 (p.Leu310Pro) in patients requiring ustekinumab. CONCLUSIONS: New onset psoriasiform skin lesions develop in nearly 5% of anti-TNF-treated patients with IBD. We identified smoking as a main risk factor for developing these lesions. Anti-TNF-induced psoriasiform skin lesions are characterised by Th17 and Th1 cell infiltrates. The number of IL-17A-expressing T cells correlates with the severity of skin lesions. Anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibody therapy is a highly effective therapy for these lesions."

Besides interleukin (IL-17)A, IL-22 represents a classical T helper (TH)17 cytokine and shares similar pathological effects in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis or arthritis. Whereas IL-17A supports protective immune responses during mycobacterial infections, the role of IL-22 after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is yet poorly characterized. Therefore, we here characterize the cell types producing IL-22 and the protective function of this cytokine during experimental  TB in mice. Like IL-17A, IL-22 is expressed early after infection with Mtb in an  IL-23-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the majority of IL-22-producing cells are not positive for IL-17A but have rather functional characteristics of interferon-gamma-producing TH1 cells. Although we found minor differences in the  number of naive and central memory T cells as well as in the frequency of TH1 and polyfunctional T cells in mice deficient for IL-22, the absence of IL-22 does not affect the outcome of Mtb infection. Our study revealed that although produced by TH1 cells, IL-22 is dispensable for protective immune responses during TB. Therefore, targeting of IL-22 in inflammatory disease may represent a therapeutic approach that does not incur the danger of reactivation TB."

Adoptively transferred CD18(hypo) PL/J Tregs were more inclined toward conversion into IL-17-producing Th17 cells in vivo in an inflammatory as well as noninflammatory environment compared with CD18(wt) PL/J Tregs. Addition of neutralizing Ab against CD18 to Treg-DC cocultures in vitro promoted conversion of CD18(wt) PL/J Tregs to Th17 cells in a dose-dependent manner similar to conversion rates of CD18(hypo) PL/J Tregs. Reduced thymic output of naturally occurring Tregs and peripheral conversion of Tregs into Th17 cells therefore both contribute to the loss of Tregs and the psoriasiform dermatitis observed in CD18(hypo) PL/J mice. Our data overall indicate that CD18 expression levels impact Treg development as well as Treg plasticity and that differentiation of Tregs into IL-17-producing Th17 cells is distinctly facilitated by a subtotal deficiency of CD18."

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells type-1 (TREM-1) signaling was a major canonical pathway in the published transcriptome of these cells. TREM-1 is a member of the  Ig superfamily, active through the DAP12 signaling pathway, with an unknown ligand. Activation through TREM-1 induces inflammatory cytokines, including IL-8, MCP/CCL2, and tumor necrosis factor. We now show that TREM-1 was expressed in the skin of healthy and psoriatic patients, and there was increased soluble TREM-1 in the circulation of psoriasis patients. In psoriasis lesions, TREM-1 was colocalized with DCs, as well as CD31(+) endothelial cells. TREM-1 expression was reduced with successful narrow band UVB (NB-UVB), etanercept, and anti-IL-17 treatments. An in vitro model of peptidoglycan-activated monocytes as inflammatory myeloid DCs was developed to study TREM-1 blockade, and treatment with a TREM-1 blocking chimera decreased allogeneic T-helper type 17 cell activation, as well as IL-17 production. Furthermore, TREM-1 blockade of ex vivo  psoriatic DCs in an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction also showed a decrease in IL-17. Together, these data suggest that the TREM-1 signaling pathway may be a previously unidentified therapeutic target to prevent the effects of inflammatory myeloid DCs in psoriasis."

In contrast, serum IL-23 levels were decreased in risk carriers when compared with non-carriers. We further demonstrate that IL-12 is increased in psoriatic skin and that risk carriers manifest a skewing of the inflammatory network toward stronger IFN-γ responses. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the risk variant in IL12B associates with its increased expression and predisposes to stronger Th1 polarization through deviation of the local inflammatory environment toward increased IL-12/IFN-γ at the expense of IL-23/IL-17 responses."

We have evaluated an antagonist of TLR7, 8, and 9 as a therapeutic agent in an IL-23-induced psoriasis model in mice. Psoriasis-like skin lesions were induced in C57BL/6 mice by intradermal injection of IL-23 in the ear or dorsum. IL-23-induced increase in ear thickness  was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with antagonist. Histological examination of ear and dorsal skin tissues demonstrated a reduction  in epidermal hyperplasia in mice treated with the antagonist. Treatment with antagonist also reduced the induction of Th1 and Th17 cytokines in skin and/or serum, as well as dermal expression of inflammasome components, NLRP3 and AIM2, and antimicrobial peptides. These results indicate that targeting TLR7, 8, and 9  may provide a way to neutralize multiple inflammatory pathways that are involved  in the development of psoriasis. The antagonist has the potential for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases."

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of photo(chemo)therapy on the Th17/Treg balance and Treg function. METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from psoriasis patients treated with bath-psoralen ultraviolet A (UVA, n = 50) or narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB, n = 18), and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 20). CD3(+)CD4(+)IL-17A(+) or CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+)cells were analyzed to estimate Th17 or Treg number by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Moreover, CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells from patients treated with PUVA(n = 14) were incubated in CFSE and activated with or without CD4(+) CD25(+)T cells, and the suppressive function of CD4(+) CD25(+)T cells were analyzed. RESULTS: Photo(chemo)therapy significantly reduced Th17 levels from 5.66 ± 3.15%  to 2.96 ± 2.89% in patients with increased Th17 (Th17/CD4>3.01% [mean+SD of controls]). In contrast, photo(chemo)therapy significantly increased Treg levels  from 2.77 ± 0.75 to 3.40 ± 1.88% in patients with less than 4.07% Treg level, defined as the mean of controls. Furthermore, while Treg suppressed the CD4(+)CD25(-) T cell proliferation to a greater extent in controls (Treg Functional Ratio 94.4 ± 4.28%) than in patients (70.3±25.1%), PUVA significantly  increased Treg Functional Ratio to 88.1 ± 6.47%. Th17 levels in severe patients (>30 PASI) were significantly higher as compared to controls. Th17 levels that were left after treatment in the patients not achieving PASI 50 (3.78 ± 4.18%) were significantly higher than those in the patients achieving PASI 75 (1.83±1.87%). Treg levels in patients achieving PASI 90 (4.89 ± 1.70%) were significantly higher than those in the patients not achieving PASI 90 (3.90 ± 1.66%). Treg levels prior to treatment with Th17 high decreased group (5.16 ± 2.20%) was significantly higher than that with Th17 high increased group (3.33 ±  1.39%). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that Treg is dysfunctional in psoriasis patients, and photochemotherapy restores those dysfunctional Treg. Photo(chemo)therapy resolved the Th17/Treg imbalance in patients with psoriasis."

We demonstrate that IL-17C (not IL-17A) is the most abundant IL-17 isoform in lesional psoriasis skin (1058 versus 8 pg/ml; p < 0.006) and localizes to keratinocytes (KCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and leukocytes. ECs stimulated with IL-17C produce increased TNF-α and KCs stimulated with IL-17C/TNF-α produce similar inflammatory gene response patterns as those elicited by IL-17A/TNF-α, including increases in IL-17C, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-1α/β, IL-1F5, IL-1F9, IL-6, IL-19, CCL20, S100A7/A8/A9, DEFB4, lipocalin 2, and peptidase inhibitor 3 (p < 0.05), indicating a positive proinflammatory feedback  loop between the epidermis and ECs. Psoriasis patients treated with etanercept rapidly decrease cutaneous IL-17C levels, suggesting IL-17C/TNF-α-mediated inflammatory signaling is critical for psoriasis pathogenesis. Mice genetically engineered to overexpress IL-17C in KCs develop well-demarcated areas of erythematous, flakey involved skin adjacent to areas of normal-appearing uninvolved skin despite increased IL-17C expression in both areas (p < 0.05). Uninvolved skin displays increased angiogenesis and elevated S100A8/A9 expression (p < 0.05) but no epidermal hyperplasia, whereas involved skin exhibits robust epidermal hyperplasia, increased angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltration, and upregulated TNF-α, IL-1α/β, IL-17A/F, IL-23p19, vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-6, and CCL20 (p < 0.05), suggesting that IL-17C, when coupled with other proinflammatory signals, initiates the development of psoriasiform dermatitis.

IL-9 also promoted angiogenesis and VEGF and CD31 overexpression in mice in vivo and increased tube formation of human endothelial cells in vitro. Injecting anti-IL-9 antibody into K5.hTGF-β1 transgenic mice not only diminished  inflammation (including skin infiltration by T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and  mast cells) and angiogenesis but also delayed the psoriasis-like skin phenotype.  Notably, injection of anti-psoriatic acting anti-IL-17 antibody reduced skin IL-9 mRNA and serum IL-9 protein levels in K5.hTGF-β1 transgenic mice and prevented IL-9-induced epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation of the skin of wild type mice. In addition, we observed that IL-9R expression in lesional skin from psoriasis patients was markedly higher than in healthy skin from control subjects. Moreover, IL-9 significantly enhanced IL-17A production by cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or CD4+ T cells, especially in psoriasis patients. Thus, IL-9 may play a role in the development of psoriatic lesions through Th17-associated inflammation and angiogenesis."

During ustekinumab treatment, some of our patients noticed reduced koebnerization of noninvolved skin and less new plaque formation. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether ustekinumab improves psoriasis-related gene expression and tape-strip responses in noninvolved skin. METHODS: Before and 4 weeks after ustekinumab treatment, noninvolved skin was tape-stripped. After 5 h, biopsies were taken from untouched and tape-stripped skin. The mRNA expression of psoriasis-related markers such as NGF, GATA3 and IL-22RA1, and several antimicrobial peptides (AMP) was quantified. Leucocyte counts and a broad range of inflammatory serum proteins were analysed to gain insight into the systemic alterations. RESULTS: Four weeks following a single ustekinumab injection, NGF showed a significant decrease, whereas GATA3 and IL-22RA1 expression increased, indicative of reduced responsiveness to epidermal triggering. This was accompanied by an increase of the inflammation-related serum proteins GPNMB, MST1 and TRADD. The baseline and tape-strip-induced mRNA expression of the AMP human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2), S100A7 and LL-37 remained unaltered. Clinically, after 4 weeks, eight out of 11 patients showed a 50% psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) improvement, which was accompanied by a significant reduction in serum hBD-2 levels. No changes were noted in total leucocytes, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that ustekinumab reduces psoriasis-related gene expression in noninvolved psoriatic skin, making it more resistant to exogenous triggering, without disturbing its antimicrobial response.

Th17 cells are known to produce the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A as well as other effector cytokines, including IL-17F and IL-22. Recent research has demonstrated that IL-17A is also expressed  by multiple lineages of the innate immune system, including mast cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, γδ-T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. It can thus be expected that the inhibition of IL-17A as a therapeutic target in  autoimmune disease would exert different physiological effects than the suppression of Th17 cell activity. Early clinical data are now available on secukinumab (AIN457), a recombinant, highly selective, fully human monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibody of the IgG1/κ isotype, enabling a preliminary assessment of  the effects of IL-17A inhibition in multiple autoimmune diseases.

Recently the long-term efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis has been evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical trials, and the results showed no significant risk for serious adverse effects, infections, or malignancies. Ustekinumab inhibits the function of the IL-12/23 p40 subunit, and therefore it is believed that inhibition of IL-12 p40 pathway decreases IFN-γ production. The major concern for the use of ustekinumab is the possibility of increased immunosuppression due to low IFN-γ production. However, the effects of  ustekinumab on CD4(+) T cell function have not been fully investigated so far. In this study, we explored changes in cytokine production by memory CD4(+) T cells as well as in the differentiation of naïve T cells to helper T cell (Th) 1, Th2,  or Th17 cells in psoriasis patients treated with ustekinumab. The effect of the treatment on T cell receptor repertoire diversity was also evaluated. The results showed that ustekinumab improves clinical manifestation in patients with psoriasis without affecting cytokine production in memory T cells, T cell maturation, or T cell receptor repertoire diversity.

Moreover, IL-17 and IL-22 treatment also induced IKKα in HaCaT cells and reconstituted human epidermis. IKKα induction was also noted, following the injection of IL-17 and IL-22 into mice ears. CONCLUSION: Although the induction of IKKα was accompanied by keratinocyte differentiation, IL-17 and IL-22 did not affect calcium-mediated differentiation  or the cell cycle. Rather, IL-17 and IL-22 appear to contribute to the inflammation occurring via the induction of IKKα from keratinocytes or skin layers."

In this study, activation of circulating psoriatic cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA)(+) memory T cells cultured together with epidermal cells occurred only when streptococcal throat extracts were added. This triggered the production of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cytokines, as well as epidermal cell mediators (CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11). Streptococcal extracts (SEs) did not induce any activation with either CLA(-) cells or memory T cells cultured together with epidermal cells from healthy subjects. Intradermal injection of activated culture supernatants into mouse skin induced epidermal hyperplasia. SEs also induced activation when we used epidermal cells from nonlesional skin of psoriatic patients with CLA(+) memory T cells. Significant correlations were found between SE induced upregulation of mRNA expression for ifn-γ, il-17, il-22, ip-10, and serum level of antistreptolysin O in psoriatic patients. This study demonstrates the direct involvement of streptococcal infection in pathological mechanisms of psoriasis, such as IL-17 production and epidermal cell activation."

We expressed activated H-RAS(V12G) in suprabasal keratinocytes of adult mice and  observed rapid development of a psoriasis-like skin phenotype characterized by basal keratinocyte hyperproliferation, acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, intraepidermal neutrophil microabscesses, and increased T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th17 and T cell type 1 (Tc1)/Tc17 skin infiltration. The majority of skin-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells coexpressed IFN-γ and IL-17A. When RAS was expressed on a Rag1-/- background, microabscess formation, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and keratinocyte hyperproliferation were suppressed. Depletion of CD8(+), but not CD4(+), T cells reduced cutaneous and systemic inflammation, the RAS-induced increase in cutaneous Th17 and IL-17(+) γδ T cells, and epidermal hyperproliferation to levels similar to a Rag1-/- background. Reconstitution of Rag1-/- inducible RAS mice with purified CD8(+) T cells restored microabscess formation and epidermal hyperproliferation. Neutralization of IFN-γ, but not of IL-17A, in CD8(+) T-cell-reconstituted Rag1-/- mice expressing RAS blocked CD8-mediated skin inflammation, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and keratinocyte hyperproliferation. These results show that CD8(+) T cells can orchestrate skin inflammation with psoriasis-like pathology in response to constitutive RAS activation in keratinocytes, and this is primarily mediated through IFN-γ."

Moreover, Th17 and Th22 subsets have been identified as Th1-Th2 modulators in inflammatory skin diseases, most notably psoriasis, but their roles in leprosy have not yet been elucidated. The occurrence of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (PEH) with transepidermal elimination of mycobacteria in LL patients, which could theoretically be a portal for contact transmission, thus raises important immunological questions: Do Th17  and/or Th22 subsets mediate epidermal proliferation akin to Th1-driven psoriasis  in supposedly Th2-predominant LL disease, and is the Th1-Th2 immunostat set systemically or locally? Furthermore, which microRNAs (miRs), signal transducers, and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins regulate this transition in leprosy, if any, and does differential Cb1-b expression play a role? OBSERVATION: A 71-year-old man presented with an infiltrative dermopathy characteristic of LL, as well as several hyperkeratotic plaques. Microscopic examination of the hyperkeratotic lesions demonstrated PEH with loss of the grenz zone and transepidermal elimination of acid-fast bacilli, whereas classic histopathologic features of LL were present at other sites. HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that: Th17 and Th22 T-cell subsets act locally to induce T-cell plasticity in LL lesions, manifesting PEH; miR-181a is normal or increased in LL lesions with PEH compared to its expressional loss in classic LL  lesions; miR-21 and STAT3 are increased in LL lesions with PEH, given their association with epithelial hyperproliferation; and Cbl-b is diminished in LL lesions with PEH compared to classic LL lesions. CONCLUSION: By understanding the factors that regulate T-cell and cytokine responses in leprosy, it should be possible to recognize these dynamic immunologic processes clinically and histopathologically and devise specific immunologic interventions."

The IL-23/Th17 pathway is a therapeutic target for biologic agents and systemic therapies in psoriasis treatment. A literature search was performed to review and summarize the current evidence on IL-17 and IL-23 as a basis for understanding the use of anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-23 agents for psoriasis therapy. Using PubMed, recent articles were identified pertaining to IL-17, IL-23, and psoriasis. Signaling via the heterodimeric IL-23 receptor induces production of IL-17, which stimulates production of proinflammatory keratinocyte cytokines that mediate the psoriatic response. An overexpression of  IL-23, IL-17, or Th17 cells in transgenic mice is associated with the development of inflammatory disease. Both IL-17 knockout mice and humans with a genetic IL-17 deficiency are susceptible to extracellular and intracellular pathogens. This suggests a potential for adverse effects from clinical administration of anti IL-23-p40/IL-17 therapies. Anti-p40 antibodies, briakinumab and ustekinumab, were tolerated in clinical trials and substantially improved psoriasis. Further trials of anti IL-17 therapies are needed to assess their clinical use and potential for infection and other adverse events."

Interleukin (IL)-17A is believed to be an important effector cytokine in the pathogenesis of  psoriasis and is produced by Th17 cells, a class of helper T cells that act outside the established Th1/Th2 paradigm for regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab,  a fully human anti-IL-17A IgG1κ monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: Patients (n = 125) were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to receive subcutaneous doses of placebo (n = 22) or secukinumab [1 × 25 mg (n = 29), 3 × 25 mg (n = 26), 3 × 75 mg (n = 21) or 3 × 150 mg (n = 27)] at weeks 0, 4 and 8. After the 12-week treatment period, patients entered a follow-up period of 24 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was at least 75% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75); secondary outcomes included the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) and PASI 90 and 50 response rates. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, secukinumab 3 × 150 mg and 3 × 75 mg resulted in significantly higher PASI 75 response rates vs. placebo (82% and 57%  vs. 9%; P < 0·001 and P = 0·002, respectively). Higher PASI 75 response rates compared with placebo were maintained throughout the follow-up period with these  dosages [week 36, 26% (n = 7) and 19% (n = 4) vs. 4% (n = 1), respectively], with a gradual decline of PASI 75 response over time after the dosing period. IGA response rates were significantly higher in the 3 × 150 mg group vs. placebo at week 12 (48% vs. 9%; P = 0·005) and were consistently higher for the 3 × 150 mg and 3 × 75 mg groups vs. placebo at all time points from week 4 onward. The PASI  90 response rate was significantly higher in the 3 × 150 mg group vs. placebo (52% vs. 5%) at week 12 and remained higher during the follow-up period. Secukinumab was well tolerated. Two cases of neutropenia (≤ grade 2) were reported in the 3 × 150 mg cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with subcutaneous secukinumab 3 × 75 mg and 3 × 150 mg met the primary outcome of PASI 75 response achievement after 12 weeks, demonstrating efficacy in moderate-to-severe psoriasis."

It  has been reported that some adipokines and Th17-related cytokines are altered in  patients with psoriasis. AIM: To examine the relationship between levels of adipokines and Th17-related cytokines in the serum of patients with psoriasis compared with healthy controls. METHODS: We enrolled 30 patients with psoriasis and 30 normal controls in the study, and used ELISA to measure serum adipokines and Th17-related cytokines. The association between each adipokine and each cytokine was determined using Pearson correlation analysis. Multiple regression analysis using all adipokines and Th17-related cytokines as covariates was also performed. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis showed a strong positive association between chemerin and resistin levels and between adiponectin and high molecular weight adiponectin in normal controls. By contrast, in patients with psoriasis, resistin levels were significantly positively associated with tumour necrosis factor-α, while there was a strong negative association between retinol binding protein-4 and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. Interestingly, a marked positive correlation between IL-22 and adiponectin was also found in patients with psoriasis. Leptin levels correlated positively with IL-6 in patients with psoriasis, but this did not reach significance. The correlations identified by the multiple regression analyses were almost identical to those from the Pearson  analyses. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that distinct interaction between adipokines and  Th17 cytokines is involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

In this study, to further investigate the in vivo role of IL-27 in the pathogenesis  of psoriasis, we induced psoriasis-like inflammation on mouse back skin with topical application of imiquimod (IMQ), and continuously injected IL-27 or PBS subcutaneously. IMQ-treated skin showed an increase of IL-27 mRNA levels and the  infiltration of IL-27-producing cells in the papillary dermis. The injection of IL-27 to the IMQ-treated skin exacerbated the disease compared with PBS injection. The IL-27 injection further augmented mRNA levels of IFN-γ, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and TNF-α, without altering those of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, and CCL20. Finally, IL-27 antagonism attenuated the upregulation of IFN-γ, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and TNF-α mRNA levels, and induced clinical and histological improvement in the IMQ-treated skin.

Recently, it was postulated that IL-17 has an important role both in psoriasis and in the IMQ model. To further investigate the impact of IL-17RA signaling in psoriasis, we generated IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA)-deficient mice (IL-17RA(del)) and challenged these mice with IMQ. Interestingly, the disease was only partially reduced and delayed but not abolished when compared with controls. In the absence of IL-17RA, we found persisting signs of inflammation such as neutrophil and macrophage infiltration within the skin. Surprisingly, already in the naive state, the skin of IL-17RA(del) mice contained significantly elevated numbers of Th17- and IL-17-producing γδ T cells, assuming that IL-17RA signaling regulates the population size of Th17 and γδ T cells. Upon IMQ treatment of IL-17RA(del) mice,  these cells secreted elevated amounts of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-22, accompanied by increased levels of the chemokine CXCL2, suggesting an alternative pathway of neutrophil and macrophage skin infiltration.

While CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are important sources of this cytokine, recent evidence has suggested that  γδ T cells and a number of families of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) can secrete IL-17 and related cytokines. The production of IL-17 by γδ T cells appears to be  largely independent of T-cell receptor activation and is promoted through cytokine signalling, in particular by IL-23 in combination with IL-1β or IL-18. Therefore IL-17-secreting γδ T cells can be categorised as a family of cells similar to innate-like lymphoid cells. IL-17-secreting γδ T cells function as a part of mucosal defence against infection, with most studies to date focusing on  their response to bacterial pathogens. γδ T cells also play a pathological role in certain autoimmune diseases, where they provide an early source of IL-17 and IL-21, which initiate responses mediated by conventional IL-17-secreting CD4(+) T cells (Th17 cells). ILCs lack an antigen receptor or other lineage markers, and ILC subsets that express the transcriptional factor RORγt have been found to secrete IL-17.

Herein, CCL20 was highly upregulated in IL-23-injected WT mouse ear skin as early as 24 hours after initial treatment, and large numbers of CCR6(+) cells were observed in the epidermis of IL-23-injected WT mice. Anti-CCL20 mAbs reduced psoriasiform dermatitis and blocked recruitment of GDL T cells to the epidermis. In CCR6 KO mice, GDL T cells failed to accumulate in the epidermis after IL-23 treatment, but the total numbers of GDL T cells in the dermis of WT and CCR6 KO mice were equivalent. There was an ∼70% reduction in the proportion of IL-22(+) GDL T cells in the dermis of CCR6 KO mice (vs WT mice), suggesting that effector function and epidermal recruitment of GDL T cells are impaired in CCR6-deficient mice.

Little is known about the type of dendritic cells  supporting this immune response. We recently demonstrated the strong Th1- and Th17-T-cell inducing capacity of human 6-sulfo LacNAc-dendritic cells (slanDCs),  and identified slanDCs as inflammatory dermal dendritic cells in psoriasis locally expressing IL-23, TNF-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In this study, we investigated the role of slanDCs in LE. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified slanDCs at increased frequency in affected skin lesions of cutaneous and systemic LE. slanDCs were found scattered in the dermal compartment and also clustered in lymph follicle-like structures. Here, they colocalized with T cells in the periphery but not with B cells in the center. The positive staining of dermal slanDCs for TNF-α indicated their pro-inflammatory status. In vitro the production of TNF-α was induced when slanDCs were cultured in the presence of serum from patients with LE. Stimulatory components of LE serum were previously identified as autoimmune complexes with ssRNA binding to TLR7 and TLR8. We found that slanDCs express mRNA for TLR7 and TLR8. slanDCs stimulated with ssRNA, selective TLR7 or TLR8 ligands responded with high-level TNF-α and IL-12 production. In contrast to slanDCs, the population of CD1c(+) DCs and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) expressed either TLR7 or TLR8, and their production of TNF-α and IL-12 to respective ligands was far less  pronounced. We conclude that slanDCs have molecular and functional features of a  pro-inflammatory myeloid DC type relevant for the immunopathogenesis of LE."

Besides, APECED is characterized by high-titer antibodies against a wide variety of cytokines that could partly be responsible for the clinical symptoms during APECED, mainly chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and linked to antibodies against Th17 cells effector molecules, IL-17 and IL-22. On the other hand, the same antibodies, together with antibodies against type I interferons may prevent the patients from other immunological diseases, such as psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematous. The same effector Th17 cells, present in the lymphocytic infiltrate of target organs of APECED, could be responsible for the tissue destruction. Here again, the antibodies against the corresponding effector molecules, anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-22 could be  protective. The occurrence of several effector mechanisms (CD4(+) Th17 cell and CD8(+) CTL and the effector cytokines IL-17 and IL-22), and simultaneous existence of regulatory mechanisms (CD4(+) Treg and antibodies neutralizing the effect of the effector cytokines) may explain the polymorphism of APECED. Almost  all the patients develop the characteristic manifestations of the complex, but temporal course and severity of the symptoms vary considerably, even among siblings. The autoantibody profile does not correlate with the clinical picture.  One could speculate that a secondary homeostatic balance between the harmful effector mechanisms, and the favorable regulatory mechanisms, finally define both the extent and severity of the clinical condition in the AIRE defective individuals. The proposed hypothesis that in APECED, in addition to strong tissue destructive mechanisms, a controlling regulatory mechanism does exist, allow us to conclude that APECED could be treated, and even cured, with immunological manipulation."

This review focuses mainly on reports that have addressed the mechanism of K17 up-regulation and its biological role in psoriasis. In addition  to IFN-γ, IL-17A and IL-22, which are derived from Th17 and Th22 cells, could up-regulate K17 mRNA and protein levels in keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, these effects are partially blocked with STAT1- and STAT3-specific inhibitors, as well as small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting STAT1 and STAT3. On the other hand, the HLA DRB1*04 and/or *07 positive patients  show significant T cell responses to two peptides from K17 protein selected on the basis of predicted HLA DRB1*04 and/or *07 bindings. One peptide contains the  ALEEAN sequence, while the other peptide has an amino acid sequence that has not  been previously reported. Analysis of these processes led us to propose the existence of a K17/T cells/cytokine autoimmune loop, in which ectopically expressed K17 impacts on the maintenance of psoriasis by activating autoreactive  T cells. Furthermore, it has been found that altered peptide ligands, which are produced through single alanine residue substitutions at a critical TCR contact position, abolish the T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production induced by K17 pathogenic peptides. K17-specific antisense ODNs and RNAi suppress K17 mRNA and protein expression in psoriatic skin in vivo, which coincides with marked clinical and histological improvement. These findings highlight K17 as an attractive target for novel therapies aimed at curtailing psoriasis driven by chronic inflammation."

It is produced by immune cell subsets, including CD4⁺ T cells, natural killer cells, and natural killer T cells. In the skin, IL-22 mediates keratinocyte proliferation and epidermal hyperplasia, inhibits terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, and induces the production of antimicrobial proteins. Although IL-22 production was initially linked with IL-17 expression in Th17 cells, IL-22  production can also occur in an apparently unique subset of cells that lacks the  production of IL-17 and IFN-γ (Th22). Interestingly, Th22 cells express skin homing chemokine receptors CCR4 and CCR10. Indeed, Th22 cells reside in the normal skin and are shown to be enriched in the lesional skin of inflammatory skin diseases, indicating the importance of IL-22 in skin homeostasis and pathogenesis of skin diseases. Although psoriasis is the first example of an organ-specific immune disorder for which the role of IL-22 has been comprehensively studied, a growing body of evidence indicates that this cytokine  also plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. In this review, we discuss the role of IL-22 in the pathogenesis of skin diseases, particularly focusing on psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

The cytokine interleukin (IL)-17A plays a key role in host defence against extracellular bacteria and fungi. An increasing body of evidence suggests that IL-17A is also important in psoriasis pathogenesis. While IL-17A is a key product of Th17 cells, it is also produced by neutrophils, mast cells and Tc17 cells. Each of these cell types is found in psoriatic lesions. IL-17A acts on keratinocytes to increase expression of chemokines (e.g. CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6 and CXCL8) involved in recruiting myeloid dendritic cells, Th17 cells and neutrophils to the lesion site. IL-17A induces production of antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines that, in turn, may help sustain immune responses in the skin. Blocking IL-17A improved psoriasis-like pathology in experimental models, and reductions in IL-17 signalling have been associated with response to tumour necrosis factor-α blockers in patients with psoriasis. Agents that inhibit IL-17  are in development and preliminary clinical results for IL-17 inhibitors indicate the importance of IL-17A in psoriasis pathophysiology. In a proof-of-concept and  two phase II trials, three agents markedly reduced disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. One agent downregulated cytokines, chemokines and proteins associated with inflammatory responses in lesional skin.  In summary, IL-17A is an attractive therapeutic target, which may allow selective intervention to address the dysregulated immune system in plaque psoriasis."

At the baseline and at the end of the treatment, blood and skin samples were taken to investigate IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells. As controls, 10 healthy controls (HC) and 6 atopic dermatitis (AD) patients were included into the study. RESULTS: Psoriasis patients showed augmented IL-17- and IL-8-producing CD4(+) cells in the blood than HC and AD patients. In the skin lesions, IL-17(+) cells were more represented in psoriasis than in AD, while the number of IL-4-producing cells was reduced in psoriasis patients than in AD ones.

By week 6, the skin appeared normal. Quantitative RT-PCR and microarrays revealed an ablation of the disease-defining mRNA expression profile by 2 weeks after the first dose of study drug. The effect of IL-17 blockade on expression of genes synergistically regulated by IL-17 and TNF-α was of higher magnitude at 2 weeks than in prior studies with TNF-α antagonism.

Recently, IL-17 cytokines have been strongly implicated as critical for the pathogenesis of this disease. IL-17A (also known as IL-17) and IL-17F are the signature cytokines of Th17 cells, but are also produced by innate cells, including γδ T cells present in skin, whereas epithelial cells, including keratinocytes, may produce IL-17C. IL-17 cytokines signal via the adaptor protein connection to IκB kinase and stress-activated protein kinases (CIKS)/Act1. Psoriasis is a disease with a strong genetic predisposition, and the gene encoding CIKS has recently been identified as a susceptibility locus. Unexpectedly, one predisposing gene variant features a mutation that impairs rather than enhances CIKS-mediated IL-17 cytokine signaling, counter to the predicted role for IL-17 cytokines in psoriatic inflammation. In this study, we demonstrate, however, that this mutant adaptor does not impair the IL-17-specific contributions to the genetic response when combined with TNF-α, a cytokine also prominent in psoriatic inflammation. Interestingly, TNF-α signals compensate IL-17 signaling defects imposed by this mutant adaptor even for genes that are not induced by TNF-α alone, including the transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ and IκBζ, which help regulate secondary gene expression in response to IL-17. Based on these findings we discuss a scenario in which the mutant adaptor may interfere with homeostatic maintenance of epithelial barriers, thereby potentially enabling the initiation of inflammatory responses to insults, whereas this same mutant adaptor would still be able to mediate IL-17-specific contributions to inflammation once TNF-α is present."

Epub 2012 Apr 1.","The Th17/IL-23 Axis and Natural Immunity in Psoriatic Arthritis.","Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that causes enthesitis and destructive arthritis and significantly lowers patient quality of  life. Recognition of the two target organs (the skin and joints) involved in the  immunopathophysiology of PsA helped in elucidating the pathology of various systemic autoimmune diseases targeting multiple organs. Recent advances in immunology and genetics have made it clear that acquired immunity, especially that mediated by the Th17/IL-23 axis, plays an important role in the inflammatory pathology observed in psoriasis and PsA. Additionally, involvement of natural immunity has also been suggested. Microbial infection has been known to trigger psoriasis and PsA. Recent clinical studies using biopharmaceuticals, such as tumor-necrosis-factor- (TNF-) α inhibitors and IL-12/23 p40 antibodies, indicate  that studies need not be based only on the immunological phenomena observed in PsA pathology since disease pathology can now be verified using human-based science. Considering this aspect, this paper discusses the immunopathology of PsA compared to psoriasis (cutaneous) and rheumatoid arthritis in humans and immunopathology of PsA with respect to the Th17/IL-23 axis and microbial infection."

We determined whether LN is associated with specific patterns of inflammatory cytokine expression in paired synovial tissue (ST) and fluid (SF) samples and their potential correlation with the clinical characteristics of PsA. METHODS: ST and paired SF samples were obtained from the inflamed knee of PsA patients. ST samples were immunostained with CD3 (T cell), CD20 (B cell), and MECA-79 (high endothelial vessels). Total ST mRNA was extracted, and the gene expression of 21 T-cell-derived and proinflammatory cytokines were measured with  quantitative real-time PCR. SF concentrations of Th1, Th2, Th17, and proinflammatory cytokines were determined with the Quantibody Human Th17 Array. Clinical and biologic data were collected at inclusion and after a median of 27 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty (43.5%) of 46 patients had LN. Only two genes showed differences  (Wilcoxon test, P < 0.06) in ST between LN-positive and LN-negative patients: interleukin-23A (IL-23A) (P = 0.058) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β1) (P = 0.050). IL-23A expression was higher, and TGF-β1 expression was lower in LN-positive patients. ST IL-15 mRNA showed a nonsignificant trend toward higher expression in LN-positive patients, and SF IL-15 protein levels were significantly higher in LN-positive patients (P = 0.002). In all PsA patients, IL-23A mRNA expression correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) (r = 0.471; P = 0.001) and swollen-joint count (SJC) (r = 0.350; P = 0.018), whereas SF levels of IL-6 and CC chemokine-ligand 20 (CCL-20) correlated with CRP levels (r = 0.377; P = 0.014 and r = 0.501; P < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest differences in the cytokine profile of PsA patients with LN, with a higher expression of IL-23A and IL-15 and a lower expression of TGF-β1. In the entire group of patients, IL-23 ST expression and CCL20 SF levels strongly correlated with markers of disease activity. This cytokine pattern was not accompanied by gross clinical or biologic differences between LN-positive and -negative patients. Taken together, these results suggest a role of the IL-17/IL-23 cytokine axis in synovial LN in PsA."

There is much evidence that different dendritic cell (DC) subsets, various proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. One of the early events in psoriatic inflammation is the secretion of interferon (IFN)-α by activated plasmacytoid DCs, a special DC subset present in symptomless psoriatic skin. Secreted IFN-α along with other proinflammatory cytokines can lead to monocyte-derived DC (moDC) development, which might contribute to T-helper (Th)1 and Th17 lymphocyte differentiation/activation and to keratinocyte proliferation. Recently it was proven that interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 play a critical role in this process. Additionally in psoriatic lesions, Th1 and Th17 lympocytes can interact with monocytes and instruct these cells to differentiate  into Th1- and Th17-promoting moDCs, further governing the formation and function  of specialized moDC subsets. The concept we present here focuses on the initial and central role of IFN-α, on the importance of other proinflammatory cytokines,  on TLR stimulation and on the effect of T lymphocytes in priming moDCs, which may play an important role in initiating and maintaining psoriasis."

IL-23, a key cytokine that induces T(H)17 cells, has been found to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Apilimod is a small-molecule compound that selectively suppresses synthesis of IL-12 and IL-23. An open-label clinical study of oral administration of apilimod was conducted in patients with psoriasis. Substantial improvements in histology and clinical measurements were observed in patients receiving 70 mg QD. The expression of IL-23p19 and IL-12/IL-23p40 in skin lesions was significantly reduced in this dose group, with a simultaneous increase in IL-10 observed. A decrease in the levels of T(H)1 and T(H)17 cytokines/chemokines in skin lesions followed these p19 and p40 changes. In parallel, a reduction in skin-infiltrating CD11c(+) dendritic cells and CD3(+) T cells was seen, with a greater decrease in  the CD11c(+) population. This was accompanied by increases in T and B cells, and  decreases in neutrophils and eosinophils in the periphery.

To identify superior surface markers to isolate a homogeneous population of Th17(EM) cells from peripheral blood, CD4(+) T cells were isolated  from the peripheral blood of healthy donors based on the expression of CCR7, CCR6 and CD146 using six-color flow cytometry. After 4days of culture in the presence  of anti-CD3/28 beads, intracellular cytokines were determined by flow cytometric  analysis. To investigate the relevance of Th17(EM) cells in Th17-mediated disease, the frequencies of T(EM) -cell subsets in psoriasis were quantified using six-color flow cytometry. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to confirm the interleukin (IL)-17-producing capacity of T(EM) -cell subsets from the peripheral blood of a patient with psoriasis. CCR6(+) CD146(+) T(EM) (CD4(+) CD45RA(-) CCR7(-)) cells had a greater capacity to produce IL-17 than CCR6(+) CD146(-) or CCR6(-) CD146(+) T(EM) cells. Although the percentage of CCR6(+) CD146(+) cells in T(EM) cells was not significantly different between patients with psoriasis and controls, three of eight patients had a higher percentage of CCR6(+) CD146(+) T(EM) cells than the mean +5 standard deviations of the controls. Coexpression of CCR6 and CD146 is a useful marker for Th17(EM) cells. Increasing the number of CCR6(+) CD146(+) Th17(EM) cells in peripheral blood may facilitate estimation of systemic Th17-cell activity in Th17-mediated diseases."

OBJECTIVES: To better define mechanisms by which etanercept improves psoriasis and to gain insight into disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We investigated the early biochemical and cellular effects of etanercept on skin lesions in responder patients prior to substantial clinical improvement (≤ 4 weeks). RESULTS: By 1 week, etanercept acutely suppressed gene expression of the interleukin (IL)-20 subfamily of cytokines (IL-19, IL-20, IL-24), which were found to be predominantly epidermis-derived and which are implicated in stimulating epidermal hyperplasia. Additionally, by 1 week of therapy, suppression of other keratinocyte-derived products (chemokines, antimicrobial proteins) occurred, while suppression of epidermal regenerative hyperplasia occurred within 1-3 weeks. Th17 elements (IL-23p19, IL-12p40, IL-17A, IL-22) were suppressed by 3-4 weeks. In vitro, TNF-α and IL-17A coordinately stimulated the expression of the IL-20 subfamily in normal keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the rapid suppression of regenerative hyperplasia, chemokines and other keratinocyte-derived products, including the IL-20 subfamily, we propose that epidermal activation is a very early target of etanercept. As many of these keratinocyte markers are stimulated by TNF-α, their  rapid downregulation is likely to reflect etanercepts antagonism of TNF-α. Additionally, decreased epidermal hyperplasia might result specifically from acute suppression of the IL-20 subfamily, which is also a likely consequence of etanercepts antagonism of TNF-α. Thus, the IL-20 subfamily has potential importance in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and therapeutic response to etanercept."

We aimed to evaluate whether there is a difference in the level of this cytokine according to clinical subtypes of psoriasis. 70 psoriasis patients (30 plaque psoriasis, 20 guttate psoriasis, and 20 pustular psoriasis) and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included in the study. Serum IL-17 levels were determined by ELISA. Skin biopsies obtained from lesions and non-lesional skin area of 12 patients and healthy individuals (n = 5) were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure the mRNA levels of IL-17. Statistically, the serum IL-17 levels did not exhibit any difference between the patients and control groups. However, analysis of each subgroup revealed that the IL-17 levels were significantly higher in pustular psoriasis group (10.09 ± 12.6 pg/ml) than controls (4.4 ± 4.1 pg/ml) (p = 0.02). In addition, the IL-17 levels of plaque psoriasis patients with PASI score ≥10 (11.30 ± 6.0 pg/ml) were significantly higher than that of patients with PASI score <10 (3.39 ± 2.6 pg/ml) and controls  (p < 0.001). The Pearson correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the serum IL-17 levels and PASI. Lesional skin samples of psoriasis patients showed significantly higher levels of IL-17 mRNA compared with perilesional skin samples (p = 0.017). Also, in the pustular psoriasis, IL-17 mRNA levels were found to be distinctively high in comparison with other clinical subtypes and healthy controls.

In last few years, the discovery of interleukin  (IL)-23/Th17 axis in pathophysiology of psoriatic diseases shifts the cytokine paradigm from Th1 to Th17 cytokines, focused mainly on IL-17 and IL-22. Therapeutic experiences strongly support the use of cytokine antagonists as an important modality in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis.  Studies examining these therapeutic agents which target different steps of the psoriatic inflammatory cascade have also shown significant efficacy. The relatively new IL-23/Th17 axis in psoriatic diseases got more importance with the success of ustekinumab, a new monoclonal antibody against IL-12 and IL-23. In IL-17 and IL-22 knock-out and transgenic mouse models, it has been found that recombinant IL-23 fails to produce epidermal hyperplasia which resembles psoriasis. Also, some success in animal models of psoriasis was found with anti IL-17A and anti IL-22. More studies are needed to validate the efficacy and safety of these cytokine antagonists in psoriatic diseases.

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying α-MSH-induced immunosuppression, we investigated whether α-MSH affects dendritic cell/T cell communication, as especially this interaction has an important role in the regulation of immune responses. Here, we show that α-MSH, by binding to MC-1R, induced tolerogenic dendritic cells, which  were capable of expanding CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vitro, as well as in vivo. Notably, those α-MSH-induced Tregs were functional as  they efficiently inhibited cutaneous contact allergy and ongoing psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice. Furthermore, α-MSH induced tolerogenic dendritic cells capable of generating functional Tregs in human blood. Interestingly, human Tregs expanded via α-MSH-stimulated dendritic cells suppressed the proliferation and cytokine secretion of pathogenic T-helper-17 (Th17) cells from individuals with psoriasis.

They act synergistically as chemoattractants and alarmins to amplify inflammation in psoriasis. Th17 cytokines are key players in psoriasis pathogenesis and vitamin D analogs feature anti-psoriatic effects; both of these activities could be mediated through epidermal AMP regulation. We show that supernatants of cultured psoriatic T cells induce and release psoriasin and koebnerisin from keratinocytes and the Th17 cytokines IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-22 differently regulate psoriasin and koebnerisin reflecting their distinct expression pattern in normal  and psoriatic skin. IL-17A is the principal inducer of both S100 and their expression is further amplified by cooperating Th17 cytokines in the micromilieu  of psoriatic skin. Increased extracellular psoriasin and koebnerisin also synergize as alarmins to prime epidermal keratinocytes for production of immunotropic cytokines that further amplify the inflammatory response. Treatment  of psoriatic plaques with the vitamin D analog calcipotriol interferes with the S100-mediated positive feedback loop by suppressing the increased production of psoriasin and koebnerisin in psoriatic skin and their Th17-mediated regulation in epidermal keratinocytes.

Readers will gain a comprehensive overview about the mechanism of action of emerging treatments targeting various immune pathways deeply involved in psoriasis. Pathogenesis, clinical efficacy and safety data for these treatments are discussed where available. EXPERT OPINION: Psoriasis remains a heavily undertreated systemic immune-mediated disease despite increased understanding of immunopathogenesis of the disease and  advent of a multitude of novel therapeutic agents with potentially improved bioavailability and safety profiles. Limitations, however, remain in the realm of topical agents for treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis, which has seen little progress over the years.

In the last couple of years, many articles are coming out on the role of Th17 and its signature cytokine IL-17 in different autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), SLE and multiple sclerosis. Psoriasis and PsA are immune-mediated diseases, affecting the skin and joints, respectively. Initially, it was thought that psoriasis and PsA were Th1-mediated diseases; however, studies in knockout animal models (IL-17 knockout mice) as well as human experimental data indicate that Th17 and its signature cytokine IL-17 have a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic disease. Th17 cells have been identified from the dermal extracts of psoriatic lesions. Subsequently, our research group has substantiated this observation that Th17 cells are enriched in the papillary dermis of psoriatic plaques and in freshly isolated effector T lymphocytes from the synovial fluid of PsA patients, and we have reported that the majority of these CD4 + IL-17+ T cells are of memory phenotype (CD4RO(+)CD45RA(-)CD11a(+)). Recent reports also suggest that the synovial tissue in psoriatic arthritis is enriched with IL-17R, and its most well recognized receptor IL-17RA is functionally active in psoriatic arthritis. In this review article, we have discussed the role of IL-17 in psoriatic disease and have narrated about the novel IL17/IL-17R antibodies currently in preparation for its  therapeutic uses in autoimmune diseases."

Although CsA and Tac are frequently utilized, their pharmacological mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated.In the present study, we focused on the effects of CsA and Tac on cytokine secretion from purified human memory CD4(+)T cells and the differentiation of naïve T cells into cytokine-producing memory T cells. CsA or Tac significantly inhibited IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17 production from memory T cells.

The present review focuses on current knowledge of the regulation, functional mechanisms and targeting strategies of IL-17 in the context of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Evidence  shows that IL-17 is highly up-regulated at sites of inflammatory tissues of autoimmune diseases and amplifies the inflammation through synergy with other cytokines, such as TNF (tumour necrosis factor) α. Although IL-17 was originally  thought to be produced mainly by Th17 cells, a newly defined T-cell subset with a specific differentiation programme and tight regulation, several other cell types (especially innate immune cells) are also found as important sources for IL-17 production. Although IL-17 activates common downstream signalling, including NF-κB (nuclear factor κB), MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), C/EBPs (CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins) and mRNA stability, the immediate receptor signalling has been shown to be quite unique and tightly regulated. Mouse genetic studies have demonstrated a critical role for IL-17 in the pathogenesis of variety of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and MS (multiple sclerosis). Importantly, promising results have been shown in initial clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 or its receptor (IL-17R) to block IL-17-mediated function in treating autoimmune patients with psoriasis, RA and MS. Therefore targeting IL-17/IL-17R, IL-17-producing pathways  or IL-17-mediated signalling pathways can be considered for future therapy in autoimmune diseases."

The cause and the pathogenesis of these diseases are unknown; however, there is increasing evidence which suggest that cytotoxic CD8T  cells, Th1 and Th17 may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Cytokines produced as the result of Th1 and Th17 responses, such as TNF-α and IL-17, play a key role in the chronic inflammatory response observed in the joints of psoriatic arthritis patients.

IL-23 is essential for the differentiation of Th17 lymphocytes, a subtype of T lymphocyte implicated in chronic inflammatory/autoimmune mediated diseases. IL-23 and Th17 correspond to a new axis that drives immune activation and chronic inflammation through the differentiation and activation of Th17 cells. Animal models of chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic joint diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases and demyelinating diseases strongly suggest the involvement of this cytokine pathway. Thus, IL-23/Th17 is considered as a relevant therapeutic target in autoimmune driven diseases, and biological agents  blocking IL-23 or IL-17 are currently being developed. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the common p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. This treatment has demonstrated its efficacy over placebo in randomized placebo controlled trials and is currently licensed for the treatment of psoriasis. It has also demonstrated its efficacy in psoriatic arthritis. Results for Crohns disease were less evident, while ustekinumab was ineffective in multiple sclerosis. Secukinumab is an IL-17A monoclonal antibody that is under development and preliminary results have suggested its efficacy in inflammatory mediated diseases such as psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Several other IL-23 or IL-17 neutralizing agents are being evaluated in clinical trials. The biological  properties of the IL-23/Th17/IL-17 axis and the clinical applications of the drugs that aim to block its functions are reviewed here. Targeting the IL-23/Th17 axis seems to be a relevant and realistic therapeutic approach and these new agents pave the way for additive and alternative treatments to currently available biologics in chronic inflammatory diseases."

As IFN-γ is involved in many cellular processes, including activation of dendritic cells (DCs), antigen processing and presentation, cell adhesion and trafficking, and cytokine and chemokine production, IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells were proposed to be integral to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Recently, IFN-γ was shown to enhance IL-23 and IL-1 production by DCs and subsequently induce Th17 cells, which are important contributors to the inflammatory cascade in psoriatic lesions. To determine whether IFN-γ indeed induces the pathways expressed in psoriatic lesions, a single intradermal injection of IFN-γ was administered to an area of clinically normal, non-lesional (NL) skin of psoriasis patients and biopsies were collected 24 hours later. Although there were no visible changes in the skin, IFN-γ induced many molecular and histological features characteristic of psoriatic lesions. IFN-γ increased a number of differentially expressed genes in the skin, including many chemokines concomitant with an influx of T cells and inflammatory DCs. Furthermore, inflammatory DC products tumor necrosis factor (TNF), inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-23, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand were present in IFN-γ-treated skin. Thus, IFN-γ, which is significantly elevated in NL skin compared with healthy skin, appears to be a key pathogenic cytokine that can induce many features of the inflammatory cascade of psoriasis."

To determine differences between psoriasis patients and healthy donors, expression of galectins was analysed by RT-PCR in skin samples and on epidermal and peripheral blood dendritic cells by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. In the skin of healthy donors, galectin-1, -3 and -9 were expressed in a high proportion of Langerhans cells. Also, galectins were differentially expressed in peripheral blood dendritic cell subsets; galectin-1 and galectin-9 were highly expressed in peripheral myeloid dendritic cells compared with plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We found that non-lesional as well as lesional skin samples from psoriasis patients had low levels of galectin-1 at the mRNA and protein levels, in parallel with low levels  of IL-10 mRNA compared with skin from healthy patients. However, only lesional skin samples expressed high levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines. The analysis of galectin-1 expression showed that this protein was down-regulated in Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells as well as in peripheral blood CD11c(+) DCs from psoriasis patients. Expression of galectin-1 correlated with IL-17 and IL-10 expression and with the psoriasis area and index activity. Addition of galectin-1 to co-cultures of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells with autologous T lymphocytes from psoriasis patients attenuated the Th1 response. Conversely, blockade of galectin binding increased IFNγ production and inhibited IL-10 secretion in co-cultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells with CD4(+) T cells. Our results suggest a model in which galectin-1 down-regulation contributes to the exacerbation of the Th1/Th17 effector response in psoriasis patients."

We developed K5.TGFβ1 mice with latent human TGFβ1 overexpression targeted to epidermal keratinocytes by keratin  5. These transgenic mice developed significant skin inflammation. Further studies revealed that inflammation severity correlated with switching TGFβ1 transgene expression on and off, and genome wide expression profiling revealed striking similarities between K5.TGFβ1 skin and human psoriasis, a Th1/Th17-associated inflammatory skin disease. Our recent study reveals that treatments alleviating inflammatory skin phenotypes in this mouse model reduced Th17 cells, and antibodies against IL-17 also lessen the inflammatory phenotype. Examination of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines affected by TGFβ1 revealed predominantly Th1-,  Th17-related cytokines in K5.TGFβ1 skin. However, the finding that K5.TGFβ1 mice  also express Th2-associated inflammatory cytokines under certain pathological conditions raises the possibility that deregulated TGFβ signaling is involved in  more than one inflammatory disease. Furthermore, activation of both Th1/Th17 cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) by TGFβ1 reversely regulated by IL-6 highlights the dual role of TGFβ1 in regulating inflammation, a dynamic, context  and organ specific process.

In psoriasis pathogenesis an over-reaction  of local innate immune response initiates inflammation with subsequent involvement of adaptive immune response leading to the production of a panel of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors leading to epidermal hyperplasia. Recently, IL-21 has been involved in this process as this cytokine is overexpressed in psoriatic skin and can cause epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation when injected intradermally into mice. Moreover blockade of IL-21 with a human antibody against IL-21 reduces the epidermal thickness and the expression of Th1 and Th17 genes in the well-characterized model of human psoriasis-xenograft mouse.

AIM: To understand the characteristics of slanDCs as a new population of dermal DCs in the context of other DC populations in healthy and psoriatic skin. METHODS: We immunofluorescently stained skin samples from healthy controls and from patients with psoriasis. RESULTS: Staining healthy skin for DCs showed that slanDCs (CD1a- CD1c- CD11c- CD14- CD163-) were present at a similar frequency to that of CD1c+ CD11c+ CD1a+ CD14- CD163- dermal DCs, which have previously been regarded as the major population of resident DCs. In psoriatic skin, the frequency of slanDCs and CD1c+ DCs was doubled, and the slanDCs expressed CD11c. In-depth analysis of DCs in psoriatic skin by four-colour immunofluorescence analysis showed that the pool of CD11c+ cells could be further subdivided into CD11c+ CD14+ CD163- DCs and CD11c+  CD163+ CD14+ macrophages.

We hypothesized that miRNAs contribute to the mechanism underlying the overexpression of IL-17. Therefore, serum levels of miR-1266, a putative regulator of IL-17A, in psoriasis patients were determined with the expectation that miR-1266 levels may be decreased in these patients, which may result in induction of IL-17. However, real-time PCR demonstrated that serum miR-1266 levels were considerably higher in psoriasis patients than in healthy control subjects. Furthermore, miR-1266 levels showed weak inverse correlations with Psoriasis Area Severity Index scores and body surface areas of involved skin.

At the macroscopic level, scaly skin lesions induced by daily applications of imiquimod in wild-type mice were almost totally  absent in IL-22-deficient mice or in mice treated with a blocking anti-IL-22 Ab.  At the microscopic level, IL-22-deficient mice showed a dramatic decrease in the  development of pustules and a partial decrease in acanthosis. At the molecular level, the absence or inhibition of IL-22 strongly decreased the expression of chemotactic factors such as CCL3 and CXCL3 and of biomarkers such as S100A8, S100A7, and keratin 14, which reflect the antimicrobial and hyperproliferative responses of keratinocytes. IL-22 also played a major role in neutrophil infiltration after imiquimod treatment. IL-23 was required for IL-22 production,  and γδ TCR lymphocytes represented the major source of IL-22 in lymph nodes from  imiquimod-treated mice. However, T cells were not absolutely required for IL-22 production because imiquimod-induced IL-22 expression in the skin is still preserved in Rag2(-/-) mice.

The mechanism underlying this increased sensitivity of Pglyrp2(-/-) mice to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced psoriasis-like  inflammation is reduced recruitment of regulatory T cells to the skin and enhanced production and activation of Th17 cells in the skin in Pglyrp2(-/-) mice, which results in more severe inflammation and keratinocyte proliferation. Thus, in wild type mice, Pglyrp2 limits overactivation of Th17 cells by promoting accumulation of regulatory T cells at the site of inflammation, which protects the skin from the exaggerated inflammatory response."

First, we show in humans that fumarate treatment induces IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo and generates type II dendritic cells (DCs) that produce IL-10 instead of IL-12 and IL-23. In mice, fumarates also generate type II DCs that induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vitro and in vivo and protect mice from experimental  autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Type II DCs result from fumarate-induced glutathione (GSH) depletion, followed by increased hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and impaired STAT1 phosphorylation. Induced HO-1 is cleaved, whereupon the N-terminal fragment of HO-1 translocates into the nucleus and interacts with  AP-1 and NF-κB sites of the IL-23p19 promoter. This interaction prevents IL-23p19 transcription without affecting IL-12p35, whereas STAT1 inactivation prevents IL-12p35 transcription without affecting IL-23p19. As a consequence, GSH depletion by small molecules such as fumarates induces type II DCs in mice and in humans that ameliorate inflammatory autoimmune diseases.

Additionally, the ratio of T helper  type 17 (Th17) cells to CD4+ cells in patients with thymoma-associated multi-organ autoimmunity and acute GVHD was higher than that in healthy controls, but similar to that in psoriasis vulgaris patients. Similarity of the skin-infiltrating T cell subsets with those of acute GVHD suggested that skin damage in patients with thymoma-associated multi-organ autoimmunity might be induced by self-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes under the diminished suppressive capacity of T(regs)."

Large numbers of CCR6(+) cells were detected at or above the level of  the epidermal basement membrane by confocal microscopy 5 d after repeated IL-23 injections at the same time GDL cells increased in numbers in the epidermis. TCR  δ-deficient mice (lacking γδ T cells) exhibited decreased ear swelling and downregulated expression of IL-22 and IL-17A in the epidermis following IL-23 injection.

Imiquimod-induced skin pathology was also significantly decreased in Tcrd(-/-) mice. Perhaps further promoting disease progression, IL-23 stimulated dermal γδ T cell expansion. In psoriasis patients, γδ T cells were greatly increased in affected skin and produced large amounts of IL-17. Thus, IL-23-responsive dermal γδ T cells are the major IL-17 producers in the skin and  may represent a novel target for the treatment of psoriasis."

Synoviocytes (FLS) were isolated from the synovium of RA (n=5), PsA (n=5) and OA (n=5) patients. IL-17RA expression in FLS was identified by western blotting (WB) and flowcytometry. T lymphocytes derived from the SF of these patients were studied to identify and phenotype the Th17 cells. The functional significance of IL-17RA was determined by evaluating its regulatory role on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and endopeptidase. IL-17RA expression was found to be significantly higher in FLS of RA (15.7%±4.9) and PsA  (4.5%±0.9) in comparison to OA (1.14%±0.9). Western blot analyses showed that the relative intensity (RI) of IL-17RA protein was higher in RA and PsA compared to OA (Fisher exact, P<0.01). A significant enrichment of IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells (7.9%±2.8) was observed in the SF of PsA patients compared to that of OA patients (P<.001).

We investigated the regulatory interactions of the IL-1-like IL-36 cytokine family and the Th17 cytokines in the context of skin inflammation. We observed increased gene expression of all three IL-36 cytokines  in a Th17-dominant psoriasis-like animal model. The induction was downregulated by neutralizing IL-22. Expression of the IL-36s was also induced in cultured primary human keratinocytes (KC) by IL-17A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-22 synergized with IL-17A and TNF-α. Furthermore, the IL-36s directly induced  their own expression and the production of proinflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8) in KC. These functions were markedly enhanced with the addition of IL-17A or TNF-α to the cultures. Similarly, IL-36α and IL-36β augmented IL-17A-mediated induction of antibacterial peptides. Finally, we show that the increased gene expression of IL-36 correlated with Th17 cytokines in the lesions  of psoriatic patients. Our results indicate that the IL-36 cytokines are not only regulated by Th17 cytokines, but that they themselves can regulate the expression and enhance the function of Th17 cytokines.

METHODS: The study population included 19 psoriasis patients treated with etanercept and 19 healthy subjects. Blood samples were collected at baseline and  every 4 weeks during treatment. Taqman quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to analyse the expression of: Stat-4, T-bet, IL-12p35 and IFN-γ (Th1-related); GATA-3, IL-4 (Th2-related); Stat-3, RORγt, IL-23p19 (Th17-related); Foxp3, IL-2 (Treg-related). Flow cytometry was applied to analyse CD4+CD25+(bright)Foxp3+ cells in peripheral blood. RESULTS: Upregulation of Th1 and Th17 and downregulation of Treg subsets was found at baseline. The response to etanercept could be associated with a significant reversal of the Th1/Th17 activation, and a concomitant upregulation of Th2 and Treg subsets.

Curr Pharm Des. 2011;17(29):3176-90.","A pathogenetic approach to autoimmune skin disease therapy: psoriasis and biological drugs, unresolved issues, and future directions.","Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease with a complex pathophysiology and a  multigenic background. Autoimmunity and genetic hallmarks couple to confer the disease, which is characterized by chronic plaques (85-90% of all cases) and/or psoriasis arthritis (PsA), and involve the peripheral and sacro-iliac joints, nails, and skeleton. Dissecting the ethiopathogenetic mechanisms of psoriasis and PsA is a major basic research challenge. One important question is whether a single inflammatory mediator can be responsible for the interactive network that  forms between immune cells and cytokines in this disease. Despite much progress,  no research has yet been able to define a single model to explain the multifaceted pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA. It is known that both the innate  and adaptive immune systems are involved, antigen presenting cells and T lymphocytes play a prominent role, and that the deregulation of the T helper (Th)- 1/Th-2/Th-17/Th-23 axis is directly implicated in disease pathogenesis. Pharmacological therapy for psoriasis has evolved with the development of human knowledge of the disease pathophysiology. Thus, the first ethiopathogenetic drugs (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporin, and alefacept) inhibited T-cell activation directly or targeted co-accessory molecules implicated in T-cell activation. When the mechanism underlying psoriatic inflammation was accepted as  a cytokine network disorder, more specific biologics were studied in murine models and were later used clinically. Tumor necrosis factor was the first successful target of cytokine inhibition therapy for psoriasis and PsA (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept). With the recently discovered role for Th-17 in autoimmunity, drugs targeting interleukin-23 (ustekinumab) have become accepted for the pharmacological treatment of psoriasis. The expansion of pharmacological treatment options for psoriasis is not complete. As the knowledge of pathogenetic mechanisms increases, it may be possible to design therapeutic approaches that selectively target the ethiopathogenetic cells or cytokines while sparing the others. In this way, using a more targeted drug therapy may preserve  the integrity of the immune system. Thus, one great struggle in treating this complex disease is the challenge to synthesize the perfect drug."

The presence of innate immune cells and their products in psoriatic skin plaques suggests a role for innate immunity in this disease.

Correspondingly, in acute atopic dermatitis, T(H)2 cells interact with monocytes and elicit the formation of T(H)2-promoting DCs. DC formation requires GM-CSF and cell contact, whereas T(H)  subset specific cytokines dictate DC function and the expression of DC subset specific surface molecules.

In this study, we demonstrate that wild-type and mutant HERV-K dUTPase proteins induce the activation of NF-κB through Toll-like receptor 2, independent of enzymatic activity. Proteome array studies revealed that treatment of human primary cells with wild-type and mutant HERV-K dUTPase proteins triggered the secretion of T(H)1 and T(H)17 cytokines involved in the formation of psoriatic plaques, including IL-12p40, IL-23, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-8, and CCL20, in dendritic/Langerhans-like cells and to a lesser extent in keratinocytes.

PsA has several unique characteristics, such as  enthesopathy, dactylitis and abnormal bone remodeling. Genetic, environmental, and immunological factors are important in its development. The triggering role of physical stress is seen in the deep Koebner phenomenon, which causes inflammation in the synovial membrane and in enthesis, resulting in peripheral arthritis.

AD is a T(H)2/T(H)22-dominant disease, whereas psoriasis is considered a T(H)1/T(H)17 disease. Local immune deviation is suggested to be regulated by dendritic cell (DC)-induced T-cell polarization and recruitment of specific T-cell subsets by chemokines. Although the role of chemokines is well documented, the actual contribution of DCs to activate polar T-cell subsets in human subjects is still a matter of speculation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to elucidate the significance of each cutaneous DC subset in disease-specific T-cell immune deviation. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of major cutaneous resident (Langerhans cells and blood dendritic cell antigen 1-positive dermal DCs) and inflammatory (inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells and blood dendritic cell antigen 1-negative dermal DCs) DC subsets directly isolated from the lesional skin of patients with AD and those with psoriasis. RESULTS: The ability of each DC subset to expand T(H)1, T(H)2, T(H)17, and T(H)22 subsets was similar between the 2 diseases, despite the association of both with  accumulation of resident and inflammatory DCs. We also confirmed differential upregulation of chemokine expression in patients with AD (CCL17, CCL18, and CCL22) and psoriasis (CXCL1, IL-8, and CCL20). The expression of CCL17 and CCL22  was higher in Langerhans cells from patients with AD than from patients with psoriasis, whereas the opposite was observed for CXCL9 and CXCL10. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that DC polarity does not directly drive differential T-cell subset responses. Alternatively, disease-specific chemokines  might recruit specific memory T-cell subsets into the skin, which in turn might be activated and expanded by DCs at the site of inflammation, maintaining differential immune polarity in these diseases."

In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles for TL1A, DR3 and DcR3 in the normal skin and in psoriatic skin lesions. By use of immunohistochemistry, we were able to demonstrate constitutive cutaneous expression of DR3 and DcR3 but not of TL1A in healthy skin. On the other hand, in patients with active psoriasis, we observed abundant  immunostaining for TL1A and significant upregulation of its receptors (P < 0.05 in comparison to healthy skin). TL1A, DR3 and DcR3 proteins, as well as mRNA transcripts reflecting in situ production of TL1A and DcR3, were also specifically increased in lesional as compared to non-lesional skin from patients with psoriasis (P < 0.05). These proteins were upregulated in cell populations that are critically involved in the pathogenesis of chronic skin inflammation, such as keratinocytes, macrophages in deep dermis and cells at the perivascular/endothelial area. Finally, we provide evidence for the existence of  nuclear localization of TL1A in inflammatory cells from psoriatic lesions.

In addition, CD4+CD25(high) regulatory T-cell (Treg) function appeared to be impaired in psoriasis. CD4+CD25(high)Foxp3+ Tregs are typically considered inhibitors of autoimmune responses. However, under proinflammatory conditions, Tregs can differentiate into inflammation-associated Th17 cells--a paradigm shift, with as yet largely unknown consequences for human disease initiation or progression. Th17 cells are highly proinflammatory T cells that are characterized by IL-17A and IL-22 production and expression of the transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt). We here show that Tregs of patients with severe psoriasis, as compared with those of healthy controls, have  an enhanced propensity to differentiate into IL-17A-producing cells on ex vivo stimulation. This enhanced Treg differentiation was linked to unexpectedly high RORγt levels and enhanced loss of Foxp3. Notably, IL-23 boosted this Treg differentiation process particularly in patients with psoriasis but less so in controls. IL-23 further reduced Foxp3 expression while leaving the high RORγt levels unaffected.

By expression microarray, we previously found the GATA3 transcription factor significantly downregulated in lesional psoriatic skin. Since GATA3 serves as a key switch in both epidermal and T helper cell differentiation, we investigated its function in psoriasis. Because psoriatic skin inflammation shares many characteristics of epidermal regeneration during wound healing, we also studied GATA3 expression under such conditions.Psoriatic lesional skin showed decreased GATA3 mRNA and protein expression compared to non-lesional skin. GATA3 expression was also markedly decreased in inflamed skin of mice with a psoriasiform dermatitis induced with imiquimod. Tape-stripping of non-lesional skin of patients with psoriasis, a standardized psoriasis-triggering and skin regeneration-inducing technique, reduced the expression of GATA3. In wounded skin of mice, low GATA3 mRNA and protein expression was detected. Taken together, GATA3 expression is downregulated under regenerative and inflammatory hyperproliferative skin conditions. GATA3 expression could be re-induced by successful narrow-band UVB treatment of both human psoriasis and imiquimod-induced psoriasiform dermatitis in mice. The prototypic Th2 cytokine IL-4 was the only cytokine capable of inducing GATA3 in skin explants from healthy donors. Based on these findings we argue that GATA3 serves as a key regulator in psoriatic inflammation, keratinocyte hyperproliferation and skin barrier dysfunction."

The p40 subunit is shared with IL-12. IL-23 and IL-12 have different receptors and different effects. Whereas IL-12 induces development of Th1 cells,  which produce interferon-γ, IL-23 is involved in differentiation of Th17 cells in a pro-inflammatory context and especially in the presence of TGF-β and IL-6. Activated Th17 cells produce IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-22, TNF-α, and GM-CSF. Inflammatory macrophages express IL-23R and are activated by IL-23 to produce IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-23 itself. These effects identify IL-23 as a central cytokine in autoimmunity and a highly promising treatment target for inflammatory diseases. IL-23 is found in the skin of patients with psoriasis, in the bowel wall of patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and in synovial membrane of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. IL-23 is involved in osteoclastogenesis, independently from IL-17, via induction of RANKL expression.  Debate continues to surround the role for IL-23 in the pathophysiology of inflammatory joint diseases (rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis). Ustekinumab, which inhibits IL-12 and IL-23 by blocking p40, has been found effective in cutaneous psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, as well as in Crohns disease. Treatments that specifically target IL-23 (antibodies to p19) are being  developed."

Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 produced by Th1/Th17 lymphocytes induce IL-8 secretion by keratinocytes, a key event in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is now clear that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2) activity is  required for IL-17-induced IL-8 synthesis by keratinocytes, and, in fact, MAPK activity is increased in lesional psoriatic skin. Here, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo on primary psoriatic lesions that pharmacological inhibitors of ERKs as well as hydrogen sulfide not only reduce the basal expression and secretion of IL-8, but also interfere with IL-17- and IL-22-induced IL-8 production. These observations, together with the known anti-inflammatory activity of H₂S, are relevant to understanding some previously unexplained biological effects exerted by sulfur therapy."

A recent study has demonstrated that Th1 cells, but not Th2 cells, produce an endogenous ligand  for Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, namely extradomain A+ fibronectin containing extra type III domain A (FnEDA+). As TLR4 stimulation leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines that recruit (via altered endothelial adhesion molecule expression and chemokine production) more Th1/Th17 cells, a positive feedback mechanism for Th1/Th17 inflammation exists. We propose that FnEDA+ positive feedback loops are a potential driver of Th1/Th17 inflammation. Conversely, the inflammatory EDA+ fibronectin loop is negatively regulated in atopic dermatitis,  Th2 cytokines actively suppress TLR4 expression of Th1 cytokines, and recruited Th2 cells do not produce FnEDA+. In psoriasis, there are multiple FnEDA+ loops, comprising inflammatory, keratinocyte, and autoimmune loops. In allergic contact  dermatitis, a single inflammatory loop operates. In atopic dermatitis, the FnEDA+ loop is actively suppressed by Th2 cytokines, and recruited Th2 cells do not feedback FnEDA+. We review endogenous ligands for TLR in relation to inflammatory disease, FnEDA+ function, and the potential role for FnEDA+ in psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis."

Genome-wide association studies in humans have linked genes involved in T(H)17 cell differentiation and function with susceptibility to Crohns disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Thus, the pathway towards differentiation of T(H)17 cells and, perhaps, of related innate lymphoid cells with similar effector functions, is an attractive target for therapeutic applications. Mouse and human  T(H)17 cells are distinguished by expression of the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor RORγt, which is required for induction of IL-17 transcription and for the manifestation of T(H)17-dependent autoimmune disease in mice. By performing a chemical screen with an insect cell-based reporter system, we identified the cardiac glycoside digoxin as a specific inhibitor of RORγt transcriptional activity. Digoxin inhibited murine T(H)17 cell differentiation without affecting differentiation of other T cell lineages and was effective in delaying the onset and reducing the severity of autoimmune disease in mice. At high concentrations, digoxin is toxic for human cells, but non-toxic synthetic derivatives 20,22-dihydrodigoxin-21,23-diol and digoxin-21-salicylidene specifically inhibited induction of IL-17 in human CD4(+) T cells. Using these small-molecule compounds, we demonstrate that RORγt is important for the maintenance of IL-17 expression in mouse and human effector T cells. These data indicate that derivatives of digoxin can be used as chemical templates for the development of RORγt-targeted therapeutic agents that attenuate inflammatory lymphocyte function and autoimmune disease."

To identify NB-UVB-induced molecular pathways that may account for its anti-inflammatory efficacy, gene expression profiling was performed using epidermal RNA from lesional and nonlesional skin from patients with psoriasis undergoing NB-UVB therapy. Downregulation of Th17 signaling pathway was observed  during NB-UVB therapy in psoriatic epidermis. Strong inhibition of the Th17 pathway by UVB was confirmed in an ex vivo organ culture system by demonstrating  reduced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and β-defensin-2 production. These results were further substantiated by demonstrating that NB-UVB inhibited the Th17-dependent psoriasis-like dermatitis in mice. Other pathways affected by NB-UVB therapy include the IFN signaling pathway, epidermal differentiation, and other well-known therapeutic targets in psoriasis, such as the glucocorticoid, vitamin  D, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and IL-4 signaling pathways. In conclusion, clinical improvement of psoriasis by NB-UVB is linked to suppression  of Th17 and type I and type II IFN signaling pathways, which are critical in the  pathogenesis of the disease.

The origin and identity of these inflammatory dermal DCs are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: We previously identified slanDCs (6-sulfo LacNAc) DCs as a rich source of TNF-α and as the early major source of IL-12. Here we studied the relevance of slanDCs as inflammatory dermal DCs in psoriasis. METHODS: Psoriasis skin samples were stained for the presence of activated slanDCs. Functional studies were carried out to determine the cytokine production of slanDCs, their T(h)17/T(h)1 T-cell programming, and their migration behavior. RESULTS: Large numbers of IL-23, TNF-α, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expressing slanDCs were found in psoriatic skin samples, which can be recruited by C5a, CX3CL1, and CXCL12. SlanDCs isolated from blood produced high levels of IL-1ß, IL-23, IL-12, and IL-6. Compared with classic CD1c(+) DCs, slanDCs were far more powerful in programming T(h)17/T(h)1 T cells that secrete IL-17, IL-22,  TNF-α, and IFN-γ, yet CD1c(+) DCs induced a higher IL-10 production of T cells. Self-nucleic acids complexed to cathelicidin LL37 trigger endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (TLR7, TLR8, TLR9) and are key factors for the activation of DCs in psoriasis. We show that slanDCs respond particularly well to complexes formed of self-RNA and LL37. Similarly, slanDCs stimulated with a synthetic TLR7/8 ligand produced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSION: Our study defines slanDCs as inflammatory dermal DCs in psoriasis and identifies their strong capacity to induce T(h)17/T(h)1 responses."

In acute anterior uveitis, these associations are also seen as well as a region on chromosome 9p and genes whose confirmation is under way. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis fall into this disease spectrum, with the  largest region of susceptibility coming from the MHC (most likely HLA-C, ie, C*06:02 although additional influences are also being implicated), and most of the other genetic susceptibility coming from genes involved in cytokine production, specifically genes in the Th17 pathway (IL-12B, IL-23A and IL-23R, the latter, like in AS, not seen in Asians), genes in the nuclear factor κB pathway (TNFAIP3 and TNIP1) and genes in the Th2 pathway (IL-4 and IL-13). Given  that more than half of patients with AS have evidence on colonoscopy of at least  occult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is not surprising that shared genetic influences are operative.

Furthermore, these recent advances have been fruitful in leading to the development of new classes of biologic therapeutics that are remarkably effective in halting the disease process."

MDP stimulation of these cells enhances their IL-6 production and may thus contribute to the immune and inflammatory activities in the skin. However, whether ECs are capable of influencing the development of T cell priming and its  polarization remains unknown. We report that in vitro the murine bEnd.3 EC line induces, following MDP stimulation, a Th17 polarization at the expense of Th1 and Th2 polarization in the setting of Langerhans cell (LC) Ag presentation to responsive T cells as assessed by IL-17, IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-4 production. Interestingly, IL-22 production, which has been associated with Th17 priming, was not influenced by MDP-treated bEnd.3 cells, illustrating differential regulation  of this cytokine from IL-17. Additional analysis confirmed a significantly increased percentage of IL-17(+)CD4(+) T cells by flow cytometry and an increased mRNA level of the specific Th17 transcription factor retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt in cocultures of LCs and responsive T cells in the presence of activated bEnd.3 cells. Experiments using the RNA interference technique to knockdown IL-6 in bEnd.3 cells confirmed that IL-6 produced by bEnd.3 cells stimulated by MDP is at least partially involved in Th17 polarization. Our data suggest that activated ECs are capable of influencing LC Ag processing and presentation to T cells and induce a Th17 polarization. These results are important for the understanding of Th17-related disorders of the skin such as psoriasis."

The chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis have seen notable successes culminating in the discovery of 99 published susceptibility loci/genes (71 Crohns disease; 47 ulcerative colitis) to date. Approximately one-third of loci  described confer susceptibility to both Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. Amongst these are multiple genes involved in IL23/Th17 signalling (IL23R, IL12B,  JAK2, TYK2 and STAT3), IL10, IL1R2, REL, CARD9, NKX2.3, ICOSLG, PRDM1, SMAD3 and  ORMDL3. The evolving genetic architecture of IBD has furthered our understanding  of disease pathogenesis. For Crohns disease, defective processing of intracellular bacteria has become a central theme, following gene discoveries in  autophagy and innate immunity (associations with NOD2, IRGM, ATG16L1 are specific to Crohns disease). Genetic evidence has also demonstrated the importance of barrier function to the development of ulcerative colitis (HNF4A, LAMB1, CDH1 and GNA12). However, when the data are analysed in more detail, deeper themes emerge  including the shared susceptibility seen with other diseases. Many immune-mediated diseases overlap in this respect, paralleling the reported epidemiological evidence. However, in several cases the reported shared susceptibility appears at odds with the clinical picture. Examples include both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this review we will detail the presently  available data on the genetic overlap between IBD and other diseases. The discussion will be informed by the epidemiological data in the published literature and the implications for pathogenesis and therapy will be outlined. This arena will move forwards very quickly in the next few years. Ultimately, we  anticipate that these genetic insights will transform the landscape of common complex diseases such as IBD."

We used K5.hTGF-β1 transgenic mice, which exhibit an inflammatory skin disorder and molecular and cytokine abnormalities with strong similarities to human psoriasis, to study the pathogenic role of PAF. We found that injecting PAF into the skin of transgenic mice led to inflammation  and accelerated manifestation of the psoriatic phenotype by a local effect. In contrast, injecting mice with PAF receptor antagonist PCA-4248 lowered the PAF level (most likely by depressing an autocrine loop) and neutrophil, CD68(+) cell  (monocyte/macrophage), and CD3(+) T-cell accumulation in the skin and blocked progression of the psoriasis-like phenotype. This effect of PAF blockade was specific and similar to that of psoralen-UV-A and was paralleled by a decrease in abnormally elevated mRNA and/or protein levels of T-helper type 17 cell-related cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-23, IL-12A, and IL-6 and its transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. In contrast, PCA-4248 treatment up-regulated mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-10 in dorsal skin and release of IL-10 in serum and skin.

Despite the importance of this disease there are currently limited therapeutic options indicating a need for effective, long-lasting treatment strategies with few side effects. The most recent discoveries regarding psoriasis pathogenesis, particularly our results regarding two cytokines - IL-22 and IL-20 - could prove to be the foundation for  such therapies. Whereas IL-22 is mainly produced by activated T-cell sub-populations (Th22, Th1, Th17), monocytes, dendritic cells and keratinocytes produce IL-20. Blood and lesional skin samples from psoriasis patients demonstrate high levels of IL-22 and IL-20. Interestingly, both cytokines act principally on keratinocytes and do not impact the immune system. Similar to the  changes in the psoriasis epidermis these cytokines inhibit the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes although they simultaneously increase their innate defense, mobility, and the production of some chemokines. Some IL-22 effects are amplified by TNF-α, IL-17, and IFN-α. IL-22/IL-20 lends the reconstructed epidermis a psoriasis-like appearance with acanthosis, hypogranularity, and hyperkeratosis. In addition, mice that constitutively express high levels of IL-22 or IL-20 demonstrate a psoriasis-like appearance. A  therapy counteracting IL-22 and IL-20 would be an innovative treatment with the potential for few side effects that would act on the final phase of psoriasis pathogenesis."

J UOEH. 2010 Dec 1;32(4):317-28.","Psoriasis and other Th17-mediated skin diseases.","T helper (Th) 17 cells have crucial functions in host defense, and dysregulated Th17 responses mediate a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Th17  cells coexpress interleukin (IL)-22, and its receptor is expressed on epidermal keratinocytes. IL-17 and IL-22 cooperatively enhance some immunological responses. A close relationship between IL-17 and the cutaneous milieu has been suggested by a number of observations. IL-17 induces the production of certain cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides by keratinocytes, and its cooperation with IL-22 has been documented. Recent findings have suggested that Th17 cells profoundly participate in the pathogenesis of certain skin disorders,  in particular, psoriasis. The concept of the subsets of T cells responsible for psoriasis has been modified in the order of Th1, T cytotoxic 1, and again Thl, and Thl7 cells. IL-22 is the strongest cytokine in the keratinocyte-proliferative ability. Since IL-22 is produced by Th17 cells, they are crucial for the proliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, IL-22 with the help of IL-17 can induce the critical events of psoriasis, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, cytokine/chemokine (IL-8 etc.) production, and antimicrobial peptide elaboration. For maintaining Th17 cells, IL-23 is required and is released from tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS)-producing dendritic cells (TIP-DCs). TIP-DCs are activated via an autocrine mechanism by virtue of TNF-alpha. The above cytokine network in the pathogenesis of psoriasis has been proven by the therapeutic effectiveness of cytokine-blocking biologics. Antibodies against TNF-alpha or its soluble receptor have already been widely used in the treatment  of psoriasis. The involvement of Th17 cells has also been shown in allergen-specific immune responses. The percentage of Th17 cells is increased in  the peripheral blood of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and associated with  the severity of AD. Drug eruption is another disease where Th17 cells are involved in the pathogenesis. The percentage of circulating Th17 cells are increased in drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, etc. Th17 cells and IL-22 are increased in patients with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Since  IL-17 and IL-22 cooperatively stimulate keratinocytes to produce IL-8, keratinocyte-derived IL-8 contributes to the accumulation ofneutrophils in the lesional epidermis of this drug eruption."

Based on PASI score system, three progressive clinical phases were identified: mild acute (8-14 weeks of age), moderate subacute (15-21 weeks of age) and severe chronic-active (22-44 weeks of age) dermatitis. Microscopically, skin lesions consisted of progressive proliferative  psoriatic-like dermatitis dominated by dermo-epidermal infiltrates of CD3-positive lymphocytes, an increased number of mast cells and neoangiogenesis.  Both local and systemic up-regulation of pro-inflammatory (IL-12, TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-8) and regulatory (IL-10) cytokines/chemokines was observed, mainly during the later stages of disease development. The results obtained in this study further confirm the central role of VEGF over-expression in the development of psoriatic-like dermatitis. Similarly to what is reported for human psoriasis, both the local and systemic immunologic profiles observed in K14-VEGF  transgenic mice suggest that a combined Th1 and Th17 response may be implicated in lesion development. The identification of three progressive stages of disease, each with peculiar clinicopathological features, renders the K14-VEGF transgenic  mouse a valuable model to study novel immunotherapies for psoriasis."

To further investigate the role of IL-17A, ears of mice were injected with rmIL-23. Investigators blinded to treatment conditions and mouse genotypes measured ear swelling, epidermal thickness, and cytokine expression. In wild-type (WT) mice, rmIL-23 induced ear swelling (p < 0.001, all  p values versus saline), epidermal hyperplasia by histology (p < 0.001) and confocal microscopy (p < 0.004), and expression of both IL-17A and IL-22. As expected, rmIL-23 injections into IL-22(-/-) mice resulted in relatively little ear swelling (p < 0.09) and epidermal hyperplasia (p < 0.51 by histology and p <  0.75 by confocal microscopy). Notably, rmIL-23 injections into IL-17A(-/-) mice produced little ear swelling (p < 0.001, versus IL-23-injected WT mice) and epidermal hyperplasia (p < 0.001 by histology and p < 0.005 by confocal microscopy), even though IL-22 was readily induced in these mice. Furthermore, systemic delivery of blocking Abs directed against either IL-22 or IL-17A completely inhibited IL-23-induced epidermal hyperplasia in WT mice. These results demonstrate that IL-17A, like IL-22, is a downstream mediator for IL-23-induced changes in murine skin and that both of these Th17 cytokines are necessary to produce IL-23-mediated skin pathology. IL-17A may represent an attractive therapeutic target in individuals with psoriasis by blocking downstream effects of IL-23."

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By spectral imaging analysis of double-stained skin sections we demonstrated that IL-17 was mainly expressed by mast cells and neutrophils and IL-22 by macrophages and dendritic cells. Only an occasional IL-17(pos), but no IL-22(pos) T cell could be detected in psoriatic skin, whereas neither of these cytokines was expressed by T cells in normal skin. However, examination of in vitro-activated T cells by flow cytometry revealed that substantial percentages of skin-derived CD4 and CD8 T cells were able to produce  IL-17A alone or together with IL-22 (i.e. Th17 and Tc17, respectively) or to produce IL-22 in absence of IL-17A and IFN-γ (i.e. Th22 and Tc22, respectively).  Remarkably, a significant proportional rise in Tc17 and Tc22 cells, but not in Th17 and Th22 cells, was found in T cells isolated from psoriatic versus normal skin. Interestingly, we found IL-22 single-producers in many skin-derived IL-17A(pos) CD4 and CD8 T cell clones, suggesting that in vivo IL-22 single-producers may arise from IL-17A(pos) T cells as well. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The increased presence of Tc17 and Tc22 cells in lesional psoriatic skin suggests that these types of CD8 T cells play a significant role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. As part of the skin-derived IL-17A(pos) CD4 and CD8 T clones developed into IL-22 single-producers, this demonstrates plasticity in their cytokine production profile and suggests a developmental relationship between Th17 and Th22 cells and between Tc17 and Tc22  cells."

Aberrations in the T lymphocyte compartment and dysregulated cytokine production are key features of SLE pathogenesis and disease progression. Recently, the role of the interleukin (IL)-17/IL-23 axis in the pathogenesis of SLE has been reported. IL-23 and IL-23R are essential for expansion of pathogenic IL-17-producing T lymphocytes and have been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of lupus in animal models. METHODS: In this study, the expression of IL-23R and IL-17 in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SLE patients and control subjects were examined by flow cytometry. Twenty-nine SLE patients and 10 control subjects were recruited in this study. Patients were divided into active  and inactive groups based on the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI). As another  disease control population, five psoriatic patients were recruited in this study. RESULTS: Percentages of both IL23R(+) CD4(+) and IL-23R(+) CD8(+) T cell subsets  were significantly higher in freshly isolated PBMCs from both groups of SLE patients compared to control subjects (P = 0.0021 and P = 0.0006, respectively).  In addition, this difference was maintained after ex vivo stimulation with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies (P = 0.007 and P = 0.0019, respectively). When the fold increase in IL-17(+) T cells after ex vivo stimulation for three days was compared between patients and controls, SLE patients exhibited significantly higher increases in CD4(+) IL-17(+) and CD8(+) IL-17(+) T cells, suggesting that PBMCs from SLE patients promoted the expansion of IL-17-producing T cells upon stimulation more vigorously than control PBMCs. These trends were not observed in psoriasis patients. The correlations between IL-23R(+) T cells and IL-17(+) T cells and IL-23R(+) CD8(+) T cells and SLEDAI scores in patients were also found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study confirmed the relevance of the IL-23/IL-17  axis in the pathogenesis of SLE and further highlighted the importance of IL-23R(+) T cell subsets in this autoimmune disease."

TGF-β is required for conversion of naive T cells to Th17 cells, but the mechanisms regulating this process are unknown. Integrin αvβ8 on DCs can activate TGF-β, and this process contributes to the development of induced Tregs. Here, we have now shown that integrin αvβ8 expression on DCs plays a critical role in the differentiation of Th17 cells. Th17 cells were nearly absent in the colons of mice lacking αvβ8 expression on DCs. In addition, these mice and the DCs harvested from them had an impaired ability to convert naive T cells into Th17 cells in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Importantly, mice lacking αvβ8 on DCs showed near-complete protection from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our results therefore suggest that the integrin αvβ8 pathway is biologically important and that αvβ8 expression on DCs could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of Th17-driven autoimmune disease."

In mice engineered to overexpress the angiopoietin receptor Tie2 in KCs, skin spontaneously develops the characteristic clinical, histological and immune cell  phenotypes of psoriasis which can be reversed with either transgene repression or ciclosporin administration, suggesting key roles for both KCs and T cells in mediating the skin disease in this murine model. OBJECTIVES: To determine if antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and macrophages alone are sufficient to sustain psoriasiform inflammation in the KC-Tie2 murine model of psoriasis. METHODS: Clodronate liposomes were intradermally injected into involved dorsal skin of KC-Tie2 or control animals once a week for 6weeks and acanthosis, angiogenesis, immune cell infiltration and cytokine production were quantitated using immunohistochemistry and interactive image analyses, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: Clodronate liposome injection eliminated CD11c+, F4/80+ and CD11b+ cells in the skin and returned CD8+ T-cell numbers to control mouse levels. APC depletion in KC-Tie2 mouse skin resulted in resolution of the acanthotic skin phenotype, decreased dermal angiogenesis, and a return to control mouse levels for interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, IL-23 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression and modest reductions in interferon-γ and IL-17. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a critical role for APCs and myeloid cell-derived IL-23 and TNF-α and underscore the importance of Th1 and Th17 T cells in maintaining the psoriasiform skin phenotype in the KC-Tie2 mouse model."

After engraftment, the  regenerated human skin presents the typical architecture of normal human skin but, in both cases, immunological reconstitution through intradermal injection in the regenerated skin using in vitro-differentiated T1 subpopulations as well as recombinant IL-17 and IL-22 Th17 cytokines, together with removal of the stratum  corneum barrier by a mild abrasive treatment, leads to the rapid conversion of the skin into a bona fide psoriatic phenotype. Major hallmarks of psoriasis were  confirmed by the evaluation of specific epidermal differentiation and proliferation markers as well as the mesenchymal milieu, including angiogenesis and infiltrate. Our bioengineered skin-based system represents a robust platform  to reliably assess the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the complex interdependence between epidermal cells and the immune system. The system may also prove suitable to assess preclinical studies that test the efficacy of novel therapeutic treatments and to predict individual patient response to therapy."

Clinical efficacy of an anti-p40 mAb blocking both IL-12 and IL-23 and disease association with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL23R gene raise  the question of a functional role of IL-23 in psoriasis. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of IL-23 and its receptor in psoriasis and demonstrate its functional importance in a disease-relevant model system. The expression of IL-23 and its receptor was increased in the tissues of patients with psoriasis. Injection of a mAb specifically neutralizing human IL-23 showed IL-23-dependent inhibition of psoriasis development comparable to the use of anti-TNF blockers in a clinically relevant xenotransplant mouse model of psoriasis. Together, our results identify a critical functional role for IL-23 in psoriasis and provide the rationale for new treatment strategies in chronic epithelial inflammatory disorders."

In the present study, we evaluate the clinical involvement by calculating the PASI score and the number of CD4+, CD161+, RORgammat+ and CCR6+ cells before and after a 12-week course with etanercept or acitretin in patients  with moderate-to-severe, plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris. Ten patients were given  etanercept 50 mg twice weekly and 10 patients acitretin 0.4 mg/kg per day, both for 12 weeks. At the baseline and at the end of the treatment PASI was calculated, and skin biopsies were taken to evaluate the expression of CD4, CD161, RORgammat and CCR6 by immunohistochemistry. As controls, 10 patients with  atopic dermatitis (AD) were included in the study. After 12 weeks, PASI was significantly lower than at the baseline for both groups. However, etanercept-treated patients showed lower PASI than acitretin-treated ones. While  CD4+ cell numbers were similar in both diseases, all the other markers, that are  considered more specific for Th17 cells and their precursors, were more expressed in psoriasis than in AD. Furthermore, only etanercept, but not acitretin, was able to significantly reduce CD161+, RORgammat+ and CCR6+ cells in skin lesions of patients with psoriasis. Our study provides further evidence of the role of Th17 pathway in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Furthermore, our findings suggest  that etanercept is able to downregulate the expression of the recently recognized markers of Th17 cells and their precursors CD161, RORgammat and CCR6, while acitretin is not. This activity on the Th17 lineage may contribute to the efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of psoriasis."

This delay is preceded by a reduced inflammation and a polarization of inflammatory cytokines from a Th1- and Th17-dominated profile to a Th2-dominated  profile. Absence of Krt17 also attenuates hyperplasia and inflammation in models  of acute dermatitis.

OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the early effects of adalimumab, a human monoclonal anti-TNFα antibody, on the expression of interleukins in psoriatic skin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsies from patients with psoriasis were examined before  and after the start of adalimumab therapy. mRNA expression of cytokines were measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. p38 MAPK and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were analysed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses, and IL-17A and IL-17C were examined with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The increased mRNA level of IL-1β, IL-8, IL-17C and IL-20 in lesional psoriatic skin was already significantly reduced 4 days after the start of adalimumab treatment, i.e. before clinical and histological improvement was detectable. The mRNA expression of the Th17-derived cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F and  IL-22 as well as the dendritic cell product IL-23/IL-12 (p40) were not significantly reduced until 2 weeks after the start of treatment, whereas the mRNA expression of IL-23 (p19) and the Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 were reduced  late in disease resolution. IL-1β, IL-8 and IL-20 are all known to be regulated by p38 MAPK. IL-17C was produced by cultured human keratinocytes and this production was also mediated by a p38 MAPK dependent mechanism. Moreover, the early effects of adalimumab included the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but not STAT3 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that an important mechanism of action of anti-TNFα therapy in psoriasis is a reduction in p38 MAPK phosphorylation and a subsequent decrease in the expression of p38 MAPK regulated genes."

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to understand the role/relation of interleukin (IL)-22, IL-17, IL-23, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in psoriasis vulgaris, addressing their levels and changes before, during and after psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA) and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional and a longitudinal study (n = 34) - before (T0) and at 3 (T3), 6 (T6) and 12 (T12) weeks of NB-UVB and PUVA therapy - were performed; 17 patients started NB-UVB and 17 PUVA, and IL-22, IL-17, IL-23, IL-8, TNF-α and VEGF levels were evaluated. RESULTS: At T0, compared with controls (n = 20), all the parameters were significantly higher in patients, except for TNF-α. Both NB-UVB and PUVA treatment gave, at T3, a significant decrease in TNF-α and IL-23; IL-22 and IL-17 decreased significantly at T6; all parameters and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index decreased significantly at T12. However, in both groups, at T12, VEGF was still significantly higher than control. CONCLUSIONS: Psoriasis seems to be a complex disease in which the cytokine network is disturbed, namely in levels of IL-22, IL-17, IL-23, IL-8, TNF-α and VEGF. NB-UVB and PUVA follow-up studies suggested that the reduction in the IL-23/Th17 axis might be important in the pathogenic mechanisms of psoriasis. Further follow-up studies of patients with psoriasis treated with these and other therapies could be very helpful for the understanding of the disturbance in the cytokine network in psoriasis and indirectly in its pathogenesis."

Core Evid. 2010 Jul 27;5:11-22.","Ustekinumab: an evidence-based review of its effectiveness in the treatment of psoriasis.","INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 2% to 3% of the population worldwide. Discoveries over the past 3 to 5 years have significantly altered our view of psoriasis as primarily a T-cell mediated condition. The most recent research has demonstrated the essential role  of specific cytokines in the development of this complex disease, including TNF-alpha, interleukin-23 (IL-23), and potentially, IL-22. These are all part of  a newly defined autoimmune pathway directed by specialized T cells called Th17 helper T cells. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-12 and IL-23, thus targeting both Th1 and Th17 arms of immunity. It has a promising efficacy and safety profile that not only represents a valuable treatment alternative, but also a continuation in our constantly evolving understanding of this disorder. AIMS: To review the emerging evidence supporting the use of ustekinumab in the management of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. EVIDENCE REVIEW: There is clear evidence that ustekinumab is effective in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Phase III trials (PHOENIX 1 and 2) demonstrated a statistically significant difference between Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 responses achieved by patients receiving ustekinumab, given as a 45 mg or 90 mg subcutaneous injection every 12 weeks, than their placebo counterparts. Treatment with this novel agent resulted in a rapid onset of action, with over 60% of treated patients attaining Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) scores of cleared or minimal by week 12. Quality of life assessments paralleled clinical improvements. CLINICAL POTENTIAL: Ustekinumab is an effective and efficient therapeutic option  for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Although further studies are required to establish ustekinumabs place in the therapy of psoriasis, with its convenient dosing schedule and rapid onset of action, this drug could provide a great addition to the current therapeutic armamentarium available for psoriatic patients."

Some case series have suggested an association. OBJECTIVE: to investigate the potential relationship between psoriasis and MS based on a systematic review of the literature. METHODS: medline, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE searches were performed. RESULTS: T-helper 17 cells are involved in the pathogenesis of both psoriasis and MS. Both conditions have been associated with interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) polymorphisms. Studies have reported psoriasis in 0.41 to 7.7% of individuals with MS. A higher rate of psoriasis compared to controls was noted in a few small MS cohorts, but the number of cases was too small to draw any firm conclusions. In two studies, including a large Canadian study of 5,031 patients with MS, there was no increased prevalence of psoriasis in patients over the control population. Family members of individuals with MS do not appear to be at increased risk for psoriasis in these studies. Psoriasis has developed during treatment for MS, and  MS has developed during treatment for psoriasis. CONCLUSION: although there are some common genetic linkages in psoriasis and MS,  psoriasis does not appear to be more common in patients with MS or their relatives."

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are crucial to maintain homeostasis and provide protection during infection, but are also causally involved in monogenic  auto-inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to investigate the epidermal expression of PRRs and several associated host defense molecules in healthy human skin, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis (AD). Using microarray analysis and real-time quantitative PCR, we found that many of these genes are transcribed in  normal human epidermis. Only a few genes were differentially induced in psoriasis (CLEC7A (dectin-1), Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, and mannose receptor C type 1 (MRC1)) or AD (MRC1, IL1RN, and IL1β) compared with normal epidermis. A remarkably high expression of dectin-1 mRNA was observed in psoriatic epidermis and this was corroborated by immunohistochemistry. In cultured primary human keratinocytes, dectin-1 expression was induced by IFN-γ, IFN-α, and Th17 cytokines. Keratinocytes were unresponsive, however, to dectin-1 ligands such as  β-glucan or heat-killed Candida albicans, nor did we observe synergy with TLR2/TLR5 ligands. In conclusion, upregulation of dectin-1 in psoriatic lesions seems to be under control of psoriasis-associated cytokines. Its role in the biology of skin inflammation and infection remains to be explored."

T-cells, with a predominance of CD4+ lymphocytes, are the most significant lymphocytes in the tissues; in contrast, this ratio is reversed in the epidermis, synovial fluid compartment, and at the enthesis, where CD8+ T-cells are more common. This differential tropism of CD8+ T-cell suggests that the CD8+ T-cells may be driving the immune response in the joint and skin. This is supported by an association with MHC class I. The cytokine network in the psoriatic skin and synovium is dominated by  monocyte and T-cell-derived cytokines: IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-10, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. In PsA synovium, higher levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-10 have been detected than in psoriatic skin. An analysis of T-cell receptor beta-chain variable (TCRbetaV) gene repertoires revealed common expansions in both skin and  synovial inflammatory sites, suggesting an important role for cognate T-cell responses in the pathogenesis of PsA and that the inciting antigen may be identical or homologous between the afflicted skin and synovium. Traditionally, T-cells have been classified as T helper 1 (Th1) or Th2 cells by production of defining cytokines, IFN-gamma and IL-4, respectively. Recently, a new type of T-cell, Th17, has been linked to autoimmune inflammation. T-helper 17 (Th17) cells are a unique effector CD4+ T-cell subset characterized by the production of interleukin (IL)-17. Murine diseases that were previously considered to be pure Th1-mediated responses have been shown to contain mixed populations of Th1 and Th17 cells. Also, in humans, a critical immunoregulatory role of Th-17 cells in infectious and autoimmune diseases has been identified. It has been postulated that IL-17 may be important in psoriasis. Our initial observations demonstrate that IL-17 and its receptor system are important for PsA also. In in vivo and in  vitro studies we have demonstrated that IL-17/IL-17R are enriched in skin, synovial tissue, and synovial fluid of psoriatic arthritis patients and Th17 cells are functionally significant in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Here we will share our experience of the SCID mouse model of psoriasis in respect to its use in investigating psoriatic diseases and development of immune-based drugs for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases."

METHODS: Th17 cells were analyzed in well-defined homogeneous cohorts of patients with the prototypical autoimmune arthritides rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), grouped according to patients who had very early active RA (n = 36; mean disease duration 2.8 months, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints 5.0) and those who had very early active PsA (n = 20; mean disease duration 2.3 months), none of whom had received treatment with glucocorticoids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, as well as patients with established RA (n = 21; mean disease duration 68 months) who were considered either responders or nonresponders to therapy. Groups of healthy individuals and patients with osteoarthritis (a noninflammatory arthritis) were used as control cohorts. Expression of T lineage-specific transcription factors (RORC, T-bet, GATA-3, and  FoxP3) and the response of CD4 T cells to Th17 cell-inducing conditions were analyzed in vitro. RESULTS: The frequencies of Th17 cells and levels of interleukin-17 strongly correlated with systemic disease activity at both the onset and the progression of RA or PsA. The values were reduced to control levels in patients with treatment-controlled disease activity. Th17 cells were enriched in the joints, and increased frequencies of synovial Th17 cells expressed CCR4 and CCR6, indicative of selective migration of Th17 cells to the joints. The intrinsically  elevated expression of RORC, accompanied by biased Th17 cell development, and the resistance of Th17 cells to a natural cytokine antagonist in patients with RA and patients with PsA were suggestive of the underlying molecular mechanisms of uncontrolled Th17 activity in these patients. CONCLUSION: Th17 cells play an important role in inflammation in human autoimmune arthritides, both at the onset and in established disease."

We used immunohistochemistry and double-label immunofluorescence to characterize  CD163(+) macrophages in psoriasis. Dermal macrophages were increased in psoriasis compared with normal skin and were identified by CD163, RFD7, CD68, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), stabilin-1, and macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO). CD163(+) macrophages expressed C-lectins CD206/macrophage mannose receptor and CD209/DC-SIGN, as well as costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40. They did not express mature dendritic cell (DC) markers CD208/DC-lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein, CD205/DEC205, or CD83. Microarray analysis of in vitro-derived macrophages treated with IFN-γ showed that many of the genes upregulated in macrophages were found in psoriasis, including STAT1, CXCL9, Mx1, and HLA-DR. CD163(+) macrophages produced inflammatory molecules IL-23p19 and IL-12/23p40 as well as tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These data show that CD163 is a superior marker of macrophages, and identifies a subpopulation of classically activated macrophages in psoriasis. We conclude that macrophages are likely to contribute to the pathogenic inflammation in psoriasis, a prototypical T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 disease, by releasing key inflammatory products."

En route activated DCs encounter cells of the tissue microenvironment, such as fibroblasts. Because we have shown that DCs interact with fibroblasts during immune responses, we studied the impact of skin fibroblasts on human monocyte-derived DC function and subsequent human T-cell (TC) differentiation. We show that fibroblasts support interleukin-23 (IL-23) secretion from DCs preactivated by lipopolysaccharide (DC(act)) compared with lipopolysaccharide-activated DCs alone. The underlying complex feedback-loop mechanism involves IL-1β/tumor necrosis factor-α (from DC(act)), which stimulate fibroblasts prostaglandin E(2) production. Prostaglandin E(2), in turn, acts on DC(act) and increases their IL-23 release. Furthermore, fibroblast-stimulated DC(act) are far superior to DC(act) alone, in  promoting the expansion of Th17 cells in a Cox-2-, IL-23-dependent manner. Using  CD4(+)CD45RO(+) memory TCs and CD4(+)CD45RA(+) naive TCs, we showed that fibroblasts induce a phenotype of DC(act) that promotes the expansion of Th17 cells. Moreover, in psoriasis, a prototypic immune response in which the importance of IL-23/Th17 is known, high expression of Cox-2 in fibroblasts was observed. In conclusion, skin fibroblasts are involved in regulation of IL-23 production in DCs and, as a result, of Th17 expansion."

We observed that impaired function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and increased cytokine levels of the IL-23/Th17 pathway were responsible  for the psoriatic phenotype in this mouse model. Treatment of K5.hTGF-beta1 transgenic mice with PUVA suppressed the IL-23/Th17 pathway, Th1 milieu, as well  as transcription factors STAT3 and orphan nuclear receptor RORgammat. PUVA induced the Th2 pathway and IL-10-producing CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs with disease-suppressive activity that was abolished by anti-CTLA4 mAb treatment. These findings were paralleled by macroscopic and microscopic clearance of the diseased murine skin. Anti-IL-17 mAb treatment also diminished the psoriatic phenotype of the mice. This indicated that both induced Tregs involving CTLA4 signaling and inhibition of the IL-23/Th17 axis are central for the therapeutic action of PUVA."

In particular, various studies showed a correlation between psoriasis and major CV events (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke), while others investigated subclinical changes of blood vessels, such as intima-media thickness increase, arterial stiffness and coronary artery calcification. A series of different mechanisms, like traditional CV risk or iatrogenic risk factors, inflammation, hemostasis dysregulation, hyperhomocysteinemia, and shared genetic susceptibility, are thought to underlie this epidemiological association.

IL-23-driven inflammation has primarily been linked to the actions of T-helper type 17 (TH17) cells. Somewhat overlooked, IL-23 also has inflammatory effects on innate immune cells and can drive T-cell-independent colitis. However, the downstream cellular and molecular pathways involved in this innate intestinal inflammatory response are poorly characterized. Here we show that bacteria-driven innate colitis is associated with an increased production of IL-17 and interferon-gamma in the colon. Stimulation of colonic leukocytes with IL-23 induced the production of IL-17 and  interferon-gamma exclusively by innate lymphoid cells expressing Thy1, stem cell  antigen 1 (SCA-1), retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat and IL-23R, and these cells markedly accumulated in the inflamed colon. IL-23-responsive innate intestinal cells are also a feature of T-cell-dependent models of colitis. The transcription factor ROR-gammat, which controls IL-23R expression, has a functional role, because Rag-/-Rorc-/- mice failed to develop innate colitis. Last, depletion of Thy1+ innate lymphoid cells completely abrogated acute and chronic innate colitis. These results identify a previously unrecognized IL-23-responsive innate lymphoid population that mediates intestinal immune pathology and may therefore represent a target in inflammatory bowel disease."

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using immunohistochemistry, we define the distribution of PPARbeta/delta in the skin lesions of psoriasis. By expression profiling, we confirm that PPARbeta/delta is overexpressed in the vast majority of psoriasis patients. We further establish a transgenic model allowing inducible activation of PPARbeta/delta in murine epidermis mimicking its distribution in psoriasis lesions. Upon activation of PPARbeta/delta, transgenic mice sustain an  inflammatory skin disease strikingly similar to psoriasis, featuring hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, dendritic cell accumulation, and endothelial activation. Development of this phenotype requires the activation of the Th17 subset of T cells, shown previously to be central to psoriasis. Moreover, gene dysregulation in the transgenic mice is highly similar to that in psoriasis. Key  transcriptional programs activated in psoriasis, including IL1-related signalling and cholesterol biosynthesis, are replicated in the mouse model, suggesting that  PPARbeta/delta regulates these transcriptional changes in psoriasis. Finally, we  identify phosphorylation of STAT3 as a novel pathway activated by PPARbeta/delta  and show that inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation blocks disease development. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of PPARbeta/delta in the epidermis is sufficient to trigger inflammatory changes, immune activation, and signalling, and gene dysregulation characteristic of psoriasis."

It is widely used in East Asia for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, nephritis, Bechects disease, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. However, its immunological mechanisms are poorly understood. IL-12 and IL-23 are closely related heterodimeric cytokines that share the common subunit p40. They are produced by APCs and are key factors in the generation and effector functions of Th1 and Th17 cells, respectively. They have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune disorders. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism whereby triptolide inhibits the expression of the p40 gene in APCs. We demonstrate that triptolide does so at the transcriptional level in part through  targeting CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha), which directly interacts with the p40 promoter and inhibits its transcription in inflammatory macrophages. Triptolide can activate the transcription of C/EBPalpha, and phosphorylation of Ser21 and Thr222/226 critical for C/EBPalpha inhibition of p40. Further, activation of C/EBPalpha by triptolide is dependent on upstream kinases ERK1/2 and Akt-GSK3beta. This study provides mechanistic insights into the immunomodulatory capacity of triptolide and has strong implications for its therapeutic applications in autoimmune diseases."

EDA+ FN refers to an alternatively spliced isoform of FN with an additional domain known as extra domain A. EDA+ FN has two  important properties pertinent to psoriasis lesions: it stimulates keratinocyte hyperproliferation, and, through stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, stimulates production of proinflammatory cytokines. EDA+ FN production induced by TGF-beta stimulation can be maintained in psoriasis lesions via two main feedback loops. Firstly, EDA+ FN stimulates proliferation of keratinocytes, which, in an autocrine fashion, will release more EDA+ FN. Secondly, EDA+ FN stimulates TLR4 expressed by antigen-presenting cells resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-12. The resultant promotion of cutaneous inflammation results in the recruitment of Th1 cells, which also produce EDA+ FN. We propose that these FN loops contribute to the maintenance and progression of psoriatic lesions. Finally, although the association between psoriasis and heart/thrombotic disease remains unclear one plausible link may be the promotion of atherosclerosis and thrombotic heart disease by EDA+ FN."

IL-6 exhibits multiple biologic functions, such as regulation of immunological responses including those in psoriatic reactions. Therefore, we examined the production of IL-6 protein in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) stimulated by IL-17F, TNF-alpha, IL-17A, and IL-17A in combination with TNF-alpha, and PBS control. We then examined the expression of IL-6 mRNA in mouse skin after intradermal injection of IL-17F. Finally, IL-17F expression in skin biopsy specimens from psoriasis patients was examined by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that IL-17F induced production of IL-6 in NHEKs in a time-dependent manner. This could be attenuated by chimeric inhibitor blocking the IL-17 receptor. The amounts of IL-6 stimulated by IL-17F were much higher than those stimulated by TNF-alpha or IL-17A. IL-6 was also significantly upregulated via synergistic stimulation with IL-17A plus TNF-alpha. The expression of IL-6 mRNA 24 h after IL-17F injection in the mouse skin was 3.2-fold higher than that in the control group. Immunohistochemistry of inflammatory cells in the dermis demonstrated a large number of CD4(+) T cells showing IL-17F positivity in psoriatic skin lesions, but few or none in non-lesional psoriatic skin. Our results indicate that IL-17F produced by CD4(+)  T cells causes the inflammation in psoriasis partly through induction of IL-6 in  keratinocytes."

Specifically, the proinflammatory IL-17A-producing Th17 subset is implicated in protection against fungi at epithelial surfaces. In autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED, or autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome 1), CMC is often the first sign, but the underlying immunodeficiency is a long-standing puzzle. In contrast, the subsequent endocrine features are clearly autoimmune, resulting from defects in thymic self-tolerance induction caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE). We report severely reduced IL-17F and IL-22 responses to both Candida albicans antigens and polyclonal stimulation in APECED patients with CMC. Surprisingly, these reductions are strongly associated with neutralizing autoantibodies to IL-17F and IL-22, whereas responses were normal and autoantibodies infrequent in APECED patients without CMC. Our multicenter survey  revealed neutralizing autoantibodies against IL-17A (41%), IL-17F (75%), and/ or  IL-22 (91%) in >150 APECED patients, especially those with CMC. We independently  found autoantibodies against these Th17-produced cytokines in rare thymoma patients with CMC. The autoantibodies preceded the CMC in all informative cases.  We conclude that IL-22 and IL-17F are key natural defenders against CMC and that  the immunodeficiency underlying CMC in both patient groups has an autoimmune basis."

This study was undertaken to explore the mechanisms underlying TNFalpha blockade-induced exacerbation of skin inflammation in murine psoriasis-like skin disease. METHODS: Skin inflammation was induced in BALB/c scid/scid mice after they received CD4+CD45RB(high)CD25- (naive CD4) T cells from donor mice. These mice were treated with either anti-interleukin-12 (anti-IL-12)/23p40 antibody or murine TNFRII-Fc fusion protein and were examined for signs of disease, including histologic features, various cytokine levels in the serum, and cytokine or FoxP3  transcripts in the affected skin and draining lymph node (LN) cells. In a separate study, naive CD4+ T cells were differentiated into Th1 or Th17 lineages  with anti-CD3/28 magnetic beads and appropriate cytokines in the presence or absence of TNFalpha. Cytokine gene expression from these differentiated cells was also determined. RESULTS: Neutralization of TNFalpha exacerbated skin inflammation and markedly enhanced the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17, IL-21, and IL-22 but suppressed FoxP3 expression in the skin and reduced the number of FoxP3-positive Treg cells in the draining LNs. TNFalpha also demonstrated a divergent role during priming and reactivation of naive T cells. CONCLUSION: These results reveal a novel immunoregulatory role of TNFalpha on Th17 and Treg cells in some individuals, which may account for the exacerbation of skin inflammation in some patients who receive anti-TNF treatments."

The purpose of this review is to discuss the major findings of these studies, and the answers they provide and questions they raise about the pathogenesis of this common condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Five genes/genetic regions have now definitively been associated with AS [the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), IL23R, ERAP1, 2p15 and 21q22]. Strong evidence to support association with the disease has been demonstrated for the genes IL1R2, ANTXR2, TNFSF15, TNFR1 and a region on chromosome 16q including the gene TRADD. There is an overrepresentation of genes  involved in Th17 lymphocyte differentiation/activation among genes associated with AS and the related diseases inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis, pointing strongly to this pathway as playing a major causative role in the disease. Increasing information about differential association of HLA-B27 subtypes with disease suggests a hierarchy of strength of association of those alleles with AS, providing a useful test as to the validity of different potential mechanisms of association of HLA-B27 with AS. The mechanism underlying  the association of the gene deserts, 2p15 and 21q22, suggests the involvement of  noncoding RNA in AS etiopathogenesis. SUMMARY: The increasing list of genes identified as being definitely involved in  AS provides a useful platform for hypothesis-driven research in the field, providing a potential alternative route to determining the underlying mechanisms  involved in the disease to research focusing on HLA-B27 alone."

IL-12 and IL-23 are heterodimers made up of a common p40 subunit complexed to unique p35 (IL-12) or p19 (IL-23) subunits. Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds the p40 subunit of IL-12/23.

Although it is well known that uncontrolled keratinocyte proliferation is largely driven by proinflammatory cytokines from the immunocytes, the functional role of keratinocytes in the regulation of immunocytes is poorly understood. Recently, we found that tripartite motif-containing protein 32 (Trim32), an E3-ubiquitin ligase, is elevated in the  epidermal lesions of human psoriasis. We previously showed that Trim32 binds to the protein inhibitor of activated STAT-Y (Piasy) and mediates its degradation through ubiquitination. Interestingly, the Piasy gene is localized in the PSORS6  susceptibility locus on chromosome 19p13, and Piasy negatively regulates the activities of several transcription factors, including NF-kappaB, STAT, and SMADs, that are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In this study, we show that Trim32 activates, and Piasy inhibits, keratinocyte production of CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), a psoriatic chemokine essential for recruitment of DCs and T helper (Th)17 cells to the skin. Further, Trim32/Piasy regulation of CCL20 is mediated through Piasy interaction with the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-kappaB. As CCL20 is activated by Th17 cytokines, the upregulation of CCL20 production by Trim32 provides a positive feedback loop of CCL20 and Th17 activation in the self-perpetuating cycle of psoriasis."

Currently,  IL-17 and Th17 cells are implicated in many autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Such conclusions were initially drawn from observations in animal models of autoimmune diseases, and accumulating data from clinical research also  support the involvement of IL-17 in human diseases as well. Reagents targeting Th17-related molecules have been under clinical investigation for some diseases but have not always been effective in controlling disease activity. Consistent with this, it has become evident that there are substantial differences in the development of Th17 cells and in the way they function in autoimmune diseases between humans and experimental animals. Thus, further investigation is needed before we can draw any conclusions about the importance of IL-17 and Th17 cells in human autoimmune diseases."

Although IL-22 was initially considered a Th17 cytokine, increasing evidence suggests that T helper cells can produce IL-22 even without IL-17 expression. In addition, we have shown the existence of this unique IL-22-producing T cell in normal skin and in the skin of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis patients. In the present study, we investigated the ability of cutaneous resident dendritic cells (DCs) to differentiate IL-22-producing cells.  Using FACS, we isolated Langerhans cells (LCs; HLA-DR(+)CD207(+) cells) and dermal DCs (HLA-DR(hi)CD11c(+)BDCA-1(+) cells) from normal human epidermis and dermis, respectively. Both LCs and dermal DCs significantly induced IL-22-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from peripheral blood T cells and naive CD4(+) T cells in mixed leukocyte reactions. LCs were more powerful in the induction of IL-22-producing cells than dermal DCs. Moreover, in vitro-generated  LC-type DCs induced IL-22-producing cells more efficiently than monocyte-derived  DCs. The induced IL-22 production was more correlated with IFN-gamma than IL-17.  Surprisingly, the majority of IL-22-producing cells induced by LCs and dermal DCs lacked the expression of IL-17, IFN-gamma, and IL-4. Thus, LCs and dermal DCs preferentially induced helper T cells to produce only IL-22, possibly Th22 cells. Our data indicate that cutaneous DCs, especially LCs, may control the generation of distinct IL-22 producing Th22 cells infiltrating into the skin."

In analogy to the Th17 subset, cells with this cytokine profile have been named the Th22 subset. Th22 clones derived from patients with psoriasis were stable in culture and exhibited a transcriptome profile clearly separate from those of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells; it included genes encoding proteins involved in tissue remodeling, such as FGFs, and chemokines involved in angiogenesis and fibrosis. Primary human keratinocytes exposed to Th22 supernatants expressed a transcriptome response profile that included genes involved in innate immune pathways and the induction and modulation of adaptive immunity. These proinflammatory Th22 responses were synergistically dependent on IL-22 and TNF-alpha. Furthermore, Th22 supernatants  enhanced wound healing in an in vitro injury model, which was exclusively dependent on IL-22. In conclusion, the human Th22 subset may represent a separate T cell subset with a distinct identity with respect to gene expression and function, present within the epidermal layer in inflammatory skin diseases. Future strategies directed against the Th22 subset may be of value in chronic inflammatory skin disorders."

Recent studies demonstrated that IL-20 and IL-22, cytokines produced by keratinocytes and T cells, respectively, both inhibit keratinocyte terminal differentiation and induce psoriasis-like epidermis alterations. Here, we investigated the relationship between these mediators. Although IL-20 was not able to regulate IL-22 production, IL-22 induced IL-20 mRNA and protein in human keratinocytes. However, IL-22 had only a  minimal effect, if any, on IL-19 and IL-26. Cutaneous IL-20 was also elevated in  mice following IL-22 application. Accordingly, some of IL-22s effects on differentiation-regulating genes were partially mediated by an endogenous, secreted protein and attenuated by anti-IL-20 Ab. Like IL-22, IL-17A and TNF-alpha induced IL-20 in keratinocytes, whereas IFN-gamma and IL-20 itself did  not. Furthermore, IL-17A and TNF-alpha individually strengthened the IL-22-induced IL-20 production. In lesional skin of psoriasis patients, highly elevated IL-20 levels strongly correlated with IL-22, and to a lesser extent, with IL-17A and TNF-alpha. As previously shown for IL-22, IL-20 blood levels correlated with the disease severity, although with a lower significance. This study demonstrates that a T-cell mediator induces a tissue cell mediator with similar effects to its own and therefore suggests the existence of a novel type of pathogenetic cascade."

These cytokines collectively contribute to the functional outcome of the Th response. IL-22 plays a critical role in some Th17-associated diseases, such as psoriasis, but its relationship to IL-17 remains controversial. Here, we used a systematic multiparametric analysis  of Th-17-associated cytokines, which revealed the unexpected finding that the regulation pattern of IL-22 was most closely related to interferon-gamma, the prototypical Th1 cytokine, and not to IL-17. To explain this observation, we systematically tested the role of Th1- and Th17-inducing cytokines. We could show that IL-12 and IL-23 induced high levels of IL-22 but no IL-17. Conversely, transforming growth factor-beta inhibited IL-22 production but promoted IL-17. Thus, IL-17 and IL-22 are differentially regulated during cytokine-induced Th cell differentiation. This has important implications for the understanding and pharmacologic manipulation of Th17-associated pathologies."

Recent studies have shown a role for these cells in both normal immunity and in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. Regulatory T cells protect against  autoimmune reactions to self antigens and assist in the resolution of cutaneous inflammation. However, they can also shield tumors from immune detection, allow latent infections to persist and can dysfunction under the conditions present in  inflammatory skin diseases. Th17 T cells protect organisms against extracellular  pathogens but also have a key role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Evidence suggests that effector memory T cells produced during immune reactions survive and persist long term within the skin, providing local and rapid protection against pathogen reexposure. This review summarizes the current understanding of  how skin-resident T cells contribute to normal and aberrant immunity in the skin."

IL-23 is expressed in psoriatic skin, and IL-23 injection produces IL-22-dependent psoriasiform changes in mouse skin. Th17 cells produce IL-22 and display CCR6, the CCL20 receptor; CCR6+ T cells and CCL20 are abundant in psoriatic skin. We investigated a possible role for CCR6 in recruiting Th17 cells and producing psoriasiform pathology by injecting IL-23 into the skin of WT and Ccr6-/- mice. Unlike for WT  mice, IL-23-injected ears of Ccr6-/- mice showed neither substantial epidermal/dermal changes nor increased Il22 mRNA expression. However, injection of IL-22 yielded equivalent psoriasiform changes in WT and Ccr6-/- mice. Surprisingly, IL-23-injected ears of WT and Ccr6-/- mice contained similar numbers of Th cells able to make IL-17A and/or IL-22. Furthermore, in ears of Rag1-/- mice, IL-23 initially induced skin changes and levels of Il22 mRNA that were indistinguishable from WT mice, revealing at least one non-T cell source for IL-22. We conclude that CCR6 is essential in a model of IL-23-induced, IL-22-mediated dermatitis, which develops in sequential T cell-independent and T  cell-dependent phases. These findings reveal an expanded role for CCR6 in IL-23-related responses and identify CCR6 as a potential therapeutic target in psoriasis."

This is based on a constellation of different factors, including abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance, and is a strong predictor of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. People with moderate to severe psoriasis have more risk for  cardiac disease, presumably due to the inflammatory nature of psoriasis, causing  inflammatory changes in coronary arteries. The strong association between psoriasis and obesity potentially makes psoriasis an important healthcare issue.  Since cardiovascular risk factors are higher in psoriatic patients, dermatologists treating moderate to severe psoriasis should screen for their presence, thus approaching psoriasis as a potential multisystem disorder."

While the Th1 T cell response has long been considered  the sole immune agent in the pathomechanisms of psoriasis, recently, the role of  IL-23-driven Th17 has been shown to be predominant. Subsequently, only effector memory T cells expressing alpha1beta1 integrin migrate into the epidermis, and psoriasis development is inhibited by blocking this integrin. Psoriatic epidermis contains high amounts of antimicrobial peptides, which have been shown to be a key mediator of plasmocytoid dendritic cell activation in psoriasis. The keratinocyte component has recently regained the central stage, as the abrogation of JunB/activator protein 1 in mouse keratinocytes induces development of psoriasiform lesions in T cell deficient mice. Moreover, inhibition of nerve growth factor and its receptor in keratinocytes strikingly improves psoriatic lesions."

The proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, which signals through Stat3, allows escape of Tmem/eff cells from Treg-mediated suppression in a murine system. We show here that IL-6 protein is markedly elevated and most highly expressed by CD31(+) endothelial cells and CD11c(+) dermal dendritic cells (DCs) in lesional psoriatic skin. We hypothesized that exposure to high IL-6 in lesional tissue may lead to the dampened Treg function observed in psoriasis patients. Indeed, we found that  IL-6, but not other Stat3-activating cytokines, was necessary and sufficient to reverse human T cell suppression by Treg in an in vitro model using activated DCs as a source of IL-6. IL-6Ralpha and gp130 expression was significantly elevated in psoriatic effector T cells compared with normal controls. Overall, IL-6Ralpha  expression on Treg exceeded that of effector T cells, and both populations phosphorylated Stat3 in response to IL-6. Phosphorylation of Stat3 in T cells contributes to Th17 differentiation and we identify cells within lesional tissue  that coexpress CD3, IL-17, and IL-6, indicating that Th17 cells are present in vivo within the psoriatic Tmem/eff population and contribute to IL-6-mediated resistance to Treg suppression. Taken together, T lymphocytes trafficking into lesional psoriatic skin encounter high IL-6 from endothelial cells, DCs, and Th17 cells, enabling cutaneous T cell escape from Treg suppression and Th17 participation in inflammation. Targeting IL-6 signaling pathways in psoriasis may rebalance Treg/T effector activity and ameliorate disease."

In this article, we review the differential regulation of inflammation in different tissues with a major emphasis on enhancement of neuroinflammation by local production of IL-17 in the brain. By understanding the role of pathogenic factors in the induction of autoimmune diseases by Th17 cells, CAM practitioners will be able to design CAM therapies targeting Th17 and associated cytokine activities and signaling pathways to repair the intestinal and blood-brain barriers for their patients with autoimmunities, in particular, those with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration."

Formation of new blood vessels starts with early psoriatic changes and disappears with disease clearance. Several angiogenic mediators like vascular endothelial growth factor,  hypoxia-inducible factors, angiopoietins and pro-angiogenic cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-17, are up-regulated in psoriasis development.

The existence of variant forms of OPN as a secreted (sOPN) and intracellular (iOPN) protein and its modification through post-translational modification and proteolytic cleavage explain its broad range of functions. There is increasing knowledge which receptors OPN isoforms can bind to and which signaling pathways are activated to mediate different OPN functions. sOPN interacts with integrins and CD44, mediates cell adhesion, migration and tumor invasion, and has T helper  1 (Th1) cytokine functions and anti-apoptotic effects. iOPN has been described to regulate macrophage migration and interferon-alpha secretion in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Both sOPN and iOPN, through complex functions for different dendritic cell subsets, participate in the regulation of Th cell lineages, among  them Th17 cells. For skin disease, OPN from immune cells and tumor cells is of pathophysiological relevance. OPN is secreted in autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus, and influences inflammation of immediate and delayed type allergies and granuloma formation. We describe that OPN is overexpressed in psoriasis and propose a model to study OPN function in psoriatic inflammation. Through cytokine functions, OPN supports immune responses against Mycobacteria and viruses such as herpes simplex virus. OPN is also implicated in skin tumor progression. Overexpression of OPN influences invasion and metastasis of melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma cells, and OPN expression in melanoma is a possible prognostic marker. As OPN protein preparations and anti-OPN antibodies may be available in the near future, in-depth knowledge of OPN functions may open new therapeutic approaches for skin diseases."

RECENT FINDINGS: Convincing evidence has been reported for the existence of further non-B27 MHC genes involved in AS. Strong, replicated association has been reported with IL23R and ERAP1 and AS. The IL23R finding strongly implicates the TH17 lymphocyte system in AS aetiopathogenesis. Suggestive evidence of a role for KIR gene polymorphism in AS exists, but definitive findings are awaited.

However, little is known about the potential role of IL-17-producing CD8+ T cells, which are also present at the psoriatic plaque. We have addressed the functional characterization of this CD8+ subtype of T lymphocytes from psoriasis patients. Our results show that CD8+IL-17+ cells from psoriasis-inflamed skin tissue produce TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma (Th1-related cytokines) as well as IL-17, IL-21,  and IL-22 (Th17-related cytokines) efficiently. A significant up-regulation of the RORC transcription factor is also observed. These cells are refractory to Tregs but show a proliferative response to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation that is enhanced by IL-12 and IL-15. Blocking of TNF-alpha activity inhibits TCR-mediated activation and IL-17 production. CD8+IL-17+ T cells are cytotoxic cells that display TCR/CD3-mediated cytotoxic abilities to kill target cells. Thus, CD8+IL-17+ T cells share some key features with Th17 cells and exhibit remarkable differential abilities attributable to the CD8+ lineage of T lymphocytes, adding  new insights into the functional resources of IL-17-producing cells from human epidermis that could be of potential interest to our understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis."

An upregulated TH17/IL-23 pathway was demonstrated in psoriasis. Although potential involvement of TH17 T cells in AD was suggested during acute disease, the role of these cells in chronic AD remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in IL-23/TH17 signal between these diseases and establish relative frequencies of T-cell subsets in AD. METHODS: Skin biopsies and peripheral blood were collected from patients with chronic AD (n = 12) and psoriasis (n = 13). Relative frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets within these 2 compartments were examined by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In peripheral blood, no significant difference was found in percentages  of different T-cell subsets between these diseases. In contrast, psoriatic skin had significantly increased frequencies of TH1 and TH17 T cells compared with AD, whereas TH2 T cells were significantly elevated in AD. Distinct IL-22-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations were significantly increased in AD skin compared with psoriasis. IL-22+CD8+ T-cell frequency correlated with AD disease severity. CONCLUSION: Our data established that T cells could independently express IL-22 even with low expression levels of IL-17. This argues for a functional specialization of T cells such that T17 and T22 T-cells may drive different features of epidermal pathology in inflammatory skin diseases, including induction of antimicrobial peptides for T17 T cells and epidermal hyperplasia for T22 T-cells. Given the clinical correlation with disease severity, further  characterization of T22 T cells is warranted, and may have future therapeutic implications."

Although TH1 and TH2 cells are similar in mice and humans, TH17 cells differ in several ways. The differentiation of mouse TH17 cells requires transforming growth factor beta and IL-6, whereas human naive T cells can develop into TH17 cells in the presence of IL-1beta and IL-23 alone, transforming growth  factor beta having an indirect role in their development via the selective inhibition of TH1 cell expansion. in both mice and humans, a late developmental plasticity of TH17 cells towards the TH1 lineage has been shown. Mainly based on  mouse gene knockout studies, TH17 lymphocytes have been found to have a pathogenic role in several autoimmune disorders; however, whether human autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis, are prevalently TH1-mediated or TH17-mediated, is still unclear. research suggests that both TH1 and TH17 cells are involved in RA pathogenesis, raising the possibility that interventions that target both the IL-23-IL-17 (TH17) and the IL-12-interferon gamma (TH1) axes might be successful future therapeutic approaches for RA."

We recently found that apigenin, a non-mutagenic dietary flavonoid, can sensitize recurrently activated, normal human T cells to apoptosis by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kappaB)-regulated Bcl-xL, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) expression. Because sustained immune activation and hyperexpression of COX-2 and c-FLIP contribute to lupus, we treated SNF1 mice that spontaneously develop human lupus-like disease with apigenin. METHODS: SNF1 mice with established lupus-like disease were injected with 20 mg/kg of apigenin daily and then monitored for development of severe nephritis. Histopathologic changes in kidneys, IgG autoantibodies to nuclear autoantigens in serum and in cultures of splenocytes, along with nucleosome-specific T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 responses, COX-2 expression, and apoptosis of lupus immune cells were analyzed after apigenin treatment. RESULTS: Apigenin in culture suppressed responses of Th1 and Th17 cells to major  lupus autoantigen (nucleosomes) up to 98% and 92%, respectively, and inhibited the ability of lupus B cells to produce IgG class-switched anti-nuclear autoantibodies helped by these Th cells in presence of nucleosomes by up to 82%.  Apigenin therapy of SNF1 mice with established lupus suppressed serum levels of pathogenic autoantibodies to nuclear antigens up to 97% and markedly delayed development of severe glomerulonephritis. Apigenin downregulated COX-2 expression in lupus T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and caused their apoptosis. Autoantigen presentation and Th17-inducing cytokine production by dendritic cells were more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of apigenin in culture, as evident at 0.3 to 3 muM, compared with concentrations (10 to 100 microM) required for inducing apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Apigenin inhibits autoantigen-presenting and stimulatory functions of APCs necessary for the activation and expansion of autoreactive Th1 and Th17 cells and B cells in lupus. Apigenin also causes apoptosis of hyperactive lupus APCs and T and B cells, probably by inhibiting expression of NF-kappaB-regulated  anti-apoptotic molecules, especially COX-2 and c-FLIP, which are persistently hyperexpressed by lupus immune cells. Increasing the bioavailability of dietary plant-derived COX-2 and NF-kappaB inhibitors, such as apigenin, could be valuable for suppressing inflammation in lupus and other Th17-mediated diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and psoriasis and in prevention of inflammation-based tumors overexpressing COX-2 (colon, breast)."

Daily application of IMQ on mouse back  skin induced inflamed scaly skin lesions resembling plaque type psoriasis.

The brother displayed mild skin infections and impaired Ig class switching, whereas the sister had more severe symptoms, including immunodeficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial pneumonitis, and psoriasis. Despite normal CD3/CD28-induced proliferation and IL-2 production in vitro, peripheral blood T cells in both patients showed a decreased percentage of CD4 central and effector memory T cells and impaired production of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines upon CD3/CD28 costimulation or PMA/ionophore stimulation. The defective polarization into effector cells was associated with impaired induction of T-bet, GATA3, MAF, and retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear hormone receptor (RORC). Reduced CTLA-4(+)CD45RO(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells and diminished induction of inhibitory cell surface molecules, including CTLA-4, were also observed in the patients. T cell defect was not restricted to CD4 T cells because reduced memory  T cells and impaired IFN-gamma production were also noted in CD8 T cells. Further analysis of the patients demonstrated increased induction of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), lack of IFN-gamma response, and loss of Itch expression upon activation in the female patient, who had autoimmunity.

CCL20 production by PRL was suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides against the AP-1 components c-Fos and c-Jun, whereas that by IL-17 was suppressed by antisense NF-kappaB p50 and p65. CCL20 production induced by PRL plus IL-17 was suppressed by antisense c-Fos, c-Jun, p50, and p65.

However, whether IL-17 plays a role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the serum IL-17 level in patients with SLE and its associations with disease manifestations and activity. Fifty-seven patients with SLE and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited. Serum IL-17 levels were examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistic analyzes were performed by SPSS 10.01. Results show that serum IL-17 levels were significantly elevated in SLE patients  as compared with normal controls. Nevertheless, no associations of serum IL-17 level with clinical and laboratory parameters were found; no significant difference regarding serum IL-17 level between SLE patients with nephritis and those without nephritis was found; no significant difference was found between Less active SLE and More active SLE; Correlation analysis between serum IL-17 levels and SLEDAI showed no association. Taken together, our results indicate increased serum IL-17 levels in SLE patients, suggesting that this cytokine may trigger the inflammatory process in SLE. However, no associations of serum IL-17  level with disease manifestations were found. Therefore, further studies are required to confirm this preliminary data."

This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes  and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17, cells as  well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of  peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR, peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of  PETIR in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory  skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study."

Recent studies in a mouse colitis model indicated that vanin-1 has proinflammatory activity and suggest that pantetheinases are potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases. In a microarray analysis of epidermal gene expression of psoriasis and  atopic dermatitis lesions, we identified vanin-3 as the gene showing the highest  differential expression of all annotated genes that we studied (19-fold upregulation in psoriasis). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis confirmed the microarray data on vanin-3 and showed similar induction of vanin-1, but not of vanin-2, in psoriatic epidermis. Immunohistochemistry showed that vanin-3 is expressed in the differentiated epidermal layers. Using submerged and organotypic keratinocyte cultures, we found that vanin-1 and vanin-3 are induced at the mRNA  and protein level by psoriasis-associated proinflammatory cytokines (Th17/Th1) but not by Th2 cytokines. We hypothesize that increased levels of pantetheinase activity are part of the inflammatory-regenerative epidermal differentiation program, and may contribute to the phenotype observed in psoriasis."

Many of the candidate genes linked to psoriasis are associated with the acquired or innate immune system, which are also important in host defence to invasive streptococcal infections. High rates of positive streptococcal throat swabs among patients with chronic plaque psoriasis suggest that they are efficient at internalizing/carrying beta-haemolytic streptococci. Internalization of streptococci in the throat is dependent upon the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta/fibronectin/alpha 5 beta 1 integrin pathway. The immune cell Th17 and  its related cytokine network are important in mucosal defence, being very effective against extracellular microbes but having little effect on intracellular organisms. The TGF-beta/fibronectin/alpha 5 beta 1 integrin pathway and the Th17 cell network also appear to be operative in psoriasis, animal models of both TGF-beta and alpha 5 beta 1 cutaneous overexpression being associated with characteristic psoriasis lesions. We postulate that some of the genotypic/phenotypic changes in different immunological pathways in psoriasis, including the acquired T-cell response, the innate immune response, the TGF-beta/fibronectin/alpha 5 beta 1 integrin pathway and the Th17 cell system, confer protection against mortality during epidemics of invasive streptococcal infections, heightened efficiency in internalizing and allowing carriage of streptococci as well as predisposition to the development of psoriasis."

Lastly, we showed in mice that subcutaneous injection with recombinant IL-17A, IL-22, or TNF-alpha led to the upregulation of both CCL20 and CCR6 expression in skin as well as cutaneous T-cell infiltration. Taken together, these data show that Th17 cytokines stimulate CCL20 production in vitro and in vivo, and thus provide a potential explanation of how CCR6-positive Th17 cells maintain their continual presence in psoriasis through a positive chemotactic feedback loop."

More recently, a genetic association was discovered between polymorphisms in the gene coding for the IL-23 receptor and spondyloarthritis. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Th17-associated cytokines in spondyloarthritis pathogenesis by measuring their levels in the joints and circulation as well as correlating them with disease activity parameters. METHODS: Paired synovial fluid (SF), serum and synovial biopsies were obtained from 30 non-PsA (psoriatic arthritis) spondyloarthritis, 22 PsA and 22 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. IL-17, IL-23 and CCL20 were measured by ELISA in the SF  and serum of patients and correlated with systemic and local parameters of disease activity. RESULTS: Concentrations of CCL20, a major Th17-attracting chemokine, tended to be higher in the joints of RA than in spondyloarthritis patients. Interestingly, levels of CCL20 were markedly higher in SF as opposed to serum. In addition, there was a remarkable association between the expression of the Th17 cytokine system and the presence of intimal lining layer hyperplasia in RA. Also in the serum, there was a tendency for higher IL-23 levels in RA, which correlated strongly with disease activity parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Th17-related cytokines are expressed in joints of spondyloarthritis  as well as RA patients. IL-23 levels, however, correlate with disease activity parameters in RA only. These results point towards a differential regulation of the Th17 cytokine system in spondyloarthritis compared with RA."

METHODS: Needle arthroscopy of an inflamed knee joint was performed in patients with early untreated BD (n = 8) and PsA (n = 9). Synovial fluid (SF) was collected for cytokines, perforin, and granzyme analysis. Eight synovial biopsies per patient were obtained for immunohistochemical analysis of the cellular infiltrate (T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, B cells, plasma cells, mast cells, and neutrophils), blood vessels as well as expression of perforin and granzyme. The stained slides were evaluated by digital image analysis. RESULTS: The global degree of synovial inflammation was similar in the two types  of arthritis. In the analysis of the innate immune cell infiltration, there was a striking neutrophilic inflammation in BD synovitis whereas PsA displayed significantly higher numbers of cells positive for c-kit, a marker of mast cells. As for lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, but neither CD20+ B cells nor CD138+ plasma cells, were significantly increased in BD versus PsA. Further analysis of the T-lymphocyte population showed no clear shift in CD4/CD8 ratio or Th1/Th2/Th17 profile. The SF levels of perforin, an effector molecule of cytotoxic cells, displayed a significant four- to fivefold increase in BD. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic comparative analysis of early untreated synovitis identifies neutrophils and T lymphocytes as important infiltrating cell populations in BD. Increased levels of perforin in BD suggest the relevance of cytotoxicity in this disease."

The mechanism of increased cathelicidin in psoriatic keratinocytes is not known, but recent observations have found that psoriasis has abundant Th17 cells that produce IL-17A and IL-22. We found that human keratinocytes stimulated with supernatants from T cells isolated from lesional psoriatic skin increased expression of cathelicidin when stimulated in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)). This increase was signaled through the IL-17RA. In vitro, IL-17A, but not IL-22, enhanced cathelicidin mRNA  and peptide expression in keratinocytes dependent on the presence of 1,25D(3). At the same time, coincubation with 1,25D(3) blocked induction of human beta-defensin 2 (HBD2), IL-6, and IL-8, which are other target genes of IL-17A. Act1, an adaptor associated with IL-17RA and essential for IL-17A signaling, mediated cathelicidin induction, as its suppression by small interfering RNA inhibited HBD2 and cathelicidin. Both, 1,25D(3) and IL-17A signaled cathelicidin  induction through MEK-ERK. These results suggest that increased IL-17A in psoriatic skin increases cathelicidin through a vitamin D(3)-, Act1-, and MEK-ERK-dependent mechanism.

Here, we aimed to study the function of CD4(+) T cells using this model. Lymphocytes isolated from  inflamed ears showed a significantly higher number of activated T cells, in contrast to the primarily naive lymphocytes isolated from blood. In addition, there was an increase in regulatory T cells (CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-/low)) within the skin. To clarify the function of CD4(+) cells, we depleted CD4(+) T cells using antibody. CD4 depletion resulted in augmented ear thickness and proinflammatory cytokine levels, indicating that CD4(+) T cells have a suppressive rather than a proinflammatory function in this model. Subsequently, sorted regulatory CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells were transferred to naive K14/VEGF transgenic mice before TPA challenge. CD4(+)CD25(+) T-cell transfer significantly reduced ear thickness and proinflammatory cytokine production compared to controls.

OBJECTIVES: To characterize the expression of the IL-17 isoforms and receptors in lesional and nonlesional psoriatic skin. Methods Keratome and punch biopsies taken from patients with psoriasis were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in order to measure the IL-17 isoforms and receptors. RESULTS: We demonstrated significantly increased mRNA expression of IL-17A, IL-17C and IL-17F in psoriatic skin. In contrast, the mRNA expression of IL-17B and IL-17D was significantly decreased in lesional compared with nonlesional skin, while IL-17E mRNA was undetectable. The increased mRNA expression of IL-17A, IL-17C and IL-17F was paralleled by an increased protein accumulation of  these cytokines in psoriatic skin. Analysis of the IL-17R mRNA expression revealed significantly impaired mRNA expression of IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD and  IL-17RE in lesional psoriatic skin, whereas the mRNA expression of IL-17RA was similar in lesional and nonlesional psoriatic skin.

Although it is becoming evident that many Th1 diseases including psoriasis have a strong IL-17 signal, the importance of Th17 T cells in AD is still unclear. We examined and compared skin biopsies from AD and  psoriasis patients by gene microarray, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. We found a reduced genomic expression of IL-23, IL-17, and IFN-gamma in AD compared with psoriasis. To define the effects of IL-17 and IL-22 on keratinocytes, we performed gene array studies with cytokine-treated keratinocytes. We found lipocalin 2 and numerous other innate defense genes to be selectively induced in keratinocytes by IL-17. IFN-gamma had no effect on antimicrobial gene-expression in keratinocytes. In AD skin lesions, protein and mRNA expression of lipocalin 2 and other innate defense genes (hBD2, elafin, LL37) were reduced compared with psoriasis. Although AD has been framed by the Th1/Th2 paradigm as a Th2 polar disease, we present evidence that the IL-23/Th17  axis is largely absent, perhaps accounting for recurrent skin infections in this  disease."

The genetic basis of psoriasis has been appreciated for nearly 100 years, but only recently have several of the genetic variants involved in psoriasis pathogenesis been identified. These genetic variants so far identified  are the HLA-Cw*0602 allele of the HLA-C gene on chromosome 6, the p40 subunit of  the IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines (IL12B), the IL-23 receptor and SNF313, a gene implicated in protein ubiquitinylation. Psoriasis patients have also been shown to have an increased number of copies of the beta-defensin gene cluster on chromosome 8. Beta-defensin 2, which is located in this region, is amongst the most highly up-regulated proteins in lesional skin and has cytokine-like properties in addition to potent antimicrobial activity. Although several additional genes remain to be identified, the variants that have so far been described support the autoimmune basis of psoriasis indicating that the disease may be mediated by T-cells reacting against (self)antigen(s) in the binding pocket of HLA-C, with contribution from the recently described Th17 subset of T-cells which are maintained by the IL-23 cytokine axis. These genetic variants together with pro-inflammatory environment caused by exaggerated antimicrobial response (beta-defensins) and dysregulation of signaling pathways (ubiquination), suggest the type of mechanism by which psoriasis can arise.

We tested stimuli that might account for this activity. Th1 cells and IFN-gamma are  increased in psoriatic blood and lesional skin. We show that IFN-gamma programs myeloid APCs to induce human IL-17(+) T cells via IL-1 and IL-23. IFN-gamma also  stimulates APC production of CCL20, supporting migration of IL-17(+) T cells, and synergizes with IL-17 in the production of human beta-defensin 2, an antimicrobial and chemotactic protein highly overexpressed by psoriatic keratinocytes.

TNF-alpha blockers may also affect adaptive immune responses by reducing T helper cell (Th)1 and Th17 responses, and favoring the development of T-regulatory cells. TNF-alpha antagonists can regulate differentiation and activation of osteoclasts, thus reducing bone destruction in psoriatic arthritis. Anti-TNF-alpha agents differ in their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodinamic properties, which is reflected in their therapeutic and safety profiles. The safety of TNF-alpha antagonists has been established, and patient selection and monitoring allow risk minimization."

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we sought to identify the cytokines produced by skin-resident T cells in normal skin, localize the receptors for these cytokines, and examine how these cytokines alter gene expression profiles of the cells bearing cognate receptors. METHODS: We used intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry to evaluate T cell cytokine production, and immunohistochemistry and double-label immunofluorescence to localize cytokine receptors in skin. Gene array analysis of cytokine-treated keratinocytes was performed using moderated paired t-test controlling for false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. RESULTS: We demonstrate that T-helper cells producing IL-17, IL-22 and/or IFN-gamma, as well as the cells bearing cognate cytokine receptors, are present in normal human skin. Keratinocytes stimulated with IL-17 expressed chemokines that were different from those induced by IFN-gamma, probably contributing to the influx of neutrophils, dendritic cells and memory T cells into the psoriatic lesion. In contrast, IL-22 downregulated genes associated with keratinocyte differentiation and caused epidermal alterations in an organotypic skin model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the Th17 cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 mediate  distinct downstream pathways that contribute to the psoriatic phenotype: IL-17 is more proinflammatory, while IL-22 retards keratinocyte differentiation."

These cells are implicated in different autoimmune disease models, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and  collagen-induced arthritis, but their involvement in human autoimmune disease has not yet been clearly established. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and functional properties of Th17 cells in healthy donors and in patients with different autoimmune diseases. METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 10 psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 10 ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 10 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 5 vitiligo patients, as well as from 25 healthy donors. Synovial tissue samples from a separate group of patients were also evaluated (obtained as paraffin-embedded sections). Peripheral blood cells were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry  and immunohistochemistry. Cytokine production was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and intracellular cytokine staining using specific monoclonal antibodies. Synovial tissue was examined for infiltrating T cells by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: We found increased numbers of circulating Th17 cells in the peripheral blood of patients with seronegative spondylarthritides (PsA and AS), but not in patients with RA or vitiligo. In addition, Th17 cells from the spondylarthritis patients showed advanced differentiation and were polyfunctional in terms of T cell receptor-driven cytokine production. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest a role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of certain human autoimmune disorders, in particular the seronegative spondylarthritides."

The importance of these cells for psoriasis pathogenesis is suggested by comparative T-cell and DC-cell counts, where DCs outnumber T cells.  We have previously identified CD11c(+)-blood dendritic cell antigen (BDCA)-1(+) cells as the main resident dermal DC population found in normal skin. We now show that psoriatic lesional skin has two populations of dermal DCs: (1) CD11c(+)BDCA-1(+) cells, which are phenotypically similar to those contained in normal skin and (2) CD11c(+)BDCA-1(-) cells, which are phenotypically immature and produce inflammatory cytokines. Although BDCA-1(+) DCs are not increased in number in psoriatic lesional skin compared with normal skin, BDCA-1(-) DCs are increased 30-fold. For functional studies, we FACS-sorted psoriatic dermal single-cell suspensions to isolate these two cutaneous DC populations, and cultured them as stimulators in an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction. Both BDCA-1(+) and BDCA-1(-) myeloid dermal DC populations induced T-cell proliferation, and polarized T cells to become T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells. In addition, psoriatic dermal DCs induced a population of activated T cells that simultaneously produced IL-17 and IFN-gamma, which was not induced by normal skin dermal DCs. As psoriasis is believed to be a mixed Th17/Th1 disease, it is possible that induction of these IL-17(+)IFN-gamma(+) cells is pathogenic. These cytokines, the T cells that produce them, and the inducing inflammatory DCs may all be important new therapeutic targets in psoriasis."

IL-17 is a highly inflammatory cytokine with robust effects on stromal cells in many tissues. Recent data in humans and mice suggest that Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of a diverse group of immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma. Initial reports also propose a role for Th17 cells in tumorigenesis and transplant rejection. Important differences, as well as many similarities, are emerging when the biology of Th17 cells in the mouse is compared with corresponding phenomena in humans. As our understanding of human Th17 biology grows, the mechanisms underlying many diseases are becoming more apparent, resulting in a new appreciation for both previously known and more recently discovered cytokines, chemokines, and feedback mechanisms. Given the strong association between excessive Th17 activity and human disease, new therapeutic approaches targeting Th17 cells are highly promising, but the potential safety of such treatments may be limited by the role of these cells in  normal host defenses against infection."

Psoriasis is thought to be driven primarily by CD4(+) T cells with a T(h)1 and/or T(h)17 phenotype. Transgenic keratin 14 (K14)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  mice have previously been reported to develop a psoriasis-like phenotype. The aim of this study was to further characterize the model for validation as an in vivo  screening model of psoriasis. Inflammation was induced in the ear skin with five  topical applications of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and a significantly increased inflammation was found in TPA-induced K14/VEGF transgenic animals compared with wild-type mice. The amount of VEGF in the ear tissue was significantly elevated resulting in increased dermal angiogenesis. Furthermore, intense epidermal hyperplasia, CD3(+) infiltration and significantly increased amounts of (TNF) tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12/23p40, IL-12p70, IL-22 and IL-17 were detected in the inflamed ear skin. This cytokine profile strongly suggests a T(h)17-mediated inflammation. All findings were a result of induced over-expression of VEGF. Topical treatment with betamethasone-17-valerate (BMS) significantly reduced ear skin inflammation and epidermal hyperplasia and also decreased the CD3(+) infiltration. In conclusion,  the TPA-induced phenotype in K14/VEGF animals displayed several features of psoriasis, including a T(h)17 cytokine profile and a chronic-like progression, and can be used as an in vivo screening model of psoriasis."

Results from a cytokine production and gene profile analysis identified a population of in vivo differentiatedretinoid-related orphan receptor gamma-expressing T cells, producing high levels of IL-17, that can represent up to 30% of infiltrating T lymphocytes. Activated Th17 cells produced IL-26, TNF-alpha, lymphotoxin-beta, and IL-22. IL-17 and IL-22 concentrations secreted by tissue infiltrating Th17 cells could reach up to 100 nM and were inversely correlated with the production  of Th1- and Th2-associated cytokines. In addition, tissue-infiltrating Th17 cells are also characterized by high cell surface expression of CCR6, a chemokine receptor that was not expressed by Th1 and Th2 cells, isolated from the same lesions, and by the production of CCL20/MIP3alpha, a CCR6 ligand, associated with tissue infiltration. Culture supernatants of activated Th17 cells, isolated from  psoriatic lesions, induced the expression of gene products associated with inflammation and abnormal keratinocyte differentiation in an IL-17 and IL-22-dependent manner.

Cyclosporine A (CSA) is considered a gold standard therapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. We conducted a clinical trial with CSA and analyzed the treatment outcome in blood and skin of 11 responding patients. In the skin, as expected, CSA modulated genes from activated T cells and the type 1 pathway (p40, IFN-gamma, and STAT-1-regulated genes). However, CSA also modulated genes from the newly described Th17 pathway (IL-17, IL-22, and downstream genes S100A12, DEFB-2, IL-1beta, SEPRINB3, LCN2, and CCL20). CSA also affected dendritic cells, reducing TNF and inducible NO synthase (products of inflammatory TNF- and inducible NO synthase-producing dendritic cells), CD83, and IL-23p19. We detected 220 early response genes (day 14 posttreatment) that were down-regulated by CSA. We classified >95% into proinflammatory or skin resident cells. More myeloid-derived than activated T cell genes were modulated by CSA (54 myeloid genes compared with 11 lymphocyte genes), supporting the hypothesis that myeloid derived genes contribute to pathogenic inflammation in psoriasis. In circulating mononuclear leukocytes, in stark contrast, no inflammatory gene activity was detected. Thus,  we have constructed a genomic signature of successful treatment of psoriasis which may serve as a reference to guide development of other new therapies.

Psoriatic lesions are sharply demarcated, red and slightly raised lesions with silver-whitish scales. The microscopic alterations of psoriatic plaques include an infiltration of immune cells in the dermis and epidermis, a dilatation and an increase in the number of blood vessels in the upper dermis, and a massively thickened epidermis with atypical keratinocyte differentiation. It is considered a fact that the immune system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Since the early 1990s, it has been assumed that T1 cells play the dominant role in the initiation and maintenance of psoriasis. However, the profound success of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy, when compared with T-cell depletion therapies, should provoke us to critically re-evaluate the current hypothesis for psoriasis pathogenesis. Recently made discoveries regarding other T-cell populations such as Th17 and regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, the keratinocyte signal transduction and novel cytokines including interleukin (IL)-22, IL-23 and IL-20, let us postulate  that the pathogenesis of psoriasis consists of distinct subsequent stages, in each of them different cell types playing a dominant role. Our model helps to explain the varied effectiveness of the currently tested immune modulating therapies and may enable the prediction of the success of future therapies."

Epub 2007 Aug 29.","Modulation of CLA, IL-12R, CD40L, and IL-2Ralpha expression and inhibition of IL-12- and IL-23-induced cytokine secretion by CNTO 1275.","Cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-12 causes differentiation of CD4+ T cells to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing T helper 1 (Th1) cells, while IL-23 induces differentiation to IL-17-producing pathogenic Th17 cells. The effects of the monoclonal antibody  to IL-12/23 p40 subunit (CNTO 1275) on IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) expression, markers associated with skin homing, activation, and cytokine secretion were investigated in vitro using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. PBMCs were activated in the presence or absence of recombinant human (rh) IL-12 or rhIL-23, with or without CNTO 1275. CNTO 1275 inhibited upregulation of CLA, IL-12R, IL-2Ralpha and CD40L expression and also inhibited IL-12- and IL-23-induced IFN-gamma, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-2, and IL-10 secretion. Thus, the therapeutic effect of CNTO 1275 may be attributed to the IL-12/23 neutralization, resulting in decreased expression of skin homing and activation markers, and IL-12- and IL-23-induced cytokine secretion."

Epub 2007 Aug 22.","Cytokines in arthritis--the big numbers move centre stage.","More than 20 yrs ago, T-helper lymphocytes were divided into Th1 and Th2 subsets  on the basis of their cytokine production. The pro-inflammatory Th1 subset was considered predominant in inflammatory arthritis, but evidence for this notion was incomplete, and some called into question the role of helper T cells. The identification of a novel T cell subset, Th17 cells, which appears to be critical for several forms of autoimmune inflammation, including arthritis, requires a reconsideration of arthritis pathogenesis and the role of T cells. This review deals with several of the newly described (big number) cytokines which are involved in the differentiation and action of Th17 cells, and pays particular attention to the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis because of the implication of  the same cytokine networks in psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. The role  of dendritic cells as coordinators of T cell differentiation in response to pathogen-derived signals in also emphasized."

J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci. 2007 Jun;27(3):330-2.","Expression of Th17 cytokines in skin lesions of patients with psoriasis.","In order to investigate the role of Th17 cytokines in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of IL-17, IL-23 (p19/p40), and IL-6 in skin lesions and non-lesions of the patients with psoriasis and skin tissues of normal subjects. The results showed that the mRNA expression levels of IL-17, IL-23p19, IL-23p40 and IL-6 in psoriasis lesion were significantly higher than those of non-lesions  (1.231 +/- 0.843 vs 1.003 +/- 0.044, 1.166 +/- 0.142 vs 0.765 +/- 0.133, 1.125 +/- 0.104 vs 0.730 +/- 0.103, 1.186 +/- 0.222 vs 0.976 +/- 0.122, respectively, all P < 0.05). Meanwhile, The expression levels of IL-17 mRNA, IL-23p19 mRNA, IL-23p40 mRNA and IL-6 mRNA were higher in non-lesions than those in normal skin  tissues (1.003 +/- 0.044 vs 0.620 +/- 0.104, 0.765 +/- 0.133 vs 0.584 +/- 0.078,  0.730 +/- 0.103 vs 0.000 +/- 0.000, 0.976 +/- 0.122 vs 0.656 +/- 0.121, respectively, all P < 0.05). The overexpression of Th17 cytokines in the skin lesions of patients with psoriasis may indicate that Th17 cytokines play a very important role in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis."
